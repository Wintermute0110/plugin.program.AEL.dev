    <story>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player&apos;s ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.</story>

    <story>90 Minutes: European Prime Goal is a soccer game with the 14 teams of the Japanese first division (J. League) to play with. In the European version they were replaced by national teams, but the some playing modes are still reminiscent of the origin. The available modes are exhibition matches, tournament, league, cup and all-star (the teams are divided into two leagues and the overall winner is decided with play-offs). With the option You&apos;re a Hero, the player can create a new athlete, change his stats with a few training lessons and swap it with an existing one. The player either controls the athlete who has the ball or, when in defense, the one who is nearest to it. The field is shown from a slightly angled side-perspective. During most modes, all teams can be taken over by human players, but only two can play at the same time.</story>

Most levels present Batman with a large number of henchmen to take out and environmental dangers to avoid on his way to one or more boss battles, but some deviate from the norm. For instance, Catwoman&apos;s stage is a large chase over Gotham City&apos;s rooftops with no enemies besides Catwoman herself. In the Penguin&apos;s level, Batman must navigate the dark corridors of Gotham City&apos;s museum, rescuing the staff. Two-Face&apos;s level is a driving sequence, seen from a top-down perspective.Besides kicks, throws and punches, Batman can use a variety of equipment against the enemies. Always available are Batarangs and the grappling hook. Before each mission, Batman can also select additional equipment, like knockout gas spray, throwing stars, smoke bombs and plastic explosives, all with limited ammunition. Special equipment required for certain levels include a flashlight, gas mask and X-ray goggles. If some necessary equipment is missing, it is always possible to return to the Batcave to change the gear and then restart the current level.Many of the situations and environments of the levels are based on episodes from the series and the game&apos;s graphics emulate the animation and drawing style of the show.</story>

Each event features a different vehicle to use. The player can choose from one of three vehicles which feature different attributes for handling, top speed, braking, and acceleration. The player begins by racing go-karts, then moves up to snow mobiles, then IROC racing cars, and then finally Indy racing cars. If the player places high enough in all the races, then the final challenge is to take on Al Unser, Jr. in the finals in Vancouver.

    <story>Disney&apos;s Aladdin is based on the 1992 Disney animated film. For the GBA and the SNES editions development was handled by Capcom. Like other versions, the game is a side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Aladdin through locations from the movie like the city of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, and Jafar&apos;s palace. Some locations not appearing in the film include a trippy, candy-colored world inside the Genie&apos;s lamp and an ancient pyramid. Enemies standing in Aladdin&apos;s way include the Sultan&apos;s guards, animals and various magical creatures. They can be dispatched by jumping on top of them or by throwing apples at them. Besides jumping and throwing, another one of Aladdin&apos;s abilities consists of him pulling out a blanket and using it to slow his fall.Besides the platform levels, the game also includes magic carpet rides as well as a bonus game played between levels: if Aladdin collects a golden scarab in a level, he can play a wheel of fortune for extra health, lives or continues.</story>

Once you have accomplished all missions in a stage, you move on to the next stage where you will receive new mission objectives. Missions are outlined via a terminal, and a series of blueprints help you navigate your way through the complex.Making your job difficult are several types of aliens, which can be killed by using pulse rifles, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers (which comes in three flavors). Med-kits can be picked up that will increase your health.</story>

Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</story>

If she hits one, she loses a chance and it&apos;s game over if she runs out of chances. She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot. You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level. You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit. You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these. You are awarded points for each correct match.When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice. This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left. On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up. This brings you to another magazine cover. You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie&apos;s hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover. Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.When you reach the left side of the level, you must then do Barbie&apos;s runway walk that you were given earlier. You are awarded points for each station at which you perform the correct move.Barbie then continues to the next level.

The options are a strength test, knocking down cans and a hit-the clown game. In the latter two, players can aim balls with the d-pad, then throw with the action button. Leading targets is required. The strength test has a mater that goes up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the indicator is on the bell to ring it.In Wyoming, Barbie goes camping. First, she must assemble her tent. This is essentially a jigsaw puzzle. Next, she must jump from rock to rock to get to the other side of the park where she can go on a nature hike. In the next segment, players aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks along the path and hit the action button to take photos. This requires good reaction time.There&apos;s a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride horses. The horse runs on its own. The player pushes the action button to make it jump. There are numerous gates on the course and the player must time jumps correctly to clear them. If they hit too many, they must start over. There is also the option to play horseshoes. The cursor moves about erratically and you must press the action button when it passes over the stake.In Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against Midge. This game allows both players to play simultaneously in two-player mode. Barbie and Midge can move forward or backward on the court and hit action to set the ball. First one to ten points wins. There is also a diving segment where barbies must navigate an underwater maze to collect sunken treasure. It might remind some people of Barbie&apos;s Ocean Discovery.Finally, there is Barbie&apos;s home in California. Ken has hidden presents around the house and Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.</story>

    <story>This game consists of five 3-day tournaments at four lakes. The mission is to catch as much large bass as possible. Once the day of the fishing tournament is over, the five largest bass that were caught get weighed and are compared to the other fisherman&apos;s catches. The one with the heaviest catch is the winner.The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the player can either go to the bait shop, practice pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish finders, and boat engines are available for purchase. The practice pond mode is just where the player can cut his teeth on the game mechanics without consequence.The tournament mode is the main part of the game. Players start out in a fishing boat. Some of the factors that can affect your fishing are temperature, wind speed, water clarity and time of day. After casting the line, the game goes from an above the lake view to a side view of the lake water depths. Then it&apos;s just up to the player to attract the fish with the bait, and after the fish is caught on the hook, reel it in.</story>

Players aim to become a professional fisherman and can travel by themselves or along with Hank.There are four different fishing areas players advance to as they win each round of the tournament. Players travel by boat on the water, select a fishing spot and then select lure and cast fish. Certain types of fish are only available at specific spots. There is also a fish radar that makes a sound when there is fish nearby. Players need to select the correct type of lure (there are about 20), keep track of weather conditions and the limited time available in tournaments. Some fish fight back hard and need to be reeled in with careful timing.The four tournaments are Local Amateur Tournament, Amateur Bass Championship, Pro Bass Tournament and Bassin&apos; World Championship. About eight types of fish can be caught.</story>

A prototype board of this game does exist, which is shown on the right. This board was owned by udisi, and sold on Ebay around February-March 2004. He mistakenly believed this was the game known as Real Shitty Batman!, however the screenshots that he took of the game clearly show it is Batman: Revenge of the Joker. Direct comparison with screenshots from the ROM image show that this prototype is identical. The game was developed by Icom Simulations in 1992 for Sunsoft. That company&apos;s most notable games include Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, Deja Vu, Shadowgate and Road Runner: Death Valley Rally.</story>

    <story>The successful movie sequel Batman Returns spawned many different game adaptations. The SNES version presents the story of Batman&apos;s encounter with the Penguin and Catwoman as a side-scrolling beat&apos;em&apos;up, with one Batmobile driving sequence thrown in.There are two varieties of the beat&apos;em&apos;up levels. One plays like Final Fight and similar games: Batman can move in two dimensions, beating up his enemies with various punches, kicks, combos and special moves.Special gadgets to be used include the famous Batarang to take out enemies from a distance and Test Tubes filled with chemical explosives which will damage all enemies on the screen.In the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman can only move in one dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.Enemies in the beat&apos;em&apos;up levels usually belong to the Penguin&apos;s Red Triangle Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes, clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level there is a boss fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.In the Batmobile driving level, the action is viewed from behind. Batman has to evade clowns on bikes and shoot them down when he gets the chance. At the end of the road, another boss fight awaits.Digitized images from the film illustrate the storyline.</story>

The Beast is rather slow but with a powerful claw strike and jump-stomp attack. He can also scale certain types of walls and can catch the edges of platforms. He also has a special roar that allows him to stun certain enemies. This becomes necessary in some sections in order to freeze bats so the Beast can use them as stepping stones to higher platforms.The game has a time limit in the form of the magical rose. The Beast must battle through such levels as the dungeon and the main hall battling giant spiders, rats, rogue candle monsters, live gargoyle statues, and enchanted brooms, while collecting books for points (since Belle likes books) and magic mirrors that allow the Beast to see further into the current level to anticipate what challenges await.</story>

There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat &apos;em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama&apos;s island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a taunt that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it&apos;s game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</story>

    <story>The people of Bizyland were hard-working and prosperous. However, Wagamama, the queen of Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her magic mirror. The spell that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working: notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were playing that day. Using the king&apos;s magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over each region.Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing one of the three characters, the player will begin each level only able to move around the edges. The player can start using the chalk to move away from the edges and draw a line over the darkened area and reach another edge. Once a section (always the smaller) is chalked off from the rest, it will be restored. Any treasure chests revealed will be opened for points bonuses. Different enemies will walk along the chalk lines or fly in between them. They can be destroyed by being in a section of the screen when it is restored.</story>

The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can&apos;t shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</story>

All missions are made up of these elements, however campaign missions also feature the ability to decide which aircraft to bring into battle, each with it&apos;s own statistics, and keep track of progress on an area map. When two forces engage each other on this map, players can choose which plane to bring into battle and it will close in a 1vs1 battle with the enemy. In dogfights, both players control an aircraft whereas during ship combat, one player controls an aircraft and the other will control the ship&apos;s turret gun. Aircraft controls include being able to tilt left and right, climb, dive, increase speed, decrease speed, fire guns, release bombs/torpedoes (if present) and do a 180 degree loop. Turret controls are more limited, only allowing the player to aim left and right, fire the gun and zoom.</story>

While the controls and basic gameplay haven&apos;t changed significantly, and the main goal of each level is still rescuing a certain number of hostages, Choplifter III is faster and more action-oriented than earlier Choplifter games.Enemies appear in larger variety and numbers now. They reappear more often and some levels feature fights against large bosses. To compensate for this, there are more power-ups (such as missiles, bombs, invisibility, etc.) available, and it is possible to have the helicopter repaired at certain points in a level.</story>

    <story>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca&apos;s invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new Techs - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them Magic Points to use in battle. The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat - adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it&apos;s even possible to just pass by them entirely. The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</story>

    <story>Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.As the nation&apos;s leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won&apos;t survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won&apos;t produce anything until you fix the situation. If you&apos;re ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you&apos;ll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they&apos;ll demand tribute from you), but eventually you&apos;ll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents&apos; units and cities (possibly taking over them). Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies&apos; cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you&apos;ll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you&apos;ll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you&apos;ll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there&apos;s too much of it, global warming may occur. How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you&apos;re living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it&apos;s a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.</story>

    <story>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</story>

Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States&apos; Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat.Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of P power-ups, left by defeated enemy. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen... but is constantly advancing towards new threats.</story>

You begin the game with a limited amount of fire power, but after shooting certain enemies power ups are left behind to increase your capabilities. Unlike many of the Darius games, if your ship is destroyed you don&apos;t lose all of the weapons you&apos;ve collected; likewise you also continue on at the same point rather than being sent back to a checkpoint. Similar to many of the Darius games there are different routes that can be taken towards the final stage. At the end of each stage, you are shown a map and can select the next stage you would like to complete.</story>

    <story>Christmas is a time where people get together and give others presents and spend all day eating food. But there&apos;s only one problem this year. You see, while Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold and evil snowman spooked all the elves away, and the Timekeeper has stolen Santa&apos;s plans from his house. There won&apos;t be any Christmas if Santa doesn&apos;t stop them.In Daze Before Christmas, you&apos;re Santa. According to the game&apos;s Christmas calender, you have 24 areas to explore such as factories, workshops, caves, and more. Each area is filled with nasty enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes, helicopters, snowmen, and many others. Furthermore, after every five areas, Santa has to come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, The Timekeeper, and Louse the Mouse, but also Mr. Weather.Santa&apos;s health is represented by five Santa hats. When Santa is hit by any one of his enemies, one hat is lost. If Santa loses all of his hats, then he will lose a life. He will then have to restart at the beginning of the area, unless he passes a gold bell somewhere in the area. When you explore each area, Santa can collect presents that contain a mini-Santa (aka: Extra Life), a red hat, or he may release an elf. Santa should be careful when opening these presents as some of them may contain bombs or other enemies. If Santa manages to find a spinning star, he must get it as this will take him to the next area.Santa kills his enemies by throwing magic at them. In almost each area, Santa can get a cup of hot cocoa. Doing this will transform him into Anti-Santa, a type of Santa who wears nothing but white, grows Satan&apos;s horns on top of his head, is invincible, and comes equipped with a hammer in which he can use to bonk enemies with. The Anti-Santa business only lasts for 20 seconds, but this can be changed via the Options menu.Daze acts like one of those platform games where you run through the level, shoot at enemies, and proceed to the exit. However, there are some areas where the gameplay changes, and these areas involve Santa flying through the sky in England, Russia, Japan, and the USA, and dropping presents in chimneys to score points. The game also uses a password-saving system, where entering a password given will allow gamers to restart at the beginning of a specific area, in case they happen to run out of lives.</story>

    <story>Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. As with the movie, the game takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. John Spartan is the country´s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of cryocons released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.The Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.</story>

But then six mysterious crests fell from the sky onto the earth, crests of six elements: fire, water, air, earth, time, and heaven. The demons became obsessed with the crests and with the power hidden in them, and so a civil war started. Finally, the Red Demon named Firebrand got all the crests but one - the crest of heaven. The Dragon Demon possessed this crest, so Firebrand decided to confront him. He defeated the Dragon Demon, but was himself severely wounded in battle. While flying back, he was knocked down by a mysterious enemy and lost his crests.You control Firebrand, a flying red demon, and your mission is to help him to gain his crests, and to defeat everybody who stands in his way. This is a platform action game: you fight the enemies in real time (using magical attacks), avoid obstacles, collect healing potions on the way, etc. Firebrand can also fly for a short time.</story>

Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson’s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.</story>

    <story>The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars&apos; moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.id Software&apos;s follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine&apos;s perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.DOOM&apos;s engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein&apos;s, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein&apos;s orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein&apos;s arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect &apos;frag&apos; points for a kill and re-spawn in a random location after being killed.</story>

You can play as SSJ2 Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Perfect Cell, Cell Jr., Bojack or Zangya. Goku and Broli will be also available after you enter a secret code.Some basic elements from Super Butouden have remained, such as the split screen system or the special attacks (which now are executed by a shorter button combination). However, now you will also count with the Meteo combos, which allow attacks with multiple hits. You can also hold down buttons in order to quickly recharge your energy. Special moves can be also fired back in retaliation to your rival&apos;s attack, marking then the beginning of a button smashing duel.There are 3 game modes, including a story mode that lets you choose different paths and changes depending on the outcome of battles; a 1 vs 1 mode, where you can battle against another player or the CPU; and a martial arts tournament mode with an eliminatory system in which you and other players (or the CPU) choose a character to become the winner.</story>

This title features the adventures of Goku from the battle against Piccolo in the martial arts tournament to the conclusion of the Cell Games.The initially available characters are Goku (without SSJ), Vegeta (without SSJ), C-20, C-16, Piccolo, Freezer, C-18 and Original Cell. But upon entering the right code you can expand the list with Future Trunks (SSJ), Gohan (SSJ), Perfect Cell, Goku (SSJ), and Vegeta (SSJ), all of them relegated to occasionally appear in the Story Mode either as rivals or as alternative selectable characters.In the story mode, players select which fighter to pit against each opponent as while advancing rounds leading up to the battle against Perfect Cell. Players can also go one-on-one against another player or a CPU opponent. There is also a martial arts tournament mode, to play against eight players or CPU opponents in a elimination tournament.</story>

    <story>Dragon Ball Z: Super Butōden 3 (known as Dragon Ball Z: Ultime Menace in France) is the last installment to the Super Butōden series for the SNES, which in this occasion is based on the Majin Buu saga. Avaliable charachers are Goku, Goten, Kid Trunks, Majin Vegita, Junior Gohan, Kaiohshin, Majin Boo, Darbura and C-18, plus another one available as a secret character: Future Trunks.Split screen mode is maintained, but now you can now fly up or down while on the same screen as your opponent. You can also struggle with your rival pushing with your arms together to test your button smashing abilities, or execute new Meteor Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly based on Buu saga) and will include alternative versions of themselves with different times of the day as well.The game allows you to take part either in a 8 player martial arts tournament with an eliminatory system or to make single combats against the CPU or another player. This makes Super Butōden 3 the only game of the series without a Story Mode. It can be explained by the fact that when the game was released while the Buu saga was still on a very early stage in Japanese TV.</story>

As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor, carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz. Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has conquered the world, and the only one who can stop him are 4 young kids: 3 boys and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones... Ness now must find the other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic powers, Jeff, a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam. Together, these four friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic reign!EarthBound is a top-down RPG where you travel around Eagleland and various other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas&apos; evil influence. On the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them in turn-based combat. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack with their weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other, unique special powers), use an item or try and escape. The game features &amp;amp;amp;quot;rolling HP meters&amp;amp;amp;quot; - when a character is dealt damage, it&apos;s not all taken away from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus become stronger. If your characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead of trying to attack them, and when chased down, they will be defeated instantly! Saving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness&apos; father. When you defeat enemies, your bank account receives money which can be then retrieved from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better equipment or useful items.</story>

    <story>Equinox is the sequel to the classic NES game Solstice. It&apos;s presented in a 3D isometric view with very colourful graphics. The game is based upon solving puzzles to progress to the next dungeon. In the game you play the son of the hero in the first game; Shadax. Shadax has been kidnapped by an evil witch and it is up to you to rescue him. There is a wide range of weapons and powerful magic spells you can use throughout your quest, some of which are required to solve puzzles. In Equinox, you can travel on the aboveground map as well as the underworld, although all the action except for some battles will still happen underground. If you have played any of Zelda games before, much of the game will be familiar: you must search for keys, blasting or avoiding monsters, solving physical puzzles on your way to meeting end-level guardian that you must defeat to progress.</story>

    <story>F-Zero is a futuristic racing game, set in the year 2560. The player chooses one of the four available hovercars and then can race with other hovercars in one of the gameplay modes - Practice or Grand Prix. In Practice mode, the player chooses one track where he competes with one other hovercar to win the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you so wish). In Grand Prix, the player must complete a series of races with several competitors. Each race consists of five laps. The hovercar has a limited Power meter, which represents the machine&apos;s health and decreases when the hovercar collides with the track boundaries and other players. If power runs out, the hovercar explodes and the player loses the race. There are repair areas near the start line, which restore power to the player&apos;s hovercar if he drives into them. The tracks contain many more or less dangerous traps, such as icefields or landmines. Completing a lap awards the player a Super Jet which can be activated at any time to give a short speed boost. The hovercar can keep up to three Super Jets and use them when necessary. Completing a lap also gives points, which give the player a life when enough are accumulated. The player can lose a life in the Grand Prix mode if his hovercar explodes, if his hovercar somehow falls out of the track or if he ends up too far behind the other racers.</story>

    <story>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football&apos;s world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as isometric) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</story>

    <story>Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game&apos;s commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum systemFIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it&apos;s possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you&apos;re not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</story>

    <story>Focus Tower is the center of the world and balances the forces of the world. However 4 monsters have taken the 4 elemental crystals (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind) for their own use, and also taken the 4 keys that for doors inside of Focus Tower. With the balance disrupted, disasters befall the world. A young boy by the name of Benjamin finds his home village destroyed. Meeting a mysterious old man while trying to escape from earthquakes, he soon learns that he is the prophesized hero and the only one who can save the world. Benjamin must recover the 4 crystals, unlock Focus Tower and defeat the ultimate monster before the 5th crystal, the Crystal of Life is corrupted.Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest is an RPG game, shown from an overhead view for movement within areas and using a 3rd person view for battles. The game is divided into areas on the world map between which the player can freely jump. These areas are divided into Towns, Dungeons and Battle Areas. Towns feature characters to interact and talk to, Dungeons are mazes filled with monsters and Battle Areas are instant battles with specific monsters, completion of which sometimes awards special items. Inside a Dungeon or Town, the player moves from an overhead view, with he ability to jump, use weapon at whatever is in front of the character, interact with NPCs and attack monsters.Unlike other Final Fantasy games, there are no random battles, all the enemies are visible to the player (or in specific Battle Areas). During battle, the game features turn-based combat (but not the ATB battle system used in other Final Fantasy games) where the player chooses from battle commands such as Attack, Defend, Item and Spells.Also unlike other Final Fantasy games, the player&apos;s party only ever consists of two characters: Benjamin and another character who can either by controlled manually or automatically by the AI. Benjamin can collect armor for 4 different parts of the body as well as 4 different kinds of weapons, however the other party member cannot have their equipment changed.Players can save at any point in the game. If the player is defeated in a battle, the game will let the battle be retried, but any items used will be lost.</story>

It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the second and third games were never released outside of Japan.The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King&apos;s actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the first and the third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.</story>

    <story>This is the sixth entry in the Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as magic.But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an Esper, being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.</story>

Since there are so many candidates, it is decided that the person who finds the Great Treasure of Sierra Madrock will become the new Great Poobah.The player takes control over Fred and Barney who also participate in the treasure hunt in order to make Fred the New Great Poobah.The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is a side-scrolling platformer that includes several board game elements. On a world map, Fred and Barney throw dices to determine how many fields they can move. There are different fields that hold different challenges.Most fields require you to finish a side-scrolling platforming level. Fred and Barney can jump, club their enemies and climb trees or stone pillars. Holding down the jump button lets them hover in the air for a short moment. Throughout the levels, different power-ups and items can be found: clamps are used as money, apples replenish some health, 100 stars grant an extra life to Barney or Fred and an empty Heart frame increases their life bar.On fields marked with a skull, a boss has to be defeated. Heart fields hold bonus games in which you have to collect as many items as possible within the time limit.At amusement parks, several mini-games can be played to win items or extra lives. Mini-games include: Memory; Balls O&apos; Fun&amp;amp;amp;quot;, where you can win items by throwing a ball at them; a mini-game in which you have to stop monkeys from climbing down trees and stealing your items by hitting them with coconuts and others.In Cafes you can buy food to replenish your health.In stadiums you can participate in special challenges (3D cart races for example), in order to gain new abilities such as double jumps.While stadiums, cafes and amusement parks can be revisited, all other levels only need to be finished once.Fred and Barney are not the only characters that move about the playing field. You will also run into their wives Betty and Thelma as well as other characters that are also looking for the treasure. When Fred or Barney encounter their wives, they are dragged a few fields back. Other characters give them useful items if you can beat them at a challenge (usually a race).Other notable features are a password system and a competitive 2-player mode.</story>

    <story>Before marketing fat-reducing grills, boxing legend George Foreman endorsed this boxing game with a 3rd-person view similar to Punch Out. A full range of punches and jabs are available, with full round-by-round scoring from the judges. You can choose from 3-12 rounds, and there are 2 camera views as well as an automatic switch option.You can play simple exhibition matches or tournaments, or launch into a career mode. In this you start at the bottom of the world rankings, and must reach the top by beating the game&apos;s players, who other than George are all fictitious boxers with varying strengths and weaknesses. The coach gives advice before each fight to help highlight weaknesses in your play. There are passwords for each round.</story>

    <story>Baseball player Frank Thomas licensed one of the first baseball games to use motion-captured 3D graphics and multiple camera angles. 28 stadia have been rendered in 3D, and each has its own visible and significant differences. There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it&apos;s best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</story>

    <story>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</story>

    <story>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</story>

    <story>In this isometric football game, 50 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls.While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his standard players, who won&apos;t do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:1. The Marker: can latch on an opposing player, stopping him from running away with the ball;2. Goalkeeper 1: more capable of stopping shots than the regular goalkeeper;3. Barger: this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path;4. Tricky: capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet, avoiding tackles;5. The Cheat: while it&apos;s hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking a defenders&apos; leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he&apos;s carrying it or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he&apos;s trying to pull an offensive foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties);6. Passer: capable of feeding forwards with laser-precision passes; 7. Striker 1: capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from virtually any position in the offensive area;8. Striker 2: best used from positions directly in front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal;9. Goalkeeper 2: features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers;In Exhibition games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa.</story>

    <story>Hebereke&apos;s Popoitto is a Tetris variant. The goal in each level is to remove the blocks already on the playfield, representing characters from the franchise. Other blocks fall down from the top of the screen and have to be steered to the right place before touching the ground or another block. When four or more of the same blocks are together, they vanish. The catch of this variant is that the blocks which have to be removed move over the playfield. The player takes the role of the penguin Hebereke who wants to win a tournament against his friends.</story>

    <story>Hebereke&apos;s Popoon is a falling block puzzle game which is always played against an opponent, either AI or human. Just like in Dr. Mario, there is always a pair of two blocks of varying colours falling down from the top of the screen. As long as they are falling, the blocks can be rotated. The goal is to bring three or more blocks of the same colour together; then they disappear and cause a special block to appear on the opponent&apos;s side. After a block vanishes, the blocks over it fall down. The match is lost, when the space the pair of blocks appear in is filled by another block, i.e. the screen is full.The game has eight characters and the special block mentioned above is the head of the own character. It can be only removed when matched with a block of the same colour. However, when the player manages to create a chain reaction one of two special attacks may be unleashed against the opponent, e.g. reversing the controls or obscuring the vision for 10 seconds. The attacks vary from character to character. During the campaign, the player initially takes control over Hebereke and has to defeat all other characters (best of three). After a character is defeated, it can be used for the next match. The tournament mode is a sequence of knockout matches. Here up to eight players can participate, but the matches itself are always one against one.</story>

    <story>Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway&apos;s Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team&apos;s goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a super shot which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a shot race mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</story>

Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed.

Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player&apos;s foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 lives takes you back tot he last restart point - losing one of your continues takes you to the start of the world.</story>

As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his world.The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.Graphics and sound remain faithful to the cartoony origins of the mascot.</story>

    <story>Unlike many Lord of the Ring games this game was actually produced many years before the LotR hype and based on the book and an older movie. Though the title suggests there should be more volumes, as far as I know the other two where never produced.In this game you play Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit. The game starts off at Bilbo&apos;s 111 birthday. Your first quest is to find Pippin. In your quest you will need to take the Ring to Rivendell. You start alone, but later on you will get others to join you in your quest, like Sam and Gandalf.The game was originally designed for the NES, but release was hold off and later on adapted for the SNES. Because of the original game design graphics are somewhat NES like and not all buttons of the controller are used. The cartridge does not contain any RAM/battery, games can only be saved by remembering a code. The code must later be entered into the game to continue.</story>

He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies and obstacles. He can jump and he can launch a large fist from his stomach (he is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block so that he is unable to move for several seconds.Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit knocks away all of his collected notes and if he gets hit again without having any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a variety of fruit throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types of fruit have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado = invincibility).</story>

    <story>This sequel puts you back into the roles of the cavemen, Joe and Mac. This time, a caveman named Gork has stolen the crown belonging to the Chief of Kali Village, and it&apos;s up to you to retrieve it by using the 7 Rainbow Stones you will collect on your journey.Along the way, you will fight dinosaurs, cavemen, and other prehistoric enemies as your travel through the jungle, or through the ice and snow, or even through a volcanic wasteland. Along the way, you can pick up upgrades for your club, or pick up projectiles from eating certain health-recovery items. In some levels, you&apos;ll ride in a stone cart, trying to hope over gaps and avoid enemies as you try to reach the end.Improving on the original&apos;s platformer/brawler co-op gameplay, this game adds adventure and role-playing game elements that create a more involving experience compared to the first game. You can now collect coins in the levels to purchase items from Tiki Village, such as meat to recover your health, or even remodel your hut back at your home village. The game also uses a password system to track your progress. The game also shifts to an overhead map so you can wander to whichever level you wish, and return to completed levels to earn more money or power-ups.</story>

    <story>Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name. The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence. Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</story>

Your goal is to find the human village so you may you join your kin once again. Mowgli is an athletic individual, and can jump, run, swing on vines or climb them without any problems. Most of the animals he comes upon, however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, such as bananas and boomerangs. To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a number of crystals (how many - it depends on the difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass in the corner of the screen helps him by showing the direction where the nearest crystal is.</story>

    <story>The SNES game based on the film Jurassic Park is an action title that combines top-down and first-person perspectives.Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player&apos;s ultimate goal is to escape the Jurassic Park island. To reach that goal, several other tasks must be completed, including restoring power to the park and destroying a Velociraptor nest. The large game world is seen from a top-down view and can be freely explored. Some areas are not accessible from the beginning, however. To enter them, keycards must be found or some special goal be completed, like rebooting the computer system and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can defend himself against the many free-roaming dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas grenade launcher and bola gun. All weapons except the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at the bottom of the screen helps in detecting approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once the park&apos;s motion detectors have been activated.Upon entering one of the park&apos;s buildings, the game view switches to a scrolling first person perspective, reminiscent of early first person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D. Just like outside, dinosaurs lurk in the corridors, and the same guns as in the overworld map can be used to destroy them. Many buildings consist of several floors, with elevators connecting them. Some rooms are pitch black and can only be entered when in possession of night vision goggles.The game supports the SNES mouse for the first-person sections and the computer system interface.</story>

You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.</story>

Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke, they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana&apos;s lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.King Arthur &amp;amp;amp;amp; the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.</story>

    <story>Kirby Super Star is another platformer in the Kirby series, distinguished for having an unusually versatile character, who can fly and gain the abilities of his foes.The game is actually a set of seven main games: Spring Breeze, Dynablade, Gourmet Race, The Great Cave Offensive are unlocked at first, and later Metaknight&apos;s Revenge, Milky Way Wishes and The Arena become available, as well as a couple of minor minigames.These are all typical Kirby platformers, each one with its own set of levels and different gameplay. In most of them you can consume monsters and learn their special abilities, but in Milky Way Wishes abilities are instead collected in a manner similar to Metroid. Offensive Cave features levels with various obstacles, hidden treasures and some elementary lever-pulling kind of puzzle solving. Metaknight&apos;s Revenge is the only game on the cartridge with a (fairly strict) timer. The Arena is a boss rush mode, asking players to defeat every boss in the game with limited health refills and on one life.Kirby Super Star is best known for its two-player cooperative play option, which has given it a reputation as a party game.</story>

After his adventures in Dream Land we find him in this mini golf game where Kirby himself is the ball, and you must guide him around each hole using the sort of bar system that you see in most golf games. Where this game differs, however, is in the fact that you need to eliminate all on-screen enemies before you can guide Kirby into the hole and complete it. As per usual in golf games, the more strokes it takes you to complete the whole, the lower your score - so make sure you aim Kirby just right!You&apos;ll find eight courses and a total of sixty-four holes in the game, not including the final showdown with King Dedede, as well as an action-packed two-player mode.</story>

    <story>In Knights of the Round, play the role of one of three knights from the Arthurian legends. The three characters are Sir Lancelot, Sir Percival, and of course King Arthur. The story tells of a man who pulled the mighty sword Excalibur from a rock which no one else could achieve. This feat signified that he should be king of the Britons and lead them to peace. The trouble is there is mass chaos in the land and the only way Arthur can stop it is to find the holy grail which has been hidden for over a thousand years. Aurthur is joined by Percival and Lancelot on his quest to find the grail. The gameplay involves the player to scroll along the screen fighting of enemies with a sword or axe depending on the character. The player can also block and parry with opponents which is done by a simple button press. There are also character development elements in the game where collecting points by killing enemies and picking up gold increase the character&apos;s attack and speed. Character&apos;s armour and weapons also change when they gain experience.</story>

    <story>Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 racetracks across America. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back.Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.</story>

    <story>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in Project 5, a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe&apos;s intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe&apos;s best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</story>

Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.At the end of each village is an &amp;amp;amp;quot;action area&amp;amp;amp;quot; which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.</story>

    <story>Recently, famine and drought have plagued Hyrule. When all seemed lost, a mysterious wizard, Agahnim, appeared, and stopped these strange happenings from occurring. But there is talk that Agahnim now rules the country with his magic, behind the scenes. And then, one night, the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, calls out for help...and the one who hears her pleas is a young lad named Link...The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is a top-down action adventure game (similar to the original Legend of Zelda) for the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance. Players assume the role of Link, and their goal is to rescue Princess Zelda and save the land of Hyrule. Unlike turn-based RPGs, all combat in Link to the Past is in real-time - you swing your sword at enemies by pressing a button, or can spin the sword around you for a more powerful attack by holding down the button until it is charged.Progression through the game is done by conquering a series of dungeons - each dungeon has its own special item associated with it, such as the hookshot (which latches onto a far-off object and pulls Link across) or the hammer (which can be used to flatten objects in your way). Most of these dungeons are rendered impassable until the dungeon&apos;s particular item is acquired; from there, the rest of the dungeon becomes accessible due to Link&apos;s latest new ability. The bosses of each dungeon are also themed to that level&apos;s particular item.Link starts out with only three units of health; however, these can be increased by defeating dungeon bosses, which give one additional heart container, or by finding four &apos;pieces of heart&apos;; which can be given for anything from passing a small trial to winning a mini-game. Some of Link&apos;s items also use magic - this can be refilled with collectible green magic pots. After defeating the initial three dungeons, Link gains access to the Dark World - many puzzles and difficulties come from alternating between the Light World (Hyrule) and the Dark World to make your way past previously impassable obstacles.The Game Boy Advance version of the game also includes a special extra dungeon. In addition to this, there is the first multiplayer Zelda game ever: Four Swords. In this game puzzles are based around co-operation with other players - for example, picking up an enemy and throwing it at another player which allows its weak point to be hit, or a boss which only shows the weak point you can hit on an opponent&apos;s screen. However, the game also contains an element of competitiveness - whoever gains the most rupees at the end of the level wins a bonus medal. Collect enough of these and you can unlock a special quest in A Link to the Past.</story>

    <story>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.</story>

Feeling a little tired from playing video games late the night before, he looked around for a comfortable place to finish his comic.Without thinking, Lester stretched out on a pallet that was ready for loading onto a nearby freighter. And fell asleep.Boy, did he pick a bad place to take a nap. Several hours out of port he woke up and found himself in deep trouble (and more than a little seasick). The ship&apos;s captain believed his story about being an accidental stowaway. But... only in cases of extreme medical emergency could the ship return to port. And Lester wasn&apos;t that seasick. Yet...So, he was along for the ride... until the first port of call. But as chance would have it, pirates hijacked and scuttled the freighter. Luckily enough, Lester found a life vest before the ship sank and swam for the nearest tropical island.Just before reaching the beach Lester passed out from sheer exhaustion. Now, his real adventure begins...It is up to you to help Lester get back home.You&apos;ll face such things as giant seagulls, panthers, pirates, and the spirits of the underworld.</story>

    <story>The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt.

    <story>Young Simba just can&apos;t wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba&apos;s father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;amp;amp;quot;roar meter&amp;amp;amp;quot; to charge. As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you&apos;re skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</story>

However, Looney Tunes is much more informal and silly, though this level of silliness is set by the player via the Wackiness Meter on the main menu. Players choose their teams from the likes of: Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, Tasmanian Devil, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam and Marvin Martian. Each player has unique statistics for their shooting, 3-pointers, defense, stamina and speed.Once on the court, the player can pass the ball, shoot the ball, grab a burst of speed or unleash a special defensive ability or a special offensive ability.. These abilities include cream pies, time bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun toys from the ACME Corporation. Offensive Abilities must be bought by collecting gems and other items which occasionally show up on the basketball court.</story>

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</story>

To do this, you must defeat his army that stands in your way with whatever weapon you are carrying. Health is decreased by coming into contact with various monsters, attacks, traps, and the passage of time. It is increased by finding food. Every certain amount of points, a Food Fairy appears and drops off food as well.Throughout your journey, you can smash open chests to find treasure and artifacts. Some of these artifacts can be recovered that alter gameplay, such as providing more damage or increased magical power. Also throughout your journey, you can collect keys, which are used to free imprisoned allies, who not only help you defeat monsters, but also leave you an item that will help you on your quest. Only one person can join you at a time.As you progress through the tower, you will be granted new magical weapons after each boss you defeat. The weapons are affected by a magic bar that charges over time. When this bar is fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by jumping and attacking, but doing this costs health.There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.</story>

This time he&apos;s set up his headquarters in Antarctica and created portals to 25 famous cities around the world, so that his Koopas can wreak havoc in our own world. He&apos;s also kidnapped Mario, hence the title of this game. You play as Luigi who must foil Bowser&apos;s plans by entering through each of the portals, tracking down the Koopas who have stolen famous artifacts, and looking for clues about your location. Once you&apos;ve set everything right and determined where you are, you call Yoshi on your Globulator so he can track you down. You need Yoshi&apos;s help to eat the Pokey (a cactus-like creature) that&apos;s guarding the return portal, and when Luigi returns he can close the portal forever.By exploring these 25 cities, children can familiarize themselves with the landmarks and artifacts that each city has. When Luigi returns the stolen artifacts to the proper places he can even take photographs of them. There is also an add-on disk you can purchase that adds ten additional cities to the game (it originally retailed for $24.95).</story>

    <story>Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems is a side-scrolling platformer/beat &apos;em up based on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline from the comics. Adam Warlock calls on the heroes to recover the 6 Infinity Gems before they are used for evil.You may choose ones of five heroes: Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Wolverine. Each one has different stats and abilities. (i.e. Spider-Man is agile. Hulk is strong, Iron Man can double-jump with his rocket boots, etc.) Initially you can choose a training area in Avenger headquarters or four levels. As you complete levels, most open up. Each hero can be equipped with gems to boost their abilities in each section. These must be obtained by finding them in the levels.Gameplay is fairly similar to X-Men-Mutant Apocalypse. Combat is all on a 2D plane. Each hero has basic jumps and attacks and special moves that can be executed with button combinations like quarter-rolls. Enemies include various villains from the Marvel Universe and evil doubles of various Marvel heroes.</story>

    <story>A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, Math Blaster: In Search of Spot is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn maths while having fun.The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals, percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets (present in the PC version only).Math Blaster&apos;s friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately, for practice or for score.The activities are as follows:1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam to collect space trash.2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you collected into fuel.3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster&apos;s jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien&apos;s spaceship displays an equation, and the four portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time limit.Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a high score board for their account.</story>

Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he&apos;ll encounter throughout his adventure, he&apos;s going to need all the help he can get.As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls. Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs. It&apos;s also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he&apos;ll be able to transform into Ninja Maui. Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff. In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his jump. He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he normally couldn&apos;t. You&apos;ll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, otherwise you&apos;ll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.</story>

    <story>You are Gideon Braver Vandenburg, heir to the planet. While you were away, unknown attackers destroyed your home, killed your entire family, and stole the Chalice that you need to win the throne. When you are implicated in your own family&apos;s death, you are forced into exile. With a help of an old friend who contributed an old Jenner and some credits, you must become a mercenary. You must travel the Inner Sphere in search of clues to who set you up, and eventually avenge your family and recover the Chalice. You have five years. Good luck and good hunting. Mechwarrior was the first 3D BattleTech game developed. Dynamix (who later developed the Starsiege series) created it for Activision. You go to a planet and in search of fixers who will set up some contracts with the local authorities. The terms are a flat payment and some salvage payments. Some houses are very stingy but they tell you a lot about the mission. Others pay well but may not tell you everything. You can buy/sell/repair &apos;Mechs, hire/fire pilots, decide which planet to move to, as you try to maintain decent relationships with all five houses of the Inner Sphere, while trying to uncover clues about where you need to go. This ground-breaking game is very replayable, as each mission is randomly generated. There&apos;s even some extended campaigns where you run 2-3 missions in a row. (The following is the plot from the SNES version of Mechwarrior.)You are Herras Ragen. When you were 12 (3017) your father Colonel Joseph T. Ragen, a soldier in the House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance and he had got in over his head. Somehow the members of the cartel got the location of your family&apos;s house on Redondo leaked to them from an unknown source. Before making their covert strike the lance made an agreement that they would separate for 10 years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations.One night the Lance attacked your families home killing everyone inside. Over at a friend&apos;s you heard sounds of explosions. Rushing home you found a roaring inferno of what used to be the home you grew up with your family. Newly orphaned you vowed revenge on whoever had done this.The year is 3027. Now a young man, you cannot serve House Davion after what happened all those years ago. Now you make your living working as a freelance Mercenary on the planet Galatea selling your services to anyone whose contract will lead you closer to the insidious Dark Wing Lance.</story>

    <story>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final &apos;Mother of All Battles&apos; has its own surprises. Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.Later on higher levels, you&apos;ll also build mines and factories, as you&apos;ll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you&apos;re on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you&apos;ll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don&apos;t be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you&apos;ll need to invent everything for that one again.</story>

Dr. Light immediately responds by forming a soccer team of Mega Mans to counter Dr. Wily&apos;s latest scheme.Mega Man Soccer is an overhead view soccer game featuring characters from the Mega Man series. Players begin by selecting either Exhibition, Tournament, League or Capcom Championship modes. Depending on the mode, a team must be formed using either all of one type of robot, or a mixture of different types assigned to different positions on the field. In any case, each soccer team has 8 players on the field including the goalie. The goal of each team is to score on the net of the opposing team, earning points to win the game. The action follows the ball as it is tossed around the field from player to player. Once a player&apos;s team member has the ball they can choose to pass it to another teammate, shoot the ball straight ahead or perform a clearing kick (if the goalie). If the player does not have the ball, they are given control of the nearest player to the ball and can slide tackles or shoulder tackles to try to gain possession. Each type of robot has a special move that can be initiated.</story>

    <story>Following the events of Battle Clash, the Battle Game Chiefs had been defeated. But the world did not return to peace and instead new Chiefs and new machines rose up to rule the world. Like before, the Chiefs use giant robots known as Standing Tanks (STs). Seeing the world in trouble, the hero pilots who had defeated the Battle Chiefs decide to once again enter the Battle Game using an improved version of their ST, the Falcon. The truth behind the Battle Game will take the Falcon deep into space...Metal Combat: Falcon&apos;s Revenge is a first person shooter designed for the Super Scope Light Gun. Gameplay is identical to Battle Clash. The player takes the role of the gunner of the giant robot, movement is handled automatically by the game, scrolling the screen. Players must keep the enemy robot in the gunsights and blast away at different parts of it, while also intercepting enemy missiles and counter-attacks. All robots have a weak point that will increase the damage done to them. Power-ups such as Neutron Beams and Plasma Bombs can be picked up following the completion of certain stages, and equipped at the beginning of combat.</story>

    <story>The Antimatter Cold War has left Earth ruined as the stockpiled AM weapons of various nations were triggered in a chain effect, vaporizing large portions of the Earth. The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans. During this turmoil, Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost. The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs. At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.</story>

As their ambassador, they choose to send the Metal Morph, a being made from living metal, as he is the only being that can survive the inter-dimensional travel. The people of Earth have created a Hypergate, which links the two galaxies together. Upon arriving at the alien destination, the Metal Morph is quickly ambushed and is taken to an alien lab for study so that they can travel through the Hypergate themselves. The Metal Morph quickly escapes and begins to get back to his sabotaged ship...Metal Morph is a side-scrolling platformer. As the Metal Morph, you can jump, duck and shoot, as well as transform into an invulnerable liquid blob of metal. While as a blob, you can also travel through pipes to get to areas you couldn&apos;t normally. Power ups such as triple shots and homing missiles make battle easier for you.The game also has sections where you fly your spaceship to track down your stolen pods. In flight mode, you can move the ship up, down, left and right while shooting enemies and dodging their incoming shots. Power ups such as speed up (which makes the ship travel faster to its destination) and shields (which prevent instant death) can also be found.</story>

As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.Mickey&apos;s Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with.

After completing one task, they&apos;ll receive a gift.After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy&apos;s task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</story>

    <story>If you&apos;re bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</story>

In this game, you can choice among 8 playable characters: the Power Rangers&apos; Zords (Thunder Megazord, Mega Tigerzord, Ninja Megazord, Shogun Megazord) or some of their known villains (Lipsyncher, Silver Horns, Goldar, Lord Zedd). The title offers 3 game modes: Story Mode (1-Player only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player only).During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 Zords, the 4 villains up to Lord Zedd and last, but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can opt by the Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord (formed in conjunction with the White Ranger). The Fighting Mode is an traditional 2-Player head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of the 4 Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is a Endurance-like option, and the main goal is to win as many battles as possible using only 1 health bar (that will be partially replenished after each battle).As well as many fighting games, you can take advantage of a Power Bar (here, it fills automatically): if you execute a Super Move when this bar is flashing, it will be cause more damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you having reached its maximum status, it&apos;s possible to execute power-up versions of Special Moves or even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).</story>

There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers. Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter.

    <story>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung&apos;s mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a Fatality on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game&apos;s fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

    <story>The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</story>

    <story>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn&apos;s extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population&apos;s souls.A small team of Raiden&apos;s Chosen Warriors survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, Dial-A-Combo attacks, a Run button to speed up the battles, and Vs. codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</story>

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of Junior.</story>

    <story>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:1. &amp;amp;amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;amp;amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;amp;amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;amp;amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.&amp;amp;amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;amp;amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.&amp;amp;amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;amp;amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</story>

    <story>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.</story>

    <story>It&apos;s very simple... the NFL is football and this is the only officially licensed NFL game for the NES... the closest thing to real professional football that you can play without a helmet and shoulder pads. You can select any of the American and National Conference teams, and if you&apos;re good enough, you can take them all the way to the Super Bowl! Team rosters are broken down into positions and individually rated according to skills, with position upgrade packages, player ability handicapping, actual NFL Offensive and Defensive Playbook alignments with audibles and even variable wind direction and strength. You not only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one football game you&apos;ve got to have!</story>

    <story>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL &apos;94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series.Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or regular season in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides). While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</story>

    <story>NHL 96 was the first EA Sports game to feature Virtual Stadium technology, which resulted in a 3D feel and multiple camera angles. The NHL license ensures that real teams and players of the era are included, with a full league and playoff system. Many game options can be toggled - the infamous fighting is option, as are the penalties and offsides. The control system makes it possible to execute one-touch passes, and several special trick moves to quickly advance the ball. As a bonus feature, it included &apos;Hockey Card&apos; profiles of every player on CD, and interviews with the stars of the game.</story>

    <story>Nickelodeon GUTS is based off of the Nickelodeon TV show in the late 90&apos;s that is basically American Gladiators for kids. The events in the game are based off of the actual game show events with the main goal being to score as many points as possible while trying to beat the clock.In Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced around. There are three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, Attack is lacrosse and Spiral where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging tire.Action Sports is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and is divided into two events: Basic Training involves poles, swinging ropes and punching bags and Tornado Run which adds water jets and moving platforms. Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and a chance at the bonus round.The final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant indoor mountain the player must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents. The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.There is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event. Elastic lets the players compete against each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be played through alternating play.</story>

The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</story>

    <story>In the 16th century, Japan&apos;s Sengoku (Warring States) period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei&apos;s better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp;amp;amp;amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender&apos;s region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</story>

    <story>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the gold points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</story>

    <story>There&apos;s a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball. The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.That&apos;s right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level&apos;s goal before the timer ticks down to zero. The game might as well have been named inertia. Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing. Some influence the ball&apos;s direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball&apos;s progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES&apos; Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.(Now if only someone could explain the Camel part - referencing the Japanese title.)</story>

    <story>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren&apos;t released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you&apos;re shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.You also have a life bar to worry about. If you&apos;re shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you &apos;ll lose energy, and once you&apos;re energy is depleted, you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose, and you can&apos;t easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane, proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you&apos;re going to use rocket bombs.There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you&apos;ve saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</story>

    <story>You play Lester, a young physics professor, who suddenly finds himself in a strange alien world after a lightning struck during his particle experiment. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens, who together with him escapes from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is concealed behind what looks like a typical platform shooter. The gameplay is based mainly on physical and environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a different strategy, and often there is only one way to solve the problem. Typically, enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the gun can be used to create a shield from behind which you can safely fire. The game is divided into levels, each one of which can be accessed by typing a code you learn after having completed the level. If you die (which is often) you restart the level anew. The game features vector graphics and animated cut scenes.</story>

    <story>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members&apos; attacks and to avoid running out of gas.The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you&apos;ll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.</story>

    <story>Based on Namco&apos;s Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man&apos;s directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a wall on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It&apos;s similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man&apos;s direction with the press of a button.All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</story>

Super attacks damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue. If a character is hit repeatedly, there is a chance that they temporarily switch into angry-mode during which they are invincible and more powerful. Most levels offer different paths and exits, and after every level, a different character may be selected.

It&apos;s possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</story>

    <story>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy &apos;links&apos; course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</story>

    <story>You&apos;re playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you&apos;re goin&apos; in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It&apos;s path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you&apos;ll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don&apos;t expect much, but to retry the level.Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it&apos;ll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, &apos;til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that&apos;s the game basics.Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you&apos;ll have to solve each level in a hurry.</story>

He can also explode himself and absorb other objects, even becoming them physically to gain an advantage.There are stars littered around the level, and collecting these upgrades Putty&apos;s abilities, starting with a super punch for 10 stars, going up to the Terminator ability for 40. The pups from the previous game are no longer on your side, and are out to get you. These have all manner of abilities - shooting mortar bombs at you, paradropping towards you, and even flying a helicopter.</story>

    <story>RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware&apos;s R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art&apos;s Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock &apos;n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer.Combat, obstacles, and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro, and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks, and armor.There are full race season, single race, and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle.In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before.Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track&apos;s laps, gravity, and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction, and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section&apos;s design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2, and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.</story>

    <story>Based on the Nickelodeon cartoon, Fire Dogs was one of the episodes in the first season and inspires this game cartridge. You start as the dimwitted cat Stimpy who has to search through the different levels of a firehouse to find these objects to proceed: a helmet, hose, pair of socks, rope, trampoline, uniform, and a beaver(!). They all have to be placed on a fire truck before time runs out. You can jump, climb up stairs and firepoles, and grab items while avoiding or putting out fires with water and eluding a speedy fireman by painting yourself like a dalmatian to avoid getting thrown out. A short 30 second bonus round follows where you must find Ren, the psychotic chihuahua. This is followed by another 30 second round to bounce as many bags of Gritty Kitty Litter into a bin as you can.The second level has both Ren and Stimpy holding the trampoline to catch objects falling from a burning building. Again, there is a time limit by which all items must be caught. If successful, you return to the firehouse again the next day and must survive a week to gain the award of the Sacred Golden Fire Hydrant Helmets.</story>

    <story>This game comes at you with a Fantastic Voyage tale of a microsurgeon miniaturized to a near-microscopic scale in order to enter the body and save the life of a tobacco salesman, ironically laid low by health complications caused by the very cigarettes he sold. Rex must be asking himself, My parents put a mortgage on their house to put me through eight years of medical school just so I could scrub tar off someone&apos;s lungs like a window-washer? But it gets worse: Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting to silence the turnabout whistleblowing revelation they anticipate in the unlikely event of this salesman&apos;s recovery, have some shrinking technology of their own, and have introduced sinister nanobots into his body to ensure his -- and Rex&apos;s -- untimely demises.Washing off goo and attempting to survive the robot sprites&apos; poor collision-detection routines comprise the large part of this game (albeit in exotic, well-rendered environments such as The Mouth, The Heart, The Lungs, and eventually The Brain -- where you struggle to clean up regenerating blobs of nicotine addiction); sporadically you also encounter mines which grill you on smoking-related health facts and myths, rewarding correct answers and blowing up when presented with falsehoods. Though the majority of the game plays like a 2D platform shooter, there are also over-the-shoulder 1st-person inter-level sequences where you pilot a futuristic vessel through bronchial tubes and blood vessels like something out of Space Harrier or Tempest -- only with more globs of diseased sputum zooming straight toward you.</story>

When you reach the ending, if you&apos;re fast enough, you&apos;ll also get a time bonus, but if you&apos;re good enough, you&apos;ll get a flag bonus. Some of the flags are INCREDIBLY difficult to find, and the fact that you won&apos;t usually be able to find them, will challenge (or at least frustrate) most gamers.

When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a ‘ball’. The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball. The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.</story>

The game concept is still the same, though they did improve a lot of features that one may consider &apos;disturbing&apos; from RTK I (e.g. Generals dying easily due to disease, etc.). RTK can be said to be much more &apos;stable&apos; where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar to Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition II.</story>

    <story>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various &apos;mission areas&apos; where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.The vehicles you have at your command include1. Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp;amp;amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right2. Stinger: A prototype next generation attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.3. Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill4. Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it&apos;s orientation between left and right. It&apos;s weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport5. Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It&apos;s main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches6. Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</story>

But as evil forces took control of Mana Fortress, there was no way out but a war which destroyed the Mana-based civilization but eventually brought peace to people. The events of the past became but legends to the new generation of humans. But history repeats itself... One day, a young village boy finds a rusty sword stuck at the bottom of a river. He doesn&apos;t know this sword is the famous Mana sword, the one that won so many battles before. By drawing the sword out of the river bottom, the boy unwillingly summons hordes of monsters, and is expelled from his village. A mysterious knight Jema is the only man who helps him and gives him instructions for the future. First, he must repair the sword, and then, with its help, take control of Mana seeds which can be found in eight great castles.Secret of Mana is an action RPG, featuring real-time hack-and-slash type of a combat.

    <story>The SNES version of Shadowrun appeared earlier than the Genesis one, and it is an entirely different game, with different story and gameplay, although it is also based on a pen-and-paper RPG of the same name. Your hero, Jake, is attacked by assassins, and appears to be dead. However, a mysterious dog approaches his lifeless body, transforms into a woman, and casts a spell on him... After that Jake wakes up in the morgue. He doesn&apos;t know what happened to him, he doesn&apos;t even remember his own name. Wandering through the futuristic city, where monorails, computers, and street gangs armed with automatic weapons co-exist with orcs, dwarves, and vampires, you begin to discover the mystery and to learn about the dangers awaiting you around every corner.Shadowrun for SNES is a skill-based RPG that uses real time combat. You can hire deckers, i.e., temporary party members, but the main focus of the gameplay is on Jake and his abilities and skills. There are no random battles, but many screens with respawning enemies, where you can earn experience points and upgrade your skills. The experience points are called karma in this game. You need to gain karma in order to advance in one of the several skills available to you. You&apos;ll also be able to buy skills from people. The skills include firearms, computers, negotiation, leadership, and many others. You can also use the gained karma points to upgrade basic stats like hit points or charisma.</story>

There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don&apos;t but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city&apos;s size grows so do it&apos;s needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets.

    <story>Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and shipsmarts.In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can&apos;t use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.Each level has a certain save limit, meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you&apos;d better be on time with some assistance.At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.</story>

    <story>The pirate Sküljagger and his crew hold the island of Westica hostage. Forcing the people who live there to be his slaves, Sküljagger rules unopposed with an iron fist. A brave sailor named Storm Jaxon decides to rebel and steal Sküljagger&apos;s magical sword. Now he must fight for his life and ultimately to free the Westican people.Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a sidescrolling platform game. Players select between a 1 player game, an alternating turn 2 player game or Bubblegum Practice. The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right, jump and swing Sküljagger&apos;s magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests, boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.In addition to the power-ups listed above, fruity bubblegum can also be found. Only one bubble gum flavor can be carried at a time and it will be held until the player activates it. Grape bubblegum encases Storm in a giant invulnerable bubble that can bounce higher than jumping alone. Cherry bubblegum will require the player to inflate manually, but will allow Storm to fly. Beware as over inflating the bubble will pop it. Watermelon bubblegum will turn Storm into a projectile that damages anything on the screen, also gathering items. Orange bubblegum will let Storm spit out pellets at enemies which will destroy them. Bubblegum power-ups can be tested in the special bubblegum practice option of the menu.</story>

    <story>The controls of Smash Tennis work similar to other tennis games and especially Namco&apos;s previous tennis game World Court Tennis: the player moves the athlete over the court and presses buttons with the correct timing in order to win the match. This time there is no story mode, but a tournament mode instead. Here the goal is to win the Grand Slam by playing various tournament matches. However. a match only has a single set. There are 20 athletes (both male and female) to choose from which have different advantages and drawbacks.The exhibition matches are more free form: the player can choose the conditions of the match, especially the surface which influences the ball physics. Some of them are recreations of realistic tennis stadiums, others are fictional places like a strand or in front of a temple. Here there are optical gags built in, e.g. a mountaineer who falls down when hit with the ball. The Whistle-Stop-Tour allows to play against the same opponent on multiple surfaces.</story>

    <story>Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurfs&apos; laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows them to travel to anywhere in the world, but suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home.A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield. There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or vines). While large falls don&apos;t harm the Smurfs, improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages there&apos;s a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up is awarded.</story>

    <story>Follow the further story of Snow White after the evil Queen&apos;s death. Her brother Lord Maliss, who can take the form of a dragon, changes Snow White&apos;s Prince into a monster Shadow Man. You can play as Snow White or Shadow Man and must go through eight levels full of platform obstacles and enemies to free the kingdom from his evil sorcery. This side-scrolling platformer is based on an animated movie by Filmation released in 1993.You collect fruit and stars through each level and can jump on some enemies or throw apples at them (which are also used to break through blocks). Be careful as you jump on platforms as going to close to the edge can cause you to lose balance and fall. On the screen, your health is shown by a heart. If you get hit by an enemy, fall down a pit, or fall from too high, it will decrease by one. If it reaches zero, you lose one of three lives. Some special attacks can be used, if possessed, like apple bombs. Eventually a sign Find The Exit will appear and you can exit to the next level. If you make it to the end, you must fight Maliss in dragon form. You can change the difficulty level or choose a continuous play option as well.</story>

    <story>The date is Tuesday, September 13th, 1921. It&apos;s a stormy night, and the luxury ocean liner Lady Crithania is about to be capsized by an enormous wave. Many of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the sinking ship before it floods entirely. Will you?Inspired by Paul Gallico&apos;s 1969 novel The Poseidon Adventure, this game puts the player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher, architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell, doctor. Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct backstories and motivations -- a successful strategy toward winning the game will vary greatly depending on which character you initially select to play. And just how is the game won?Here&apos;s a hint: don&apos;t be on the ship when it goes down for the last time. Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its platform-game spiritual predecessors Prince of Persia and Flashback: exploring and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well as many of the gradiated permutations between -- thanks to dizzying Mode 7 abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable (and predictably inconvenient) intervals, granting access to some hitherto unreachable areas (those doors at floor level are of little use when you&apos;re on the ceiling!) while denying access to other portions of the ship you perhaps intended to go back through. You&apos;re going to need to recognize where you can and can&apos;t -- yet -- reach, and make a note to revisit when the pendulum swings the other way.You&apos;re not going to make it out on your own. A successful evacuation is going to require the assistance of other survivors. Supposing you can find ( -- and reach!) them, you&apos;re still going to have to safely lead them past obstacles and hazards (as the ship flip-flops on its way to Davy Jones&apos; Locker)... and as with all NPCs, they&apos;re slower and less agile than you, necessitating plotting out the simplest, safest course possible (... given the circumstances.) Which of the endings you conclude with will be determined by who you rescue and how many of them there are -- but I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll have your hands full the first few dozen play-throughs just staying alive and trying to figure out how to get to where you&apos;re supposed to be going.Did I mention there&apos;s a time limit of one measly hour? For once, it&apos;s your friend; since your injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of 5 minutes from the time remaining -- but no matter how safe and dry a hidey-hole you manage to find, when the countdown reaches zero, it&apos;s game over.Hope you packed a towel!</story>

    <story>You have been called by the Master to restore life to the Friel empire. The ruler, King Magridd, struck a deal with the evil Deathtoll - in exchange for the soul of one living being, Deathtoll will give him a piece of gold. Magridd&apos;s greed got the better of him, and, thinking of the millions of souls of every living creature around the world, readily agreed to the deal. But Magridd himself has since disappeared, and the the land is now devoid of life - instead only filled with Deathtoll&apos;s monstrous minions. Will you be able to save Friel&apos;s subjects from their horrible fate?Soul Blazer is an action RPG in the top-down style of The Legend of Zelda. Like Zelda, battles are not turn-based - the player directly attacks enemies and dodges them. As they progress, they also unlock special items which allows them to complete tasks for characters or access special areas (such as the Dream Rod, which transports you into someone&apos;s - or something&apos;s - dream). Unlike Zelda, the game has an experience meter, and the player levels up and becomes stronger as they defeat enemies. The game&apos;s unique hook is that there are Monster Lairs spread all over the land of Friel. When they destroy all the enemies in a lair, they don&apos;t come back, and when they step on the empty lair, it restores part of the game world, bringing back anything from plants, to animals, to people, to buildings and more. Each restored soul helps in some way - for example, the player can climb regrown ivy to reach new areas, reunite families by bringing back husband and wife, rebuild cities by restoring architects, and talk to characters to complete even more quests.The player&apos;s main goal is to find six Stones, which allow them to gain access to the World of Evil, where Deathtoll resides. These stones are guarded by key characters in different parts of the world, usually the rulers, who require the player to defeat a boss character to rescue them. While most of the game allows them to progress in a linear fashion, there are certain souls that can only be restored by killing monsters that can&apos;t be harmed with their earlier weapons. The player will need to find special weaponry and then backtrack to previous areas to rescue these souls. It&apos;s also advisable to revisit previous locations, as certain characters may have new sidequests to complete which can reward them with new items to make them even stronger.</story>

Naturally, Dexter cannot let this happen and sets out to stop Borf and rescue Kimberly.While following the same story as the Laserdisc conversions, the SNES version of Space Ace obviously lacks the long video sequences of the original, and also features different gameplay. Instead of only pushing the right button at the right moment, the player has complete control over Dexter. Most of the time, he will be busy jumping over chasms and dodging alien attacks, but occasionally, an &apos;energize&apos;-symbol will appear which, by pressing the correct button in time, will temporarily transform Dexter into his stronger alter ego and enable him to shoot at his enemies.Once he boards his space ship, Dexter has to find his way out of a labyrinthine seen from a top-down perspective, destroying obstacles with the ship&apos;s laser and avoiding collisions.In order to retain the atmosphere of the original, the SNES version features a large number of (short) death animations and the platformer levels always follow the exact same sequence, which results in a trial&amp;amp;amp;error-style gameplay somewhat similar to the original.</story>

    <story>Sparkster is a 2D side-scrolling platformer starring the eponymous hero who previously appeared in Rocket Knight Adventures. It is very different from the contemporary Genesis title Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from the first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics. In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship. At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.Sparkster is a rodent carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around, duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal motion, or a stationary attack.The game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay, with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels have a level boss along with a large number of mid-level bosses. The game supports a password system.</story>

    <story>Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies. The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills. The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases. Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death. A high score table is also included.An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.Base Raid - Akin to capture the flag. Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.The CD-ROM manual includes a Cyberpunk story, to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.</story>

    <story>On it&apos;s most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness. Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</story>

    <story>The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication: Communicate: with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy&apos;s torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well.</story>

    <story>Street Combat is a one-on-one 2D fighting game in which several martial artists, athletes and crime-fighters from all across the globe decide to compete against each other in a street fighting tournament for fame and glory.Single player mode allows you to choose between two versions of the hero character (Steven) and then takes you through 7 best 2-out-of-3 matches against a collection of different martial artists. A 2-player Vs mode allows you to freely select any of the characters without restrictions.Gameplay is similar to other one-on-one beat &apos;em ups, in which you control your characters movements and attacks in a scrolling 2D plane attempting to defeat your opponent with special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and avoid his attacks.</story>

    <story>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series.New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</story>

    <story>The original Street Fighter II is a famous fighting game. Players select from one of eight characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, Chun Li, Guile and Dhalsim to do battle with. They must then use their combat strengths to defeat the other seven fighters followed by four boss characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has their own reasons for wanting to win against the others.Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depending on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the button combination style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight suplex.Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on gameplay and fighting games specifically can not be understated. Street Fighter 2 is responsible for making popular several different elements.</story>

You have to find your way back and to save your girl from the grim reality of petrification...This emotional drama turns out to be a rather simple platform game. The short, linear levels are all timed, so you have to hurry up and not to get delayed by the many treasures you might find on your way. You will have a weapon, your old trusty boomerang, which you will be able to upgrade during the game. After a series on levels, you will be invited to a boss battle.

And not only this: it separated the ardent lovers again. After the winds stopped blowing, Tina found herself somewhere on a tropical coast. As for Master Higgins, he went to the king of Waku-Waku and, along with his main quest to save his brand new wife, got an assignment to save also a princess, whom the king was about to marry. Is there a connection between those two events?..No, this is not a detective/mystery game, but platform arcade action. What distinguish the game clearly not only from ordinary platformers, but also from the first Super Adventure Island, are its light role-playing and puzzle-solving flavors. You don&apos;t have a time limit, but huge levels with many secret sub-levels to find, puzzles to solve, and treasure chests to unlock. You also can have equipment, such as swords, shields, etc. By defeating enemies, you gain health items, money, etc. Your HP is measured by hearts, and it can increase during the game if you find appropriate items.

    <story>Conceived partly as an Olympics tie-in, and partly as a stop-gap for James Pond fans (the third platform title in the series (Operation Starfish) was in the process of being heavily delayed, eventually being released in 1994), this game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.Most events had some sort of twist to them, to make them fit the underwater theme, or the style of humour seen in the James Pond series. The 100-metre-splash is similar to joystick-waggling games of the 80s but also involves making timed jumps to hit seagulls. More unusual is Kipper Watching, which involves &apos;heading&apos; incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals. There&apos;s also gymnastics, unicycle-riding, and a hurdles race of sorts. The events can be played by up to 4 players.</story>

    <story>This is the second game in the Bomberman series for the Super Nintendo. This game is much like the first in gameplay but has new levels and a new story to play though.The graphics are slightly different from the first game but in general the game holds most of the same style as the first. There are a few new features such as colour coded bomb blasts and a few different powerups but other than that the second game is the same as the first.</story>

Again there are new levels and a new story but there are also a lot of new features.Super Bomberman 3 adds in 5 player support using a multitap and the extra controller slot.

Many new powerups were added in this game including the Kangaroo which in addition to giving a player and extra hit allowed them to have some extra ablity including jumping, laying rows of bombs, and high speed running.Players are also not limited to the traditional Bomberman. There is a wide selection of different characters that the player can choose from.</story>

Along the way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a dinosaur form called Big Kronk, find candies that change his size from tiny to huge, travel through transportation tubes, and find multiple bonus levels.Bonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!</story>

    <story>Super Pang is an adventure for one or two players that takes the player around the world, aiming to rid the planet of a terrible foe: seemingly innocuous-looking bubbles. The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player&apos;s character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.Players must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.Several power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.In addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.</story>

The villain is Count Dracula.Belmont has the classic Castlevania assortment of weapons (the famous whip, daggers, axes, fire bombs, boomerangs) at his disposal, and he gains strength and points by collecting various-sized hearts, coin purses, and pork chops. Like most Castlevania games, Super Castlevania IV is a 2D side-scrolling action game. However, it is 2D with more depth than ever before.

    <story>Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal&apos;s vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.But this time, cars aren&apos;t just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you&apos;ll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.Furthermore, as well as the criminal&apos;s damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal, they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you&apos;re hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you&apos;re out of time, the game ends.When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you&apos;ve done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game&apos;s speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.</story>

(In the fifth skill level, there is also a Flag Ship, and the game is lost if either one is destroyed.) Scenarios are laid on on a hexagonal grid, and each space has its own terrain type and can be occupied by one unit. You move your units around and attack enemy units in adjacent hexagons. There are also cities, airports, and shipyards, which you can occupy and use for your own purposes (ie. to repair a unit). Depending on the skill level or scenario you can also construct factories to produce additional units.</story>

    <story>Super Godzilla is a 16-bit Godzilla game where the player can take control of Toho&apos;s famous big green lizard as they rampage through Japan. The game is divided into two main gameplay modes, Movement and Battle. Movement has the player travel through the city using the D-pad and a map located on the bottom of the screen with the objective being to destroy certain objectives such as enemy humans and buildings as well as pick up power-ups. There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.Battle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster. However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks. Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.</story>

    <story>Super Mario RPG is a console RPG starring none other than Nintendo&apos;s popular character Mario. This game starts off like almost every other Mario game, with Bowser kidnapping Princess Toadstool. However, when Mario goes to Bowser&apos;s Keep to save her, a giant sword made by the evil Smithy crashes into the castle and sends Mario, the Princess, and Bowser flying to separate parts of the world.The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario and the members of his party gain experience points by defeating enemies. These experience points can increase the team&apos;s maximum number of hit points and flower points (magic points). The battles are also turn-based, but this time there are timed attacks and defenses. Timed attacks allow you to inflict more harm than normal to an enemy. Timed defenses, on the other hand, allow an enemy to inflict less harm than normal. You are only allowed to have three out of five team members on your party at a time. Mario is always in your party, regardless. Your team members can also purchase more weapons and abilities, along with better armor.</story>

    <story>Once again, the evil Bowser has captured Princess Peach (while on a holiday on Yoshi&apos;s Island), and it&apos;s up to Mario to save her. To aid him in his quest, Mario must use the flying ability of the feather to get him to places hard to reach. But what&apos;s even more important is his new friend, the dinosaur Yoshi, who Mario can ride through each level and eat the enemies.Over 90 levels are on offer, with plenty of Bowser&apos;s evil koopas and new characters around each level. Apart from saving Peach, you can also save some of Yoshi&apos;s friends, other dinosaurs that each have a special attack. Each level also contains a set of extra items to collect, including dinosaur coins, and break the tape at the end of each level to collect stars, that allow you to open up the bonus games.</story>

    <story>The events of Yoshi&apos;s Island take place in the past. Mario was one of two twin brothers whom the evil Magikoopa Kamek tried to kidnap. Kamek kidnapped one of the brothers, but the second, Mario, fell down on Yoshi&apos;s island, where Yoshis live. The Yoshis decided to carry baby Mario and to bring him to his parents. But Kamek has sent troops and hordes of monsters to stop the Yoshis and to kidnap Mario.In the game, players control the differently colored Yoshis most of the time. Mario is a helpless baby unless a star that makes him invincible is collected. As a Yoshi, players can swallow enemies to make eggs; these eggs are used for attacking other enemies and activating switches. Yoshi can do a flutter jump to clear large gaps that a regular jump can&apos;t. Players can also pound the ground for attacks and also flipping certain switches. Additionally, Yoshis can transform into vehicles, such as a helicopter, submarine, or a train. If Mario is dismounted from a Yoshi, a countdown will start, and Yoshi must catch the baby before Kamek&apos;s servants kidnap it. When Mario is invincible, he doesn&apos;t ride on Yoshi and is immune to attack. While invincible, Mario can run up certain walls.</story>

    <story>Super Metroid is a follow-up to Metroid II, and once again features bounty hunter Samus Aran. She heads to planet Zebes in order to hunt down the leaders of the Space Pirates, who kidnapped an unique Metroid larva. Super Metroid is a platform game, which, like the previous Metroid games, is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated with doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game. There are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus&apos;s standard laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus&apos; max health, and other gadgets (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling). There are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus&apos; increasing capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or ammo.</story>

    <story>Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due to a malfunction on Dr Krankenpot&apos;s new teleport machine (how come characters with German-sounding names in computer games and films are always evil or stupid? Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he&apos;s been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game&apos;s plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can&apos;t be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can&apos;t progress.</story>

    <story>One day a spaceship came down from the heavens and into the skies of Chinaland. It began broadcasting an image of peace. Soon Emperor Chin was holding a peace conference with the space ship&apos;s leader, Rub-A-Doc. Rub-A-Doc visited with some of the other places in the world before departing to the heavens and leaving the world. All seemed peaceful however there seems to be trouble starting up, strange monsters have been seen throughout Chinaland. Could the increase in monsters be somehow related to the recent visit from Rub-A-Doc? The ninja masters of Mount Edin, Jack and Ryu are sent to investigate...Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears.A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.As mentioned, this game is an RPG and contains familiar RPG elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling &apos;battle mode&apos; where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells... as well as activate various &apos;bonuses&apos; on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp;amp;amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills accuired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy&apos;s turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.</story>

    <story>Super Off Road: The Baja is a sequel of Super Off Road. Unlike its predecessor which uses an isometric top-down view of a single-screen track, this arcade racing game is made specifically for the SNES and uses its Mode 7 hardware for a 3D racing experience with a 3rd person perspective.The game has three different tournaments, the Mexico 250, Ensenada 500 and Baja 1000. Instead of having to drive many consecutive rounds on a small circuit the circuits are big and more akin to rally racing with a finish at a different location than the start. The game is still held with many opponents as well as non participating traffic and wildlife that can hinder the player or be ruthlessly run over. Along the bumpy off-road tracks the player can collect bags of money, just like in its predecessor. Money can be spend on improvements of various of the car&apos;s parts, such as: brakes, tires, shocks, lights, engine and nitros.</story>

    <story>Super Scope 6 is the pack-in game for the Super Scope peripheral, which is required to play this game. The emphasis of Super Scope 6&apos;s gameplay is on first person shooting, using the required Super Scope accessory to aim. It features a total of six game modes, categorized as either Blastris or LaserBlazer.Blastris Mode features a variety of unrelated games.1. Blastris A is a falling block game based on Tetris and plays very similar. Blocks appear on the left side of the screen and move towards the right side of the screen, where they will fit into play. The goal is to have the blocks on any column line up and destroy themselves. Each level requires five of these to happen. Unlike Tetris, the player cannot move or even rotate blocks. Instead each section of the block can be destroyed by shooting it. Higher difficulty levels increase the speed of gameplay2. Blastris B is a falling block game based on Columns and Puyo Puyo. On each screen are a number of jelly blocks which must be destroyed to complete the stage. New blocks appear at the top of the screen and move towards the bottom where they fit into play. Blocks can be destroyed by lining up a row of 4 blocks of the same colour. The player is unable to move the falling blocks but may cycle their colour by shooting at them.3. Mole Patrol is combination of Whack-a-Mole and a shooting gallery. A number of moles appear on the screen with a flag indicating the amount that need to be destroyed that level, before jumping into a pipe. From there the moles will climb out of any one of 12 holes on the screen and the player must shoot them as fast as possible. Along with regular moles are pink moles that will temporarily speed up gameplay, making shots more difficult.LazerBlazer Mode feature a group of games set in a military atmosphere.1. Type A: Intercept is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming missiles and airplanes. These missiles/planes appear on the right side of the screen and move towards the left side. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level.4. Type B: Engage is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming missiles and airplanes, which will cautiously open fire on the player. These missiles/planes appear in front of the player, in the distance and move towards the player. The player has limited energy which is decreased when hit by an enemy. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level. 5. Type C: Confront is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down incoming spacecraft, which will actively open fire on the player. These UFOs can appear anywhere on the screen and the player must shoot them down before they open fire on the player. Each hit by an enemy decreases the player&apos;s shield energy. A radar is also given to the player to keep track of overall positions of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each level.</story>

The world&apos;s most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game&apos;s frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</story>

    <story>This conversion of a Taito arcade game was released to coincide with the 1992 European Championships. The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op&apos;s close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.</story>

    <story>The sequel to Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are omitted or changed. As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game, mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field, and break through Cloud City&apos;s defenses in Luke&apos;s X-Wing fighter. The game&apos;s other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that restore Luke&apos;s Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon completion of each of the game&apos;s 25 stages.</story>

    <story>The story of this game is based on Episode IV: A New Hope, the first of the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie&apos;s main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.Most of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke, Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.Some of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting at enemies on the way.</story>

To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.</story>

    <story>Super Turrican is back, and once again the USS Freedom Forces have to prevent the evil Machine from harming innocent civilizations. This requires the player to jump and shoot his way through large levels filled with lots of enemies. To get rid of all the enemies, several different weapons can be used, most of which are already familiar to players from previous installments of the series: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to gointo wheel-mode for a limited time to become invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest difference to previous Turrican-games however, is the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of the levels are strictly linear and don&apos;t feature any large secret areas that have become somewhat of a trademark of the series.</story>

There are also special power ups in different categories - these allow Widget to transform into a variety of different creatures, each with their own different ranged attack. As the player collects more power-ups of the same type (up to three), they change into more powerful creatures. If the player gets hit while transformed, they change back to the previous creature. If they get hit while as normal Widget, they lose a life.At the end of each world is a boss character.

Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer.

Unable to resist their curiosity, the boys open the door, and Ark finds a box with a strange creature inside. By opening the box, Ark damages the balance between two co-existing worlds, and all the village people are turned into stones. Now Ark has to embark on a dangerous journey - to find five Towers, and to seek there the answers to his questions, and to liberate his people from a terrible curse.Terranigma is an action game with slight RPG elements. Ark levels up after having completed an important quest or cleared out an area.

    <story>Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or line without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you&apos;ll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.</story>

Only Yoshi has escaped its effects, and so he must set off to free his friends, and to defeat Bowser and break the spell.Tetris Attack is a fact-paced action puzzler featuring the colorful cast of characters from Yoshi&apos;s Island. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they&apos;ll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. The game is based on the Japan-only title Panel de Pon.</story>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park&apos;s allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don&apos;t let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</story>

    <story>Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film Timecop, this game acts as a sequel of sorts. We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the film, and challenges him to a duel across time. Platforming action follows across multiple periods of history.The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The timing,, both in terms of controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through the entire game.There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the FBI...

Stages are broken down into 4 parts. The first part is a training section where players can practice shooting. The next two parts are action scenes. In the action scenes, gameplay consists of moving a cross-hair over various enemies and shooting them. The final part ends the day with a showdown. The showdown involves a one on one duel in which a draw icon will randomly pop up anywhere on the screen which must be shot then immediately afterwards the enemy the player is facing then must also be shot. This continues on until either the player&apos;s or the enemy&apos;s life bar is drained.If a player doesn&apos;t shoot an energy canteen during a level a bonus screen will appear. The bonus screen shows a woman spinning around on a round board with stars next to her body. Shooting the stars without missing and without accidentally shooting the woman will help players pick up large amounts of money.At the end of a level the amount of money made is tallied up. For every bullet wasted and damage taken the player loses money. The player gains money equal to the their accuracy and the amount of energy they had left at the end of the stage.</story>

    <story>The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player&apos;s perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.</story>

    <story>You play Buster Bunny, in a series of levels, featuring characters from the Tiny Toon Adventures cartoon.Most of the six levels are platform levels, where Buster has a number of attacks to defeat the enemies he faces. These include kicks and jumps, and a dash ability that lets you slide into enemies to defeat them, and also climb walls.The fourth level is an exception, and consists of a game of (American) football, played with a simplified version of the rules. The idea is simply to get a touchdown, while as usual progressing at least ten yards in four downs. There are two plays: a running play, where you simply run as far as possible while avoiding the opposing team; and a passing play that starts with a pass that can gain you extra yards, but must be caught.Between levels there are bonus games. You spin a wheel to determine what game you play out of five available.</story>

After each fight is over, players go to the gym to train in various different exercises like skipping rope and bench pressing weights.

    <story>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin&apos;s earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</story>

These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens. Game play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.As there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.</story>

    <story>The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang is an action-rpg starring the titular hero, a young vampire prince who must rescue his parents and save the inhabitants of the Vladamasco Islands from the evil Von Hesler. But is it really his handiwork, or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel the mystery while traveling to various locales, fighting Von Hesler&apos;s henchmen and picking up (CPU-controlled) companions along the way.Spike McFang has three main methods of attack: by striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also heal his health or give his companions extra strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you&apos;re playing the sanitized North American version) to regain health. There are a total of four different hats that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, head-spinning plants and a plethora of other dangerous enemies.</story>

    <story>Side-scrolling shoot-em-up, in a similar style to such games as Gradius, R-Type and Scramble. The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of &apos;Area 88&apos;, in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios. You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm. The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine &apos;Seavet&apos; and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne &apos;bandits&apos; who swarm-in on Area 88. The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......</story>

Meanwhile, a new philosophical/social doctrine is spreading through Britannia, promoted by the mysterious Fellowship...The story of this version of Ultima VII is essentially the same as in the original PC version. However, the dialogues have been greatly reduced and/or simplified. This applies also to the size of the game&apos;s cities and other locations, the amount of items to pick up, interior details, etc.Combat also underwent significant changes. The battles in this version are action-based; the player has to click on the enemy repeatedly to win. Unlike the PC version with its party management, the Avatar is traveling and fighting solo in this release.</story>

    <story>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family&apos;s debt.4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It&apos;s up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player&apos;s flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.</story>

    <story>What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog with Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater?It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo&apos;s twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It&apos;s like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn&apos;t sound like much of a game at all...Here&apos;s the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers...</story>

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</story>

    <story>Vortex was one of the few games designed to use the SNES Super FX 1 chip, a custom-made graphics accelerator RISC processor. The game is a 3D shooter similar to Star Fox by the same development studio, but with some subtle differences. Players can morph their vehicle at any time from the standard walker to a sonic jet, a land burner and a defensive hard shell, each with their own weapons, strengths and weaknesses.The player is cast as a soldier fighting the Aki-Do Forces, an evil empire bent on taking over the entire universe. To stop them, the player has access to an experimental mech, the Vortex, to travel the seven worlds of the Aki-Do system and destroy the bases.</story>

    <story>In the year 2003 geneticists tried to create the perfect soldier. Something went wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies&apos; bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place.</story>

    <story>An alien race named Kyllen has enslaved humanity. On the planet Joyec, rebels managed to take the Kyllen by surprise and seize one of their battle fleets. The player must now guide their efforts in trying to throw over the Kyllen. War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn&apos;t destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.</story>

    <story>Wario&apos;s Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond&apos;s color.There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it&apos;s in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that&apos;s in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.There are 5 different modes of play: a Round Game in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a Time Race mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the computer, but the Round Game mode features two modes of play: one that includes boss-fights on every level ending with a 9.</story>

    <story>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</story>

You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming crosshair (at the same time). Select either Clint (yes, inspired by Mr. Eastwood) or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and jumping over incoming rockets.After the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train (you can play these levels in any order). Finally there&apos;s a showdown with the big bad guy. Each of the 6 levels is divided into 3 sublevels. The 3rd one is always a boss-battle. During the game your standard weapon can be temporarily upgraded by collecting power-ups. If you want to create some serious mayhem you can detonate one of your bombs. Almost any object in the background can be destroyed.Wild Guns has a two-player co-op mode. There&apos;s also a shooting gallery mode in which you can&apos;t die; this one is all about scoring as many points as possible.</story>

    <story>WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.</story>

    <story>The Confederation have been at war with the Kilrathi for the past 20 years, and you&apos;re just now joining the Vega campaign. You&apos;re a 2nd Lieutenant just out of the Academy, with some good work under your belt. You&apos;re posted to Tiger&apos;s Claw, the flagship of the Confederation Fleet. Will you help the Confederation to victory, or go down in infamy? Wing Commander is a space combat simulator interspersed with shipboard dialogs. Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. The 3D space combat have you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You&apos;ll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. When the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree have both winning and losing paths. Wing Commander featured a hybrid bitmap/3D graphics engine that allowed even 286&apos;s to display detailed 3D graphics to an extent never before possible. With EMS available, it can display even more detailed graphics and in-cockpit animations.</story>

    <story>The game takes place during World War 1. Choose one of the five allied fighter pilots to do battle against the Central Powers. The game consists of 20 missions with the final one culminating with a battle between the player and The Red Baron.Missions are basically the same as in its&apos; predecessor Wings. There are bombing missions where you have to take out targets that were circled in an aerial photograph, strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: dogfights in the sky.If a mission is completed successfully, the player can power up the successful pilot in four skill categories: flying, shooting, mechanics, and stamina. A failed mission can lead to either a dishonorable discharge or death for the pilot.</story>

    <story>The Wizard of Oz for the SNES is a re-telling of L. Frank Baum&apos;s classic story as strongly influenced by MGM&apos;s 1939 musical. To a lesser degree, individual levels adapt locations from the 1993 Wizard of Oz Animated Series by DIC by using settings from the series, such as Time Town.The game is a platform adventure, which highly encourages exploration. The action is split into four worlds. In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a companion the witch must be fought. After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different attacks and abilities. Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as Toto also.All levels can be revisited once passed and doing so required both for the purposes of stocking up on items and to find the Emerald City tickets which are required to enter the final area.</story>

    <story>id software&apos;s adaptation of their classic first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D to consoles is not a straight port, but a remix with substantial changes as well as new additions.While the basic gameplay of exploring levels, shooting enemies, collecting treasures, keys and power-ups remain the same, only half of the original game&apos;s 60 levels have been retained. Each of those 30 levels (grouped into six missions, with two levels being secret ones) is a simplified version of an original level. The end bosses for the missions are taken from both Wolf3D as well as its sequel, Spear of Destiny.Other changes from the original include new power-ups: an ammo box (taken from Spear of Destiny) and backpack that increases the maximum amount of ammo that can be carried.The original&apos;s weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun, chaingun) all return, but there are also two completely new tools of destruction: a flame thrower and a rocket launcher.</story>

Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. There&apos;s a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity).

Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter.

    <story>Because of a rise of anti-mutant activity in Genosha, Professor Xavier uses Cerebro to scan the island nation and discovers Apocalypse&apos;s presence there. Genosha&apos;s government is apparently using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate.X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains.Each character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit&apos;s Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison&apos;s Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations.While most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men. Progress is saved via password.</story>

    <story>Xardion tells the tale of 3 warring planets that are home to 3 distinct alien races. Their fighting is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a much more potent alien race. The 3 planets find that they are able to set aside their differences long enough to battle their shared menace.Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the threat. There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that one character receives a health refill.Each character has special attributes that help the team. For example, Panthera&apos;s relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the other 2 characters can not travel. The characters can gather a number of unique powerups and weapons to help them on their mission.</story>

    <story>Yoshi&apos;s Cookie is a fast-paced puzzle game that can be enjoyed by everyone as it is easy to play, but challenging to complete. To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The Yoshi cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</story>

There are bosses along the way that must be destroyed before players can move on to the next area. Game supports single or multi-player game modes.</story>

    <story>After trying to rescue a drowning young woman, the the hero of Young Merlin is drawn into a fantasy world which is threatened by the evil Shadow King. Naturally, it is your job to save this world and also to rescue the aforementioned woman who has been kidnapped by the Shadow King. This is done in typical action adventure fashion: you have to fight enemies using spells that are gathered during the progress of the game as well as solve puzzles and use several objects. What sets Young Merlin apart from other action adventures is the fact that there is no text in the entire game, instead, icons are used to represent conversations, furthermore, the game uses passwords,instead of a battery to record the players progress.</story>

Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.

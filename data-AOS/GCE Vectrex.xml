  <plot>Bedlam is a multi-directional shooter. The player controls a cannon in the center of the screen that can rotate 360°. Around the player is a star-shaped geometric form that changes from stage to stage. The corners of the star emit enemy ships that must be destroyed. The ships have different attack patterns, from ones that just travel in a straight line towards to ones which are indestructible and can only be pushed away from the player. If one of the enemy ships makes contact with the player, they will lose a life.Besides the fire button, the player can use a quick turn to better defend against opponents coming in from the other side and a &quot;zap,&quot; which destroys all ships on screen. Later levels feature stars with corners slowly moving towards the player (and thus with enemies spawning much closer) and rotating star shapes.</plot>

When you have collected all of the money, you will move on to the next level. A second game variation is available where the maze walls are invisible making it more difficult to navigate.</plot>

To win the game, the player has to get the ball into the opponents goal as often as possible within a certain time frame, while avoiding getting any balls into their own goal.Depending on whether the player&apos;s team has the ball, the control buttons change their functions. In offense, one button is used to pass/dribble while the other shoots the ball. When defending, one button can be used to cycle through currently available teammates. It is also possible to tackle the opponent currently having the ball in an attempt to separate them from it. The goalie is controlled by holding one button, and pushing the joystick up or down to slide the goalie along a vertical line in front of the goal.Due to the Vectrex only being able to display one colour, the two teams can only be discerned by their line brightness. When playing alone, the human player controls the brighter team. In a multiplayer match, player two controls the darker team.</plot>

Out for revenge after being humiliated by the high-school duo, Death kidnaps their &quot;medieval babe&quot; girlfriends from the first film, and drags them throughout history. Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band&apos;s latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.&amp;#xA;Playing as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor. Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin&apos; guitar solo. If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint.&amp;#xA;Other items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series&apos; interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future. Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that &quot;they&quot; left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game&apos;s puzzles.&amp;#xA;A password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player&apos;s progress.</plot>

  <plot>Hard Drivin&apos; is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass...&amp;#xA;The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on.&amp;#xA;Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is &quot;reset&quot; and you get up to speed again.&amp;#xA;The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</plot>

It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical &quot;wave&quot; attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.&amp;#xA;The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version.

  <plot>Power Factor is an action-platformer starring the single campily-named hero, Redd Ace, fighting alien creatures known as the Ceegarians from the Ceeg dimension. Of course, aliens being played out, the Ceegarians are actually referred to as &quot;transdimensional intruders,&quot; and the Ceegarian creatures the player faces off against are referred to as evil invading &quot;Sinlendo Techmods.&amp;#xA;The primary goal of the game is to work through stages and bosses essentially to build a bomb to destroy the Ceegarians. Pertaining to the bomb, there are six components. The entire game takes place within, as the box refers to it, &quot;our dimension&apos;s reactor. As such, the environments of the game are aimed to look like the inside of a machine. To further convolute the storyline, the instruction manual actually refers to the game itself as a Virtual Reality simulation the player is experiencing in the future, based on the exploits of Redd Ace, and you&apos;re meandering through this simulator on the &quot;famous Atarian Leisure Moon.&amp;#xA;Stages are fairly small, but designed like a maze à la Metroid. However, unlike Metroid, completed areas cannot be revisited. Each stage ends with a boss battle showcasing enemy characters that are often two screens high.&amp;#xA;Redd Ace is armed with a multi-use weapon known as the &quot;Tmat MOW. Tmat MOW is intended to be short for &quot;TRANSMAT Multi-Ordinance Weapon. Four different weapons may be acquired and used for both the A and B buttons, with eight total weapons in the game, and one gun as a standard. Other weapons include lasers, a flame thrower, missiles, bombs, and the like. Weapons must be picked up through playing the stages and collecting various weapon icons. Once the ammunition is used, the weapon is gone and must be recollected. As such, weapon pick-ups must be used sparingly, especially since most contain very small numbers of ammunition, often as low as two shots. Choosing weapons is awkwardly assigned to the Directional-pad, which is also where character movement is assigned. Tapping the D-pad allows the player to select different weapons, while holding it down moves Redd.&amp;#xA;Controlling Redd Ace is somewhat different from a typical platformer of the era. There is no jump button, as both the A and B buttons have weapons assigned to them. Instead, our hero is also armed with a levitation pack on his back, which allows flight. Tapping &quot;up&quot; on the D-Pad allows Redd to jump, while holding &quot;up&quot; activates the levitator and allows Redd to fly. Aside from a health bar, there is also a fuel bar showing that flight isn&apos;t a luxury to be wasted. When crouching, Redd automatically aims upwards at a 45-degree angle, rather than straight ahead.&amp;#xA;Pressing the &quot;Option 2&quot; button allows the player to see a menu with information about the bomb pieces the player is collecting, as well as details on the various weapons. If the player is standing in front of a computer monitor when Option 2 is pressed, the menu shows a map of the current area, and information on enemy characters.&amp;#xA;The player starts with three lives, and there are no continues. There are, however, three difficulty modes--Easy, Normal, and Hard—which may be selected prior to gameplay.</plot>

  <plot>Set in the 31st Century, this game begins when the President of the World has died at age 281 after being in power for 200 years. The United World Federation is in chaos. After nearly four centuries of the World Party being in control, the International Party is inclined to take over. Rumors regarding the President&apos;s death not being accidental are unconfirmed, but the World Party is still going on the defensive. Conventional warfare has been relegated to the obsolete and uncivilized past so the two parties are to settle the dispute the new, modern way, Robo-Squash.Robo-Squash is a game in which the player must catch as many balls in rows or columns as possible to win. An alternative way to win is to be the first player to hit the mechanical spider. As a round continues longer and longer, the balls will increase in speed, making the round progressively harder. Points can be collected by hitting bricks, special items, and the spider. When one of the players loses three balls or hits the mechanical spider, the round is over.If the player wins, the World Party will remain in power. If the player loses the International Party will win and divide the world into separate countries surely resulting in the same petty fighting that almost destroyed civilization in the 21st Century.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg. It&apos;s 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.&amp;#xA;There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.&amp;#xA;Along the way you&apos;ll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.&amp;#xA;Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</plot>

  <plot>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man&apos;s body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.&amp;#xA;As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.&amp;#xA;Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the &quot;very challenging&quot; and the &quot;impossible&quot;. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</plot>

Earth is attacked by evil aliens so the player is the last hope of the human race. He has to destroy numerous waves of aliens, dodging quickly to avoid collisions and enemy shots. Gameplay is simple: D-Pad is used to move up/down left/right and any button is used to shoot. The speed is not controllable. The aerial phase looks like the classic Afterburner but in a first person view. The player can dive whenever he wants. Sometimes headquarters will order the player to dive and it means the player is near a gem pod were he can collect diamonds. Near gem pods there is always a supply depot where bonuses (powerful shots, tracking missiles...) can be bought with the collected diamonds. Underwater the player moves a bit slower, and there are obstacles to avoid (like sunken antic temple columns).In the two player mode, the winner of a level is the one who has the higher score in this level.</plot>

  <plot>Zarlor Mercenary is a vertically scrolling shooter in which players takes the role of a mercenary group. The scenario is a long-time war between the Mendicant and Zarlor races and the mercenaries are hired by the Zarlors to clear out six levels hold by Mendicants. The basic gameplay consists of using a space ship to kill all enemy opposition on the way to the level end. Getting hit by their attacks lowers the health bar which leads to a life loss when completely gone. On the other hand, every killed enemy or destroyed building gives money which can be used between levels to buy upgrades like mega bombs (damages all enemies on the screen), a back cannon, extra lives or a powerful shield. While the direction is always vertically, the screen can be slightly scrolled left and right. Up to four players can participate in co-op gameplay; the difficulty is only effected by starting out with less lives. Then there are also two additional upgrades to buy: invisibility to hide from other players and back stabber which damages the other players instead of the enemies.</plot>

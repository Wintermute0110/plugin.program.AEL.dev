  <plot>A &quot;James Bond&quot; action/arcade game based on the movie with the same name. Your aim is to avenge the death of Felix Leiter, who was killed by the drug baron Sanchez.&amp;#xA;Technically the game consists of several different vertical scrolling action sequences. In each stage you must fly, drive or walk through a preset terrain. While doing that, you have to shoot enemies, avoid their shots and collect items (mainly ammunition). Some levels rely more on shooting, while others test your reflexes.</plot>

  <plot>Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game&apos;s earliest recreations. The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard&apos;s system. Three skill levels are provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.</plot>

  <plot>The sequel to 1942, which is still a vertically scrolling shooter, has the player once again fighting over the clouds during the second world war, this time in an intense battle just off the coast of Midway islands.&amp;#xA;Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.</plot>

  <plot>1st Division Manager is a football management game where you take on a team of your choice in any of the top four English leagues. On the main menu there are four icons as well as some major information such as your name, the name of your club, your current league position, a rating and the account balance. The first icon from left is the picture of a computer and by clicking on it you will get to the main database menu where you can handle the players&apos; training, studying the coming fixtures and edit the teams or players. The second icon is a telephone. Press it and you will be able to make a phone call to either the Transfer Market (for buying and selling players) or the the Bank (to get a loan). The third icon is a note book and by clicking on it you will see tables from all four divisions. The last icon is the picture of a football pitch and by pressing it you will get to your next match. After choosing your squad you will see the highlights of the match from a top-down perspective. After match you will get reports about players being injured, results in the other matches and the finances for that week.</plot>

  <plot>Most football management games written for 64K/48K computers concentrated their memory space on providing as many features as possible for a lone player. As the title implies, this game is an exception - 2 players each take control of a club, taking it in turns to make their managerial decisions and play their matches. For an extra competitive edge, they can include their own name among the players (which are otherwise made up of the real players of the day).&amp;#xA;The game uses a fictional 20-team superleague, with English and Scottish clubs, as well as a knock-out cup. You can buy or sell players, who have ability ratings out of 15, and swap your squad of 19 around to choose 11 starters plus 2 substitutes. Match scores are listed along with goalscorers, although the scorers update more quickly than the scores. You are kept up to date with financial changes after each match.</plot>

  <plot>The Outsiders have attacked the Earth Federation, laying waste to its defense fleets. In desperation, Federation Command sends the new Starstrike space fighters to attack the Outsiders&apos;s main bases (which are converted moons), hoping to exploit a fatal flaw in the design: a direct hit to the reactor at the center of the base might lead to its destruction.&amp;#xA;Both regarding graphics and gameplay, 3D Starstrike is essentially a clone of Atari&apos;s Star Wars. Using wireframe graphics with a first-person perspective, the player controls the Starstrike fighter in several distinct phases: the first phase is the approach to the enemy base, where Outsider space fighters must be destroyed. The second phase takes place close to the surface of the base, where enemy bunkers and laser towers await. The third phase is a trench run, where gun turrets await at the side of the trench, and catwalks blocking the way must be dogded. The run culminates in the reactor room, where two reactor pods must be hit to destroy the base.&amp;#xA;After a base is destroyed, the game continues with a new base in the next level, with later levels having a higher difficulty.</plot>

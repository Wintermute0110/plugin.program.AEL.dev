Should a marine be drained of health, he or she is not killed, but captured. Another character can attempt a rescue and is given 200 seconds.

  <plot>Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a journey from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is to find Obelix&apos;s lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.&amp;#xA;This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the &quot;Instant Fun&quot; option. They vary from a &quot;Memory&quot; style shield-matching game to humorous events such as &quot;Throw a Roman Mini Game&quot;.&amp;#xA;Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).</plot>

  <plot>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it&apos;s later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn&apos;t offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.&amp;#xA;To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump &apos;n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.&amp;#xA;There&apos;s an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</plot>

Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you&apos;ve got Activision&apos;s Asteroids remake.&amp;#xA;You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation. Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris. The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features. Each zone has 15 levels. In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back! And there&apos;s plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.&amp;#xA;There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are also three skill levels. If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship. All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace. There are also limited power-ups you can pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.&amp;#xA;The game supports either one or two players. In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level. You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways...&amp;#xA;Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you&apos;ll find the option of &amp;quot;Classic Asteroids&amp;quot; now appearing on the main menu.</plot>

In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.&amp;#xA;Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel. While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, &quot;that&apos;ll do, pig.</plot>

However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.&amp;#xA;Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player&apos;s success results in additional balls on the other player&apos;s screen which they then must clear.</plot>

Those mini games can be tackled in any order and when all in a category (fishing or hunting) are finished, the player gets access to the main assignment. This plays out with another, slightly more complex mini game. All this has to be repeated five times with increasing difficulty in order to beat the game.</plot>

  <plot>Motorized carnage. Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race? Now&apos;s your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the &apos;90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).&amp;#xA;At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents&apos; cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.&amp;#xA;Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.</plot>

  <plot>Dragon Dance is a Breakout variant with power ups similar to Arkanoid. Like in those games the objective is to destroy bricks with the use of a ball but with the difference that the paddle used to do so here is a dragon which when still curls up in a ball. For every ball that the player loses the dragon will shrink until there is nothing left of it. There is also a time limit for every level so the player can not take too long. Therefore it&apos;s possible to increase the speed level of the ball but there is no way to decrease it except by losing a ball (and restarting with a new one) or by getting a specific power up. Other power ups include those that add extra time or increase the dragon&apos;s movement speed. The player can also transform his dragon into other types of dragons that have special abilities. These become available as the player destroys bricks and is represented by a power gauge at the top of the screen. These abilities include freezing time, deflecting the ball in mid-air, shooting fireballs that destroy bricks and a web that can block off certain paths through the level. Random events featuring dragon gods can happen and will lead to different effects such as earthquakes or restored health. The game consists of one hundred levels with every tenth being a boss level. There is also a versus mode where two players can link up against each other. The players choose one of ten levels and compete in trying to clear the most bricks. For every five seconds the player with the least bricks cleared during that time gets an extra row of bricks added. The one that clears his screen first will win. </plot>

  <plot>Dragon Warrior III is the concluding game of the first Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior trilogy, and its story takes us back to the time period of the legendary Erdrick (also known as Loto), the ancestor of the first game&apos;s hero. You are the son of a powerful warrior Ortega, skillful in physical combat and spellcasting. Your father went out to fight the evil Baramos, who is responsible for the appearance of monsters in your region, and never returned. You are sent by the king on a quest to continue your father&apos;s brave deeds and to defeat Baramos.&amp;#xA;Dragon Warrior III is a top-down role-playing game where you travel around the overworld, caves, castles, cities and other locations while battling random encounters, buying equipment, and talking to people. You and your party members receive experience when they beat up monsters and level up with enough experience, increasing their stats. The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night.&amp;#xA;You begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.&amp;#xA;The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters&apos; classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.</plot>

Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.&amp;#xA;Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player&apos;s wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.&amp;#xA;The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</plot>

  <plot>Harvest Moon 2 GBC is a farming simulation game and the sequel to Harvest Moon GB. The mayor gives the player a free farm. However, the player must become a successful farmer, as the mayor will come to check on the player at the end of the year. If the farm is successful, he allows the play to keep farming a few more years. If not, he gives the player a second chance, because if they don&apos;t get their act together, he&apos;ll reclaim the land and develop it into an amusement park. The player chooses to play as either a boy or a girl, and then chooses if they want a dog or a cat as a pet (the pet choice slightly effects gameplay). The dog keeps other dogs from invading your farm at night, and the cat will occasionally bring items to the player&apos;s house. Livestock includes cows (for milk), chickens (for eggs) and sheep (for wool). A horse may also be eventually obtained for riding and work. The player&apos;s income primarily comes from crops. They are raised from seeds and must be watered every day until the harvest. The player can then sell them. Sometimes plants will produce more than one harvest. Crops can be grown all year long, but a greenhouse must be built in order to grow flowers and herbs during all seasons. Tools can be used to help with work, and include axes, hoes, hammers, watering cans, sickles, fishing rods, pickaxes and umbrellas. Unlike the previous game, there is no dating/romance feature.</plot>

Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.&amp;#xA;Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon. The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece. Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played. In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)&amp;#xA;In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.</plot>

Both are weaker in attacking, but are faster and can be used to transverse past traps and deactivate them to let Gadget past or solve puzzles in mini-game form in order to advance to the next area.&amp;#xA;Additionally, players can find power-ups such as muffins which will restore health and GG symbols, obtaining 20 of these symbols will give an extra life. Also MAD symbols will give Gadget three extra lives.

The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.&amp;#xA;The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.&amp;#xA;While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</plot>

Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in the middle row obviously takes and deals average damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, but you can only let 3 characters attack during a turn; One from each vertical row.&amp;#xA;The 3x3 system is also used for special attacks and magic systems. Each character has a power in one colour; Blue, green, yellow or red, which means magic, defense, speed or power respectively. The other characters who are in the same vertical or horizontal row also receive the same amount of power from this character; This way, all characters share their power with eachother.&amp;#xA;Other than that, the story circles around the Sinistrals returning - Again.

  <plot>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you&apos;re racing against the clock.</plot>

  <plot>Mario Golf on Game Boy Color isn&apos;t a straight port of the N64 game - it&apos;s a totally different game in its own right. It is a combination of a golf game and an RPG. As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning, with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can create will play in exactly the same way.&amp;#xA;Although the story mode is the main part of the game, there&apos;s quite a few other modes to keep you busy, like Tournament, Match Game, Stroke, Training, and the two-player mode via link cable. It comes with a dictionary of all the golf terms you&apos;ll need, and an extensive range of statistics on your player.</plot>

  <plot>Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Color is a much different experience than its N64 effort. In addition to the core gameplay found in the N64 version, the GBC version features an RPG-style world that allows you to work your way up through the ranks at the Royal Tennis Academy.&amp;#xA;The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as a Rookie with low stats. By completing training programs and defeating other students, you&apos;re able to gain experience points, which allow you to boost your tennis stats. When you&apos;re not playing tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy grounds: talking to other students, or just taking in the sights and sounds.&amp;#xA;In addition to the main game, there&apos;s also an exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for quick-play. And, if you get tired of playing the computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable for play against a friend.</plot>

Another mode is Professor Von Drake&apos;s &apos;Driving School&apos;. In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving. The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal). However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.&amp;#xA;Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color&apos;s functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey&apos;s Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey&apos;s Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.

  <plot>Micro Maniacs Racing is a racing game in the Micro Machines series. This time however, you don&apos;t get to race cars, boats or any other type of vehicle, but micro men. Most courses are on foot, but others allow you to take small vehicles such as jet skis and skate boards.&amp;#xA;The game offers a variety of micro men to play with, ranging from mutants, cyborgs, mad professors, experiments gone wrong, and other strange characters. They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. There are 32 races which are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.&amp;#xA;The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.</plot>

  <plot>6 Puzzle Games designed by Alexey Pajitnov, the original Tetris designer, on one Gameboy Color cartdridge.&amp;#xA;Jewel Chase. A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be &apos;stolen&apos; for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor &apos;bridge&apos; stone is used. 99 levels total.&amp;#xA;Spring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.&amp;#xA;Lineup. Using &apos;Tetris&apos; style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.&amp;#xA;Finty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.&amp;#xA;Color Collison. A &apos;Qix&apos; style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets &apos;reflected&apos; into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time.&amp;#xA;The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.&amp;#xA;Rat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations (&apos;hands&apos;) of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.</plot>

  <plot>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling.&amp;#xA;Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.&amp;#xA;In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can &apos;date&apos; your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend&apos;s monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom.&amp;#xA;During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO&apos;ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.</plot>

  <plot>Montezuma&apos;s Return is, in contrast to to the PC game of the same name, not a completely new adventure but closely based on the design of the original Montezuma&apos;s Revenge. While some of the 150 levels are directly ported over, the majority are new. Another major difference is that the camera is closer to the action, i.e. the levels scroll instead of fitting into a single screen.The premise is the same as always: The player takes the role of an adventurer who explores a pyramid in order to steal all its treasures. In each level, the goal is to grab all treasures and reach the exit without dying, which happens instantly when touching one of the numerous enemies or falling from too large a height. Since the player has no attack option besides rarely found daggers, the majority of the game is spent dodging by using ladders or jumping. Other obstacles besides enemies are closed doors which have to be opened with keys, conveyor belts, teleporters, disappearing platforms or the time limit. Power ups grant temporary advantages such as the ability to walk through enemies or kill them by touch.</plot>

Somehow the time machine breaks down, and sends the friends to unexpectedly different time locations. Now it&apos;s up to their friends - Animal and Kermit - to go to these locations and bring them back home. Jim Henson&apos;s Muppets is an arcade game based on the TV program The Muppets Show. Players control either Animal or Kermit to different time locations which hold their friends. There are a total of 6 locations. Players can freely choose the location they want to play. Each location contains 3 selectable levels and an unlockable level (can only be played after finishing the selectable levels). The selectable levels have the same objective: find your way to the goal. The unlockable is where you encounter with a boss and save your friend. Animal fights using his drum sticks, while Kermit throws paper planes at enemies. Enemies (except the bosses) cannot identify the players&apos; character, therefore don&apos;t fight at all. They simply just move from side to side. There are some items that aid players during the game: food (increase health), heart (give players one life), drum sticks (when playing as Animal)/paper planes (when playing as Kermit). Pressing a combination of button can enable Animal and Kermit to use special moves: Animal&apos;s earthquake and Kermit&apos;s super high jump. The graphics are in 2D. Players can save their process by choosing &quot;Save&quot; in the level choosing menu. At the beginning of a level or when players die, Statler and Waldorf will present exchanging a short conversation about the level.</plot>

  <plot>NYR: New York Race for the Game Boy Color is a futuristic racing game inspired by the 1997 French film The Fifth Element. Unlike the version for console and PC, the handheld presents the races in a top-down view with less features and options. The game consists of several divisions of 2 tracks each. Only the first division is available from the start, others are unlocked by placing first in all races of earlier ones. At the beginning, only the taxi (as driven by Bruce Willis&apos; character in the film) can be used. Further cars must be purchased with money won in the races (by placing first, second or third). Eight different cars are available to buy, differing in ratings for power, traction and shield strength. The more powerful cars can only be bought upon reaching higher divisions. Progress through the game is stored via passwords. Races are against three opponents, take place on circular courses and consist of four laps. The futuristic hovercars have the ability to change altitude, either driving on the ground or high in the air. Flying high is necessary for maximum speed, but there are obstacles on the track that can only be passed by driving under them. There are also power-ups that can only be picked up when on the ground. These include missiles, shields, speed boosts, slowdown bubbles and short-time invulnerability. An arrow is always in view and points out corners and, when in high altitude, obstacles.</plot>

It&apos;s a bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.&amp;#xA;In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don&apos;t want to play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also supports multiple players.</plot>

Now, a long time after these events, the gems came into the possession of twelve mysterious characters. Each one of them tries to get a hold of the remaining jewels to fulfill their dreams - some of them seek peace while others want to satisfy their hunger for power. Puchi Carat takes its inspiration from the video game classic Breakout. The player has to clear rows of gems with a ball launched from a cursor that can only move horizontally on the bottom of the screen. In regular intervals, the stones will move one row towards the bottom. Once they reach a line just above the cursor, the game is over.

  <plot>Puzzle Master is a falling block puzzle game similar to Columns or Puyo Puyo. It is fantasy themed and the blocks here represents the four elements (water, fire, wood and rock) that have been corrupted by an evil goblin king. As these fall from the sky it&apos;s the player&apos;s job to arrange them so that a cluster of three or more elements of the same type is created. These elements will then be cleared from the playing field. When the player succeeds with doing this his Power Sword gets charged and when it&apos;s fully powered the level is completed. The player fails if the stack of elements reaches the top of the screen. But there are more challenges as some levels have monsters that throw indestructible skull blocks that quickly fills up the playing field. To combat these monsters the player has access to a limited supply of adventurer&apos;s tools. Some of these, like daggers and bombs, do direct damage on the target that it&apos;s dropped on but can also be used to help clearing the elements. Daggers will take out an entire column of elements while hearts act as a wildcard and potions remove all elements of a sort from the playing field. There are also keys that can be used to unlock chests or get access to new areas of the playing field. Some special puzzles exist too for the player to figure out. For example dropping a water element on a flower will give an extra tool. The game three modes: quest, time challenge and training. There are more than fifty levels split over five different realms. The fifth realms is only made available if the player succeeds in completing the first four and collects all the ancient objects.</plot>

If the player reaches the exit with all mission objectives complete, the next level is introduced by a password. Playtime per level is up to 20 minutes and there are 150 levels.

However, the whole screen is filled with dirt which is removed by simply walking into it; clearing a walking path for the monsters with the deadly touch. Brian&apos;s main weapon is his magic staff which shoots a powerful blast, but needs to recharge for a while before it can be used again. An alternative weapon are the chests which stand around the levels and are subject to gravity: digging the dirt under it causes it to fall down. A chest to the head is unhealthy for both Brian and his enemies. There are also power-ups to collect, e.g. higher speed or more firepower.</plot>

  <plot>Rhino has eaten one too many peppers, and now his mouth is burning with flame. The only way to stop it is to find the magical waterfall, but creatures litter the path between the jungle party and the waterfall, so you must run, jump and stomp your way very carefully. 7 worlds split into 19 levels are on offer, each with a varying amount of creatures waiting to stop you from getting to your goal, but by using Rhino&apos;s newly added fire breath as well as his belly flop, most enemies shouldn&apos;t be a problem for you.</plot>

  <plot>Rip-Tide Racer is a futuristic racing-game set in a flooded world. The player can choose between three armed hover bikes which differ in speed and armor. There are two playing modes available:&amp;#xA;Time Trial is basically the campaign mode in which the player participates in overall eight races on the eight courses the game has to offer. The four opponents can shoot at each other and the goal is to finish the race first. In this mode a password is rewarded after every victory. The round courses sometimes allow alternate paths.&amp;#xA;Deathmatch focuses on the shooting part. The opponents (the number can be set beforehand) move freely over the course (without the boundaries from time trial) and the last one standing wins. There are also some power ups to collect. </plot>

  <plot>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.&amp;#xA;By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.&amp;#xA;Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</plot>

The player starts with one Robopon, named Sunny, and must travel Porombo island as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon Collectors. The collectors primarily played against are known as the &quot;Legend 7&quot;, who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island. When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank. To improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks. Ultimately, Robopon plays a lot like Pokémon. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and healed in their machine. One thing where Robopron differs from Pokémon is that in battle, a defeated Robopon sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks for the player&apos;s birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player will start with.</plot>

The player takes the role of Nick Logan who has the unique ability to see through alien disguises and accompanies him during his work: catching aliens to save the world. The gameplay principle is simple: the player walks through 15 levels with a fixed camera perspective and shoots everything he sees, e.g. werewolves or vampires. To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn&apos;t kill his enemies for good: He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate. Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock: basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing. The levels are divided into five areas: London, Ireland, San Francisco, a Maya temple and Roswell.</plot>

Sabrina Spooked is aimed at 6 to 9 year olds, so the basic story line is straightforward: Sabrina and her faithful cat Salem follow their aunts through a magic portal; there they discover that the Spooky Man--a baddie, of course--has kidnapped them in order to steal their magic powers, along with those of the world&apos;s other witches and wizards. Sabrina sets out to foil the Spooky Man&apos;s plan, using a range of spells across four different gaming worlds. The game takes a platform format--you move around and over obstacles, knocking out the enemy on the way. Zapping presents is a good idea, as this reveals goodies such as extra health, spells, and lives. Each level has an exit portal that&apos;s only opened when you&apos;ve found three crystals. When Sabrina gets to a portal she has to survive a trap set by the Spooky Man. There are no shortcuts to getting this job done. You can switch between controlling Sabrina or Salem. Salem is quite small, making him very useful for getting through tiny spaces--but he can&apos;t defeat enemies, so you need to think carefully about when best to use him. </plot>

  <plot>Until now, Scrabble has generally been reserved for days when you&apos;re stuck inside during the British summer holidays when it&apos;s raining. But the little game with the letter tiles has made it onto the Game Boy, so now you can have all of that scrabbly goodness in the palm of your hand. As well as the standard game--where you get some letters, make spellings up and then shout &quot;what do you mean there&apos;s no such word as QXZYJHD?&quot;, there is also a conundrum round where you and your opponents get the same seven letters and have to arrange them into a word. You can play against up to three other players (either computer players or friends--although you&apos;ll all have to use the same machine as the game doesn&apos;t make use of the link cable). If you play against the computer you can choose a difficulty level--Novice, Easy, or Hard--and the pictorial representation of the opponent changes depending on which level you play, from a man with a dunce&apos;s hat to the expert who looks like Einstein. It&apos;s a nice touch which gives you the impression of playing against someone rather than just the computer AI. There are also various options you can choose to spice up play: you can set &quot;word challenge&quot; to on so that your opponent can dispute a word you put down (otherwise the dictionary will do it automatically when you place your tiles; the intelligence of this changes as you go up difficulty levels), and you can also turn off the &quot;miss a turn&quot; function when you get a word wrong. It&apos;s very simple to pick up and play, and the board is reproduced in the original colours. Basically, this is a very addictive game for people of all ages.</plot>

  <plot>Infiltrate the lair of the elusive Shadow, shoot and sneak your way through his army of robotic minions, and hunt him down before he does the same to you. Starring in the titular role of Shamus, you will have to find your way through over 120 rooms in this cross between Berzerk&apos;s &quot;robots in a maze&quot; action and Adventure&apos;s exploration of a predefined game world. The elusive villain&apos;s henchmen will express their disapproval of your plans in rather strong terms, namely with showers of bullets. What&apos;s more, once they&apos;re dead they don&apos;t necessarily stay that way: each time a room is re-entered, a random selection of them will respawn. The Shadow has also arranged for electrified walls throughout his compound, so bumping into them will prove quite lethal. The labyrinth of chambers is divided into four levels, with multiple locked doors that&apos;ll have you wandering around in search of the right keys. If you tarry too long in the same room, a bulletproof Shadow (taking a page from Evil Otto&apos;s book) will drop by to discourage loitering.</plot>

  <plot>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to &quot;the Tank. The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!&amp;#xA;Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.&amp;#xA;You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You&apos;ll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you&apos;ll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you&apos;ll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</plot>

Of course humanity sends squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth. The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels.

  <plot>Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There are four different game variations included. The first is &apos;Breakout&apos;, and plays the same as the original game. This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In &apos;Progressive&apos; the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there&apos;s room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. The other two games add a second paddle. In &apos;Double Breakout&apos; you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In &apos;Cavity&apos; there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed. </plot>

  <plot>When on a pleasure cruise for his tenth birthday, a young boy is swept castaway to a remote island by a fierce storm that destroys the entire ship. With no family or friends, he must fend for himself on this strange, seemingly uninhabited island and ultimately find a way to return home.&amp;#xA;Survival Kids is presented in an overhead action-RPG style similar to Link&apos;s Awakening. Players must try to survive through each day by getting enough rest, eating food and drinking water regularly. This can be risky, as certain foods such as mushrooms can have varying effects including paralysis and poison, while other foods can go rotten and make you sick if you eat it.&amp;#xA;The game also features a unique &quot;merge&quot; system, which allows you to create a number of different items by combining two other items. For example, combining bark and a stick would produce kindling, while using ivy with a bent stick could create a bow. There are plenty of useless items that can be made in addition to the essentials, so it&apos;s up to the player to think as to what could be helpful in their quest to survive.</plot>

It offers eight licensed off-road trucks from manufacturers like Jeep, Dodge, Ford and Subaru and seven international areas to race in, each with three different tracks. Further cars and tracks are available as hidden bonuses. Races are seen from a top-down perspective. The modes are similar to those in the developer&apos;s earlier Test Drive 6. The main gameplay mode is Tournament Mode. Seven different cups are available that have to be taken on in order, unlocking tracks in the process. Winnings from races can be spent to purchase new cars. After every race, power up points are awarded that can be used to improve the car in acceleration, top speed, traction and gearing. It is also possible to equip the car with a GPS, which provides a map of the track during a race, and with further enhancements, the locations of all drivers. Also available are power bursts and power winches. Bursts give a short speed burst, while winches can be used to quickly reset the car to a checkpoint if it becomes stuck at an obstacle like mud or water. Single Race mode allow players to race on unlocked tracks with their purchased cars. In Patrol Chase mode, players can select from special cop variants of three different cars, with the goal being chasing down the other cars on the track and giving them tickets by ramming into them. The game cartridge has a rumble feature that lets players experience all the bumps and rough terrain first-hand.</plot>

The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.&amp;#xA;The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player&apos;s perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.</plot>

  <plot>The Game Boy Color version of the original Tom Clancy&apos;s Rainbow Six game scales back the 3D visuals of the original game in favor of an almost top-down view, but builds on the same premise of the player controlling a member of the Rainbow counterterrorism unit, responsible for resolving hostage situations and neutralizing threats, in sixteen missions.&amp;#xA;The limitations of the platform are not traded in for an arcade-like approach. Just like the major computer version it stresses careful planning and tactics. After a briefing that needs to be followed attentively, the player assumes the role of the commander and assembles a squad of eight operatives, each with different statistics and abilities, based on character traits such as aggression and self-control, physical elements such as stamina, and specific skills including stealth, firearms, electronics, demolitions and many other types of weapons. They can be divided into up to four independent teams. Next, the operatives are outfitted with a selection of six different rifles, six different handguns, 24 types of armor or camouflage and additional tools including heartbeat sensors and door charges. Default equipment is suggested right away, but that is not sufficient for later missions. In the planning mode, the last part of the pre-mission activities, the commander needs to set out waypoints on the map and determine the course of action.&amp;#xA;The actual missions are shown in 2D where the different characters can sneak around, blow up doors, rescue hostages and engage the enemy, all requiring a tactical approach. The general plot points and mission objectives are true to the computer version.</plot>

During the matches, the opponents try to perform moves while both wrestlers are close together (basically by holding a direction and pressing buttons with the correct timing) to diminish the opponent&apos;s energy. This is necessary so his shoulders can be held to the mat for three seconds, which ends the match. One speciality of this game is the possibility to leave the ring and fight in the locker room or on the street.

Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy&apos;s house! It&apos;s up to Wendy to set things right again!&amp;#xA;Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game. As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity. Wendy has the ability to control gravity herself - by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in that direction. Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching - you&apos;ll need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game&apos;s different puzzles.&amp;#xA;Stars can be used to power up Wendy&apos;s magic. For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase. Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three directions. The stars also act as Wendy&apos;s health meter - if you get hit, you&apos;ll lose a star, as well as some magical power. Get hit when you have no stars left, and you&apos;ll lose a life.&amp;#xA;At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick. In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.</plot>

The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.&amp;#xA;It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you&apos;ll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you&apos;ll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.&amp;#xA;The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</plot>

  <plot>WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is THQ&apos;s first WWF licenced game after making two previous WCW titles. Wrestlemania 2K picks up where WCW/NWO Revenge left off. The graphics are by far superior as well is the animation. Wrestlemania 2K adds three highly sort after features: Cage match, custom entrances and Create A Wrestler feature.&amp;#xA;Wrestlemania 2K features more than 50 real WWF stars as well as the option for 16 custom wrestlers. All the wrestlers come with their real-life theme music, entrance videos (made into slide shows) and entrance performances. A great improvement over the previous game is the &quot;road to Wrestlemania&quot; mode, an enhanced tournament where players can challenge for any number of belts and be challenged by other wrestlers in a 12 month journey that finally leads to Wrestlemania 2000 itself.</plot>

  <plot>You take control of the X-Men (including Wolverine, Storm, Iceman, Gambit, and Cyclops) and must use the powers of each to fight your way through the many levels of evil mutants, crazy machines and boss characters including Magneto.&amp;#xA;You can change the character at any time during the game, which is important as your characters power level decreases as you go. When you change a character, the character you take out rests, and the power level increases. Also, some areas can only be completed by using the certain powers of each character.&amp;#xA;Apart from the normal mode of play, you can also play a second version, where you must fight all of the Boss characters, and if your character runs out of power, you cannot use him/her again.</plot>

  <plot>Xtreme Sports is a sort of &quot;sequel&quot; to the earlier Xtreme Sports Arcade Summer Edition, but with altered characters and an actual story. Fin and his girlfriend Guppi are walking by a store window when they see a commercial advertising Xtreme Cola. The commercial announces that an extreme sports competition is being held by the company on Xtreme Sports Island. Excited, the couple decides to enter the competition, each agreeing to do their best to beat each other, but to split the winnings if either wins. However, when they reach the island, things seem strange. A worker says that there are more boats docking than there should be, despite their efforts to keep the competition a closed event. Furthermore, a strange gang called the Bonehead Gang is competing, claiming they&apos;ll take over the island. In Xtreme Sports, there are several different sports, such as skateboarding, in-line skating, street luge, skyboarding and surfing. The player chooses to play as either Guppi or Fin at the beginning of the game. They must compete in various sports in varying difficulties against all the island&apos;s competitors, earning medals as they go along. Medals can also be found hidden around the island. They must also solve the mystery of the Boneheads. There are power-ups in the form of Twitchy Shakes, an energy drink that increases the players abilities. Each opponent specializes in a certain stat, and each area of the island hosts a different sport. This means that each event must be cleared many times to beat each opponent. There is also a practice mode accessible from the main menu.</plot>

  <plot>In Yars&apos; Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn&apos;t completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can&apos;t stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</plot>

  <plot>It&apos;s the 14th annual Jellystone Park Balloon Fest. And you know what that means for Yogi...campers with pic-a-nic baskets! Yogi has a plan to get those baskets. He&apos;ll pose as a balloon salesman. He just needs to avoid Ranger Smith.&amp;#xA;Boo Boo: &quot;But, Yogi, the Ranger isn&apos;t going to like this.&amp;#xA;Yogi: &quot;Not to worry, Boo Boo, I&apos;m smarter than the average bear!&quot;&amp;#xA;This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several colored balloons while moving left or right. When it reaches the screen edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached. By pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90º and swap the colors. By pressing the A button, you release the balloons. The object is to get three balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to move on.&amp;#xA;Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not, and will not be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you will have defeated Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up a little. If the balloons reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on or end the game.</plot>

  <plot>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;hold&quot;. If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.&amp;#xA;The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn&apos;t break by keeping an eye on the tension.&amp;#xA;Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</plot>

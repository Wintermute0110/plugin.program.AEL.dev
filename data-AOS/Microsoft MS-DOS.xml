  <plot>Aliens: go figure! Years ago Zybonians installed a control-center in the middle of planet Earth, so that years later, they could wrench the planet out of its orbit and bring it to their home system. (As the introduction notes: Why they want that? We don&apos;t know, but why let that get in the way of enjoying the game?)A sequel to their bottomless pit game Deep, written in Turbo Basic 1, Turbo Pascal 4 affords Deep II subtler structure and nuance. Both games follow the same basic premise -- as the documentation states: It&apos;s the same idea as Deep: you fall in a very deep pit. (Nothing is as simple as it seems: the computer randomly draws meandering cavern walls and you must direct your tethered stickman&apos;s descent so as to not collide with them, at the cost of shields.)50 levels later, after picking up money and shield bonuses, avoiding mines, blasting through more than a little rock, and getting boosted with power-ups at automated pit stops, you too will arrive at the centre of the earth and discover the secret behind the Zybonian control-center.</plot>

  <plot>In the simulation of another CBS&apos; TV gameshow with 1,000 questions you can play with a friend or challenge a computer-selected opponent. The gameshow was not aired at the times of game production and released for the first time as pilot in 1996.The object of the game is to earn the most money in two Matches, rob the Vault and make a safe getaway. Match consists of two Rounds: the Number Seeker and the Combination Cracker.Round 1: The Number Seeker gameboard consists of 9 boxes, each numbered from 1 to 99. Before selecting a number, players are asked a randomly selected trivia question, with three possible answers. The first player to select the correct answer gets to choose one of the numbers on the Number Seeker gameboard. (If the first player to answer the question is incorrect, then the second player may answer the question. If both players are incorrect then another question appears.) The first available number is highlighted. The player may highlight another number to display &quot;OPEN,&quot; &quot;LOCKED,&quot; &quot;CASH&quot; or the &quot;BURGLAR.If the box reveals: - &quot;LOCKED,&quot; the player receives no money and play continues. - &quot;OPEN,&quot; the player has found one of the three numbers in the combination of the Vault. The player receives $100 in Match 1 and $150 in Match 2. - &quot;CASH,&quot; the player receives $200 in Match 1 and $400 in Match 2. - &quot;BURGLAR,&quot; the player loses $200 in Match 1 and $400 in Match 2. If the player does not have that much money, all of the player&apos;s money is lost.Once all three numbers in the combination have been found, Round 1 is over.Round 2: The Combination Cracker gameboard consists of 6 boxes containing every possible combination of the numbers revealed in Round 1. The player(s) must answer trivia questions, using the same controls as in Round 1, to earn the chance to try a combination. The safe will turn to each number of the selected combination. If the safe does not open, a buzzer sounds and a new question is asked. If the safe opens, the player earns $400 in Match 1 and $600 in Match 2.Bonus Round: The player with the most money at the end of the two Matches enters the Vault. The Vault gameboard consists of 15 boxes numbered between 1 and 99. The selected box will reveal a cash reward or one of two BURGLARs.The player may continue to select numbers as long as there is cash behind them. After each turn, the player is given the chance to make a &quot;getaway. If player evades, all the money earned in the Vault is kept and the game is over, or player may continue selecting numbers. If the player reveals a BURGLAR, however, all of the money won in the Bonus Round is lost and the game is over. If the player uncovers all 13 of the cash prize boxes on the gameboard, all the money is kept and the game is over.The ten top players of the game are shown in the &quot;MOST WANTED LIST&quot; displayed at the end of each game.</plot>

The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.The game takes place all over Lizard Breath, and there are several different types of action / interaction. The adventure part of the game is very linear, guiding the player in a fairly set sequence of action sections.

  <plot>International Soccer Challenge is loosely a sequel to MicroProse Soccer and it has many similarities to the original, including the way the ball sticks to your player&apos;s foot. The major difference is the visual perspective, which is in pure 3D, viewed just behind the ball as you move up the pitch, with full polygons and some shading. You have a radar on screen to allow you to see where your team-mates are, which reduces the disadvantage of not being able to look behind you.Two tournaments are featured - a superleague and a recreated World Cup, as well as practice modes. By moving the joystick as you shoot, you can adjust the direction and height of a pass or shot, allowing for a wide range of moves.</plot>

  <plot>Noctropolis is an adventure game, with game mechanics that will be familiar to anyone who has ever played LucasArts&apos; classic games or any other representative of the adventure game genre. You play the part of a character in a piece of &quot;interactive fiction,&quot; and it&apos;s up to you to solve the puzzles and overcome the obstacles your character will have to face throughout the game. Noctropolis has a verb-based menu interface that appears if you right-click on the screen. It features live actors filmed over digitized graphics; many conversations and cut-scenes are displayed as short movies shown inside a smaller screen.When you begin Noctropolis, you&apos;re just some guy who owns a bookstore. You also happen to be a huge fan of the &quot;Darksheer&quot; comic book series. Darksheer is a Batman-esque superhero (i.e. he doesn&apos;t have any actual super powers), and, with his partner Stiletto (a former supervillain converted to the side of the good guys), he is the sworn protector of Noctropolis. And Noctropolis is a city where it&apos;s always nighttime, thanks to a permanent ash cloud that hangs over the city (the result of some volcanic environmental catastrophe which occurred decades before the timeline of the story).So one night, as you&apos;re leafing through the newest issue of &quot;Darksheer&quot; to hit the stands, a courier brings you a package which, to make a long story short, eventually transports you into the city of Noctropolis as...you guessed it...Darksheer.Coincidentally enough, your arrival as Darksheer occurs at the same time that five of Darksheer&apos;s deadliest arch-villains decide to gang up on him after they&apos;re mysteriously released from incarceration.It turns out that the real Darksheer had disappeared several weeks prior to your arrival. Nobody knows why, not even Stiletto. But now he&apos;s back! Only he&apos;s not, &apos;cause you&apos;re him and you have no clue what&apos;s going on. It&apos;s up to you to find out who released your enemies while simultaneously trying to keep the newly freed criminals from wreaking havoc across the city of Noctropolis. And maybe, in the process, find a way back to the real world...</plot>

  <plot>Across the Rhine: 1944 - 1945 Armored Combat in Western Europe is a mix between strategy and simulation game set during WWII. The game focuses on single tank battles during the Allied invasion of Normandy - this means the player can&apos;t influence the overall outcome of the war. The battles are mostly historically accurate but some of them use hypothetical situations.The basic situation however is always the same: the player is in charge of tank battalions and tries to defeat his enemy. The player is presented with several windows which show different information, e.g. a tactical map, a strategical map or a battlefield from a tank&apos;s view. The size and position of these windows can be freely arranged. From these windows he also gives orders to his tanks, e.g. assigning waypoints or changing the behaviour. All this is in real-time. The player has also the opportunity to directly take control over a tank - there he has the choice between several viewpoints, including the driver&apos;s or gunner&apos;s view, and controls movement and turret. Optionally the AI can take care of the movement. This part of the game is more simulation than action game.During the three campaigns the player takes control over both parties. He assembles a soldier which, depending on the battle performances, gets promoted during the course of the game which results in the command over more units. There are also many options to set the realism of the game in different areas, e.g. manual fuel distribution, limited ammo, morale, air support or even invulnerability.</plot>

  <plot>Air Power: Battle in the Skies is set in a fantasy world in which humanity lives on one big continent. This means there has never been naval warfare and all action concentrates on aircraft. Unfortunately the king dies without leaving a heir and four factions want to rise to power - of course this means war. At the beginning of the game the player chooses one faction and which aircraft he wants to use (basically a choice between light and heavy hunter).This is an action-oriented flight simulation with strategy elements. The goal is to get the majority of the population behind the player so he can become king. This can be achieved by conquering their cities. On an overhead map the next target settlement is chosen. Now there are three options to chose from: diplomacy (to gather the trust peacefully), besiegement or attacking. Depending on the city&apos;s importance the player has to solve several missions in optional order - the goals range from escort missions over liberating the area to destroying ground targets. Every conquered city produces reinforcements for the fleet. This is important because the fleet sets the prospect of success for diplomacy attempts and gets diminished when the player fails a mission. Another option is to attack another faction with the whole fleet - the defeated party gets eliminated.</plot>

Other improvements include auto-mapping, new character classes, magic spells and dungeon levels (84 of them!) that vary in size and shape. You also get to visit more exotic lands than in the previous installments, for each quest takes place in its own universe: a forest world, a frozen wasteland, and one that&apos;s linked via time warps to different times on earth, from ancient Rome to the Nazis&apos; Berlin. Characters from the previous games may be imported into this one.</plot>

  <plot>At it&apos;s heart, Nyet 3 is a Tetris clone. It does however add a whole lot of variation to that venerable classic. The game is divided into 7 sets of 18 levels, and lets the player go through the levels in a set in any order. To beat a level the player usually has to make a given number of rows disappear, much like in any other Tetris clone. The difference is in the levels themselves. Some levels might have invisible blocks, others an indestructable snake that the player have to trap before theres a chance of making a row disappear.For beating a level, the player receives money, the amount depending on how well they did during gameplay and the difficulty of the level. The money can be used to buy powerups, of which there is a great variety. Some powerups are permanent, such as the monitors previewing the next block. Other powerups are bound to the Function Keys on the keyboard, and can be activated at any time during gameplay. These range from level type specific powerups like the Fork which traps a snake, to general powerups like the Bomb, which destroys the top row of squares. To save the game the player need to buy a powerup as well.</plot>

Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it!As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).The NES version of the game features additional content not present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.</plot>

Like in all such games, your goal on each level is to break all the bricks with a ball, which you bounce with a paddle, and try to save it from falling out of the level. Some bricks have a random power-up within them. There are many various power-ups (most beneficial, some of them harmful), such as: lengthening/shortening our paddle, enlarging or duplicating our ball, adding thrusters to the paddle so that it can fly, adding various weapons so that the paddle can shoot and destroy bricks, and many more. Occasionally, various monsters will appear on the playfield and begin flying around. Most of those are harmless and do nothing except interfering with the ball (if it hits them, it bounces off). However, some monsters will destroy your paddle if they touch it. Each few levels, there comes a special action sequence where you try to defend yourself from a horde of incoming monsters, or defeat a boss by shooting it and avoiding its missiles.</plot>

  <plot>The game represents Ski-Doo, a 6-month length trek set in the snowy woods of North Eastern Canada. Riding snow scooters, participants try to survive in this white desert, hunting for the wild animals and finding warm places following the routes to the cities. Visiting 25 cities along the way, 10 contestants take part in a wild race on ice-circuit to win money. You are one such participant, and you should survive and come to the finish of the overall trek in the first place.This single-player game is shown in a 3rd-person view, while you are controlling your driver, riding a snow scooter, to accelerate/decelerate and turn left/right. As time goes, night will fall after the day and so on. At the same time food and heat levels will decrease, so you should always need to raise them up. The view will be switched to 1-st person, while you are hunting for animals to increase food level.</plot>

  <plot>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</plot>

The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie&apos;s most memorable scenes:1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty&apos;s girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon.

  <plot>This game is very like Cyberia; the moving path is predictable, and all you have to do is shoot at anything that moves, and enjoy the animated sequences in between every mission. The time is set somewhere in the near future, and there is a major war active on your planet. By the time war is battling, the infamous and most dangerous international prisoner was rescued, and the prison guards were killed. As much as you don&apos;t want to participate in that action (since you&apos;re more interested in winning the war), you, as a great undercover agent are sent to bring the prisoner back. No matter the cost. As you can guess by the title, most action is taken under the water, and a few rare are battled in the space above. Bring him back commander!</plot>

  <plot>Deadline is a much overlooked precusor to Rainbow Six with very similar anti-terrorist themes and combined strategic planning / real-time action.It uses a third-person over-the top perspective much like the original X-COM, except in real-time.Deadline pits you against everything from fanatical cultists (some of whom you&apos;re supposed to save from themselves), drug dealers, escaped prisoners, and even a disgruntled MIT professor with a high powered rifle. But terrorists will be your primary opponents in the later missions.Your goal is to rescue the hostages and neutralize the bad guys, but you&apos;re also suppose to avoid blood and death on ALL sides. This means that you&apos;re not allowed to drown your enemies in their own blood, and the majority of them must be captured alive for you to successfully complete the mission.Deadline also allows you to communicate with the terrorists (to a limited extent) through use of a vid-phone and negotiation mode. You can also dedicate time to research in order to get more information about the terrorists, hostages, location, etc. The game is very well fleshed out with an extensive history behind each mission. But as the name of the game suggests there&apos;s a time limit and if you spend too much time twiddling your thumbs the hostages get executed and you&apos;re fired.</plot>

  <plot>Chess is one of the oldest PC games ever made: it was written in March, 1980 and converted to IBM PC in December, 1981. This is probably the very first chess game running in MS-DOS.Taking it&apos;s age into account, it&apos;s no surprise that the game features only text-mode graphics. The chess board and the pieces are drawn using ASCII characters. For the same reason, it&apos;s also no surprise that the user input is based just on keyboard commands.In Chess there is no multiplayer mode - you play only against the computer.

  <plot>FastTracker 2 was an early successful PC .MOD-tracking music composition utility, early competition for Future Crew&apos;s ScreamTracker but more clearly inspired by Amiga tracking software that preceded them both. When called upon to explain its success against such strong competition, some will mumble something about the mouse support, or give a nod toward the ability to &quot;play along&quot; with your song-in-progress in realtime using the computer keyboard. These half-hearted attempts dance around the most telling ingredient in FastTracker 2&apos;s success: it contained a fully-functioning clone of Nibbles, Microsoft&apos;s QBasic take on the classic &quot;snake game&quot; spectacularly depicted with &quot;light bikes&quot; in the feature film Tron.Since the implementation of this game was not the main attraction, it was not especially feature-rich, and only occupied a fraction of the screen display. Nonetheless, all the salient characteristics were there: the boxy worms (multiplayer mode optional) would grow accordingly in length after eating the numbered boxes, dieing after colliding with the walls, each other, their own body or other obstacles. Additional gameplay flavours included variable play speed, absent boundary barriers permitting &quot;wrap&quot;-around, and a superimposed grid indicating more clearly if your snake was about to eat a number-box or munch its own tail.(Apparently some people also used FastTracker 2 to compose music with 8)</plot>

  <plot>Annals of Rome begins in 273BC and sets you as a Roman senator, with the ultimate aim of colonizing as much of the known world as possible, and retaining that power against Carthaginians, Vandals, Parthians, Persians and all the other world forces. You have a strong army at your disposal, and can direct your generals as to which countries they attempt to invade.The game is turn-based, and these turns operate in phases, beginning with the economic circumstances of population and tax income being decided - it&apos;s recommended to keep taxation taxing low unless things become desperate. The game then updates you on the statuses of your generals, and give you the chance to redistribute them to other parts of your kingdom. Officers may rebel and cause a civil war - fortunately this can usually be pre-empted. More serious are attempts to take land from other civilizations, which take place in order and include conflicts between other groups. These, like every element of the game, are accurately historically modeled and variable in time-span as a result.</plot>

Not willing to take his previous exploits as &quot;beginner&apos;s luck&quot; as accused by so called experts, Nevada has been determined to find another great prize to find. One night while scouring old tomes in the university&apos;s library, Nevada finds mention of a band of Vikings who, after a large looting raid, had hidden their ship-full of ancient treasures somewhere in an Arctic cave. Being distrustful of each other, the band of Vikings, tore up the map that lead to the cave into four pieces and hid them as well. Only by putting the map together again would they be able to return to their treasure but as fate would have it after hiding their loot and map pieces the Vikings hit a powerful storm on their venture back and were lost at sea taking with them their secrets.Deciding that he must go in search of this treasure our determined hero asks his old professor Dr. Jones to assist him on his quest. Dr. Jones, though flattered, turns down Nevada due to his large workload but not before tossing Nevada a little parting gift to help him on his quest. There, inside a wrap of cloth if Dr. Jones&apos; trusty old .38 caliber revolver. After running back to his apartment and quickly packing Nevada hitches a ride on an Arctic bound freighter to start his Arctic Adventure.In this sequel to Pharaoh&apos;s Tomb, players again control Nevada Smith. As opposed to the first game the player this time around starts out on a map of caves. Some caves need keys to unlock them while others are accessible only by finding a boat first. In this way the player has some choice over which level they&apos;d like to tackle first. Control-wise Nevada can walk side to side, jump and shoot a gun, for which ammo must be collected on levels. Pick-axes must also be collected to break blocks of ice in your path. Along your journey the player will run into multitudes of enemies from, Yeti to penguins which can be either avoided since they are restricted to moving in strict patterns or dispatched with your revolver. There are of course traps abound in the caves and most will be found too late by players. Natural hazards and obstacles such as spike pits, rolling boulders, and piercing icicles are another thing to be on the watch for. Lastly another introduction in this sequel is the presence of icy cave floors. Players must judge their movements carefully to control themselves and predict the predicament they may find themselves in by stepping on to the ice covered platforms.The entire game is split into four volumes comprised of twenty levels each with the first volume being the shareware version of the game. The volumes are simply titled Vol.1, Vol.2, Vol.3 and Vol.4. Keys and special items must be collected before advancing on to locked levels. The players have five lives but a save mode is available allowing the players to prolong their adventure. Saves can be made on the map screen and cannot be made while part-way through a level. A high-score table is available from the main menu displaying the top five scores.</plot>

  <plot>The Yanchooz with their leader Xyfud Plasfoc are the bad guys of the universe. They try to destroy and enslave all other races and you are one of them. To be more specific, you are their worst fighter who screwed up the last 18 missions. As a consequence your leader is pretty pissed off of you and wants you dead. Your task is it to head to Earth, the only race who could defend itself successfully against the Yanchooz so far, and open a road for your capital ships. The problem is that you are completely alone. Nobody believes in you and now it&apos;s up to you to accomplish this suicidal mission.Earth Invasion is a shareware space arcade shooter with 10 missions. In each of the 10 missions you have to defeat five waves of human ships that differ from each other in their type and their amount. To clean each system a capital ship needs to be destroyed. After that you return to your home destroyer but your ship won&apos;t be repaired (remember, they want you dead) and you carry your defects into the next system. But your space fighter is equipped with HIJKE shield converters. From time to time a HIJKE capsule prowls through the system and when you catch it your shield regenerates. Unfortunately you only have 30 shield converters i.e. you should ration these capsules. Shareware version is limited to the first five missions and you can&apos;t save your game.</plot>

Here is your chance.Blind Wars is very similar to RISK, except that you cannot see your opponents&apos; armies, nor can your opponents see yours. This makes for unpredictable outcomes to the game. This game is a four player game, where three of the players are computer-controlled.Although it is similar to RISK, you are not playing on a true world map. You play on a group of countries and you are trying to take control of the 77 cities.Also in the game are various random occurrences that can affect the outcome of the game. Occurrences such as a city defecting to the enemy, or increased armies in a city or country happen randomly throughout the game making the game even more unpredictable.</plot>

  <plot>A madman with power to kill millions has been discovered, and HUNT (High-risk United Nations Taskforce) has been dispatched to discover his plans. Your team was infiltrating his island stronghold when everything went to hell. The infiltration boat exploded and fire came from all directions. The only way out is in, into the the fortress, but to stay out here would be certain death. So in you go, guns blazing...Rise of the Triad, a first-person shooter, is the successor of Wolfenstein 3D, with a somewhat improved 3D engine. Everything is still composed from blocks, but multiple vertical levels have been added; there are stairs made of platforms floating in air, and jump pads which launch you (and the enemies) high up so that you can walk over tall barriers in your way. The game offers a lot of weapons. You begin with a pistol, but later you can find an extra pistol for John Woo-style shooting, and a MP40 rifle. All these weapons have unlimited ammo. You can also find more potent weapons - from classic rocket launcher, to quite wacky contraptions such as a &quot;drunk missile&quot; launcher or the &quot;Excalibat&quot;, a powerful baseball bat. However, you can carry only one such a strong weapon at a time, and they have limited ammo. Enemies are mostly humans equipped with various weapons. Their attacks can be quite varied; some of them can steal your weapons (though you can retrieve them after killing them), other shoot nets at you that trap you (you have to wriggle out, unless you found a knife, which will allow you to cut your way out). Apart from enemies, you&apos;ll be endangered by fireball launchers, rolling boulders and crushing walls. There&apos;s a lot of power-ups you can pick up. They all have various wacky effects: for example, &quot;God Mode&quot; makes you immortal and allows you to toss homing, insta-death missiles; &quot;Dog Mode&quot; turns you into a... dog, which can fit into small spaces (and is inexplicably invulnerable to weapons); &quot;Shrooms Mode&quot; makes everything shine with bright colours, as if you were on drugs; &quot;Elasto Mode&quot; makes you very prone to bouncing off walls when you run into them. ROTT also offers a lot of multi-player game modes; there&apos;s the standard deathmatch and &quot;Capture the Triad&quot;, but there are also more varied modes - e.g. in &quot;Collector&quot; the players have no weapons, instead trying to collect as many &quot;triads&quot; as possible; in &quot;Deluder&quot;, the players earn points by destroying &quot;eluders&quot; which move around the level.</plot>

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they&apos;re at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits &apos;til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</plot>

A group of horsemen raided his village...Conan was knocked unconscious, awakening only to find his wife and his friends butchered in the aftermath. Conan discovers architect of the slaughter was a wizard named Thoth Amon, a high priest of Cult of Set. Sword in hand, vengeance aflame, Conan now travels south in the land of Hyborea to the city of Shadizar. Here his journey of vengeance begins...Conan: The Cimmerian is an action-adventure game with some RPG elements. The game is divided into 3 areas. The first is the overland map, where Conan may travel only between identifiable town and other locations. The second is the town map, here Conan is viewed in a horizontal 3rd Person and the last is the combat screen (or when he enters houses) where Conan is viewed in vertical 3rd Person. Conan may also view his character status and inventory sheet, anytime during the course of the game.Gameplay consists of exploration and combat. The exploration element in the game sets Conan to find his way around towns and hidden locations, often breaking in houses and searching the premises for hidden loot. Towns consist of various places to visit, among others temples which usually offer quests, shops offering weapons and other items, and inns to stay for a health boost. NPCÆs may be conversed with to seek information, while the tougher-looking types may be provoked into combat.Combat is real-time, one-on-one with Conan on the left and the opponent on the right, consisting of only movement to the left or right and attacking. There are no defensive maneuvers. Both must now keep on attacking until the health bar of either side drops to zero. If Conan wins, he may search the remains and may find loot. At the beginning of the game, Conan may only use one sword style (swing) out of three available sword styles. Additional sword styles may be trained by a sword master.</plot>

  <plot>Another Laserdisc conversion of one of Don BluthÆs cartoons: Space Ace II: BorfÆs Revenge continues the saga of young cadet Dexter, who tries to free his love Kimberly from the clutches of the evil nemesis Borf. In critical situations, the meek Dexter can transform into his mighty alter ego Space Ace. Thus empowered, he has to defeat BorfÆs minions.Space Ace II is a essentially a cartoon strip in which our hero will encounter numerous hazards. You have to avoid traps and enemies by pressing the right key at the right time: cursor keys for movements, Insert key to shoot. You never control Dexter directly, you just choose an appropriate direction. Each of the 27 seconds-long scenes requires one to three keystrokes. If your decision is wrong, the cartoon will end with a death animation, and Dexter will lose one of his three lives. So youÆre basically trying to keep the strip running. Timing is crucial; you will need to press keys in the exact second. Luckily, youÆre allowed to save your progress at four fixed points.Space Ace II is ported to the PC from the original arcade Laserdisc version. The result is a cut version due to space restraints. Although Space Ace II comes on 12(!) low density 5 1/4&amp;quot; discs, most scenes are shortened noticeably.</plot>

Before taking off you can visit Rodney&apos;s skate shop to buy equipment.The first event is freestyle, in which your aim is to score as many points as possible in 10 attempts. Judges determine how much style and skill you have shown. The High Jump uses the same equipment, only this time your task is to jump as high as possible at the end of the ramp.The downhill events are overhead-view races. In the Downhill Race you simply try to complete the course within 90 seconds. In the Downhill Jam you try to outperform a human or computer opponent whilst dodging or jumping hazards. You can use attacking moves to either remove hazards or knock your opponent over. The pool joust is more of a one-on-one beat em up using a stick, set within a pit to skate around.</plot>

But not just any Prime Minister, this game puts you in the shoes of Prime Minister James (Jim) Hacker from the classic BBC television comedy &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. Much like most political simulations, you must balance your popularity with the needs of your party, the meddling of foreign governments, and the small minded incompetence of the civil servants that surround you. All of this is played out with multiple choice dialogues between Hacker and the other cast members of the series (complete with lo-res digital pictures). The dry humor of the show abounds as you must deal with crises such as the French refusing to continue work on the channel tunnel until Waterloo station is renamed. Fans of the show will recognize much of the material and non-fans should still find enough laughs to keep them interested.</plot>

A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witness everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After her dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain&apos;s chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.Treasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the homonymous classic 1883 Scottish novel. Unlike the book, the game is written in second person. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of on-line hint system. The player can ASK them ABOUT anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of the Infocom&apos;s standard features like pronouns and chain commands.</plot>

  <plot>Subtrade: Return to Irata is Dan Bunten&apos;s classic M.U.L.E. revamped for VGA and set underwater.Presentation aside, the game preserves the graceful game mechanics and the multiplayer addictiveness of its model, with four players competing for economic dominance in a round-based closed market scenario. True to the setting, players grow fish and hoard pearls and take domesticated turtles by the leash to their seafloor farmlands.In finest M.U.L.E. tradition, Subtrade is best when played with four human players, though uniform AI replacements make for a moderate challenge. Each game ends after one year, i.e. twelve rounds, with the wealthiest player winning.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the legendary Frank Herbert novel of the same name and visually inspired by the 1984 David Lynch movie, Dune is a strategy-adventure hybrid where the player takes the role of young Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto. The Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has given the Atreides House the rights to manage the extraction of the most precious substance in the entire universe - the Melange, commonly known as Spice in the desolate desert planet Arrakis (Dune), the only place in the universe capable of producing the substance. While everything indicates the offer is a trap orchestrated by their enemies the Harkonnen, the Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe.The player arrives in Arrakis with the mission of contacting and convincing the Fremen tribes residing in sietches (desert settlements) near the Atreides palace to harvest the spice. Harvesting is the most important part of the game, required to purchase equipment from the smugglers and appease the emperor. To speed up the process of harvesting, the player can equip the tribes with harvesters to increase production and ornis to protect them from the gigantic protectors of the planet: Shai-Hulud - the sandworms. However, the spice doesn&apos;t last forever and new sietches must be prospected before having a mining crew assigned, but the player cannot run Southwards forever, as the Harkonnen enemy controls the North of the Planet, dangerously close to the Atreides Palace. Soon after the initial batches are sent to the Emperor, the player will have to actively deal with the Harkonnen, who will try to take control of player Sietches. For those, Fremen tribes can be assigned to military training with Gurney Halleck, but before doing such work Paul must have a certain reputation, gained by the control of Arrakis.As the game advances, the player will untap Paul&apos;s latent powers, as well as meeting other characters from the Dune universe, such as Duke Leto, Jessica, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Harah, Chani, Stilgar and Liet Kynes, the mastermind behind the ecological plans on Dune - the ultimate goal.</plot>

  <plot>This game was among the first ones produced in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Essentially it&apos;s a one-on-one fighting game, featuring Russian peasants engaging in bitter hand-to-hand combat. Although the intro claims that the knowledge was found contained in &quot;ancient scrolls describing Russian Sobor combat system&quot; the moves are clearly taken from modern martial arts. You must complete five fights before a no holds barred brawl between the fighters of your village and those of a rival one. This brawl is computer-controlled and resolved, but the performance of each of your fighters is defined by how you well you fought during the preceding one-on-one sparring sessions.</plot>

  <plot>Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom is the sequel to Ishar: Legend of the Fortress.Following the defeat of Krogh and the banishment of the powers of chaos, Ishar became a cultural and intellectual centre in Kendoria. Over time people came to the island and settled there and a city, named &quot;Zach&apos;s Island&quot; developed. Shandar, a monk of chaos, entered the city along with settlers from the northern lands. His trading in hallucinogens soon made him rich and powerful. Eventually Shandar controlled &quot;Zach&apos;s Island&quot; and had many followers and worshippers. He built a strong fortress, a second Ishar, to challenge the empire.In the sequel you can import saved characters from Ishar, or create your own team.In the game you have to explore the magic land (dungeons, tree-cities, mountain paths with real graded height effect), fight the enemies, join the allies and relax in towns, which even have medieval nightclubs. Now the area is 3 times bigger, and innovation is your ability to use pet animals as allies in battles, and create magic potions. There are day and night cycles.</plot>

  <plot>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don&apos;t but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city&apos;s size grows so do it&apos;s needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the 1992 feature film, The Lawnmower Man is a collection of minigames based on the revolutionary virtual reality sequences seen in the movie. The plot parallels the central conflict - the player controls Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) as he heads into cyberspace to confront the psychotic digital god Jobe (Jeff Fahey) he has created.As the ruler of his digital domain, Jobe shifts and manipulates the virtual world into a series of challenges to test the player. These range from digital IQ tests, chase sequences requiring precision timing for jumping and ducking, and a tunnel flight as one of the virtual jets from the movie. Characters from the movie are also digitized by Jobe into willing henchmen, and must be defeated by the player in a series of quick time events.All of the sequences are pre-rendered and streamed off the disc as movie files. Despite the computer-generated visuals, the game itself technically functions like an interactive movie (i.e. the graphics are not being drawn by the player&apos;s computer in real-time). Therefore, all the limitations of an interactive movie are still in play. Controls are extremely basic for each minigame, and failing to hit the right button at the right time generally switches to a lengthy &quot;game over&quot; video with no branching paths.</plot>

  <plot>This multi-genre military action game puts player in the seat of tactical commander of mechanized forces. Starting as Cadet, you&apos;ll raise your career from the rookie, when you should perform actions by yourself in different vehicles, to the ultimate elite, when you should act as a Tactical genius. There are three kinds of combat simulations:1. MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you should sit in tank&apos;s cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and eliminate surrounding enemies;2. FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ;3. ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical position.Performing useful actions in each mode, you&apos;ll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you&apos;ll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.</plot>

  <plot>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a 2D shooting gallery.In the early 90Æs, two things just wouldnÆt die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading WashingtonÆs Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. YouÆll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terroristÆs plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you donÆt kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terroristÆs bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.For more information on the movie Die Hard 2, see the trivia and links sections.</plot>

  <plot>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn&apos;t always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as &apos;hard left&apos; and how early the warning should be given.The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.</plot>

  <plot>In this strategy game, three to seven players (1-6 humans and at least one computer-controlled) compete to progress from tribe to clan to nation to empire. They will face not only each other, but also famine, plague, civil war, insurrection, and earthquakes. To win, each player will build cities and fleets; do battle; form alliances; produce grain, metal, and trade goods; and barter.Players must also choose a &quot;basis of law&quot; (Theocracy, Oligarchy, Utopia, or Khanate). This choice will affect consumption rates, production, and battle strength. It can also affect the probability and/or severity of the various disasters. Khanates are nomadic raiders and have some slightly different rules from the other types.Although the game is turn-based as far as each player giving movement commands, the execution of the commands is random. After all players have entered their commands, the computer executes them in a random order. In some cases, this can prevent another player&apos;s orders from being carried out.In addition to the main game, players can also choose from two shorter scenarios. The first is called Imperium. In it, players just build cities and fleets and do not trade. The winner is the player who defeats the others in battle. The second scenario is Traders. In this game, there is no movement or battle, just trade. The first player to accumulate 1000 trade points wins.</plot>

Jeremy, a painter from New York, goes out at night and learns the story about a cursed land from a old man sitting on the sidewalk. Suddenly the man disappears, leaving his necklace behind, and Jeremy is transported to the cursed land. He ends up in an empty palace where he finds some diaries, the only remaining signs of King Drew III and his daughter Cassandra. More people are disappearing and parts of the land have become barren. Only if Jeremy succeeds in breaking the curse he will be able to return to his dimension. Heaven&apos;s Dawn is a 3rd person fantasy adventure, similar in style and length to The Legend of Kyrandia. The graphics window is presented as a painting on an easel. By right-clicking a floating and scrollable inventory is accessed.

Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lß Klax.

  <plot>In this racing game, the players get to race in police cars instead of the usual racing cars driven by speed freaks (like in the Crazy Cars series). Break the law instead of upholding it, while racing through the streets of San Francisco (Cisco for short, hence the name). Take in the Golden gate Bridge, China Town and the Twin Peaks.Avoid collisions with trams, other cars (driven by annoying citizens), buildings and road blockades etc., while trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out! Use your horn to alert other road-users of your presence.</plot>

Power ups are on offer, and the levels include some interesting design features, including ladders, spikes and springs to bounce off.You can switch between the 3 characters (Mr Blobby, Mrs Blobby and Baby Blobby) at any point, and only lose once all 3 are out of lives.

It&apos;s futuristic, as it takes place in the third millennium, a time where motor boats can dive not just in water, but also in lava, acid and all kinds of dangerous substances. You can test your abilities in no less than 15 circuits, in which you will need to face precipices, make incredible jumps and even immerse in water as if you were inside a submarine. There are at least 10 available weapons (from lasers to torpedoes) to satisfy your most anti-fair play inclinations, but beware, your rivals could use them against you, too. Also, if you&apos;re in the mood of playing against humans, there&apos;s also a multiplayer mode, which works either by IPX, local network or regular internet connection.</plot>

  <plot>SimuSex 1.0 is a simplistic &quot;sex simulator&quot; for DOS made by Erosoft. Apart from selecting a position and waving your mouse back and forth while watching the animated naked girls, there&apos;s not really much of content or depth in the &quot;game&quot;. The few novelties of SimuSex are fluid animation, the fact that it was one of the first virtual girl-programs with more than still graphics and text descriptions, and that it was extremely widespread in many BBS&apos;es in the 90&apos;s.A copy of SimuSex 2.0 is promised when registering the game. The developers promise MPEG1 SVGA quality digitalized video on software, interactive 3D models with toys, digitized sound effects, sort of a &quot;mood&quot; AI for the girls and a range of other ahead of their time -features. Unfortunately(?) the 2.0 version never realized into a real product, and the rather unknown company faded into oblivion after the release of this product.</plot>

  <plot>Trouble is in Cobra City! Gangsters roam the streets, and gang bosses seem to have taken the power in the city. Who is responsible for the situation? It is up to you, the private investigator JR Knight, and your lovely companion Faythe, to find out what is going on!Cobra Mission is based on an earlier Japanese-only game of the same name, but was developed from scratch and has many important differences that make it an independent title rather than a port.Like the original game, it is a Japanese animΘ-style RPG with erotic content. The game takes place in Cobra City, a large town divided into several parts. The player navigates the characters through the city in top-down view, visiting various buildings, talking to people, gathering information, and fighting random enemies. During battles, the game switches to first-person perspective. Unlike the Japanese-only earlier release, the battles are not turn-based. The player must click on the picture of the enemy in real time to inflict damage. The mouse cursor is always slightly moving during battles, which makes aiming more difficult. Many enemies have weak and strong areas, and it is necessary to aim precisely in order to have success. After major quests, the protagonists rescues girls who will be grateful, giving him their telephone numbers. It is then possible to visit them and participate in erotic mini-games: The player is given a certain number of turns, during which he has to perform the correct actions to seduce the girl successfully. Many locations and characters were completely re-designed, and story events added or altered. There are also more different enemy types and many more items to find in this version.</plot>

  <plot>For those who enjoyed the role-playing games from SSI&apos;s AD&amp;D Gold Box series, Unlimited Adventures allows players to create their own similar games. (It is also required to play games created with it.) It was designed to create fantasy games, especially those set in the Forgotten Realms world. For those uninitiated: in Gold Box games, the player typically controls a party of adventurers, leading them through cities and dungeons (presented in first person view), talking to people, finding treasure, buying things in shops, etc. and fighting combats. When combat begins, the screen switches to a top-down perspective where the player can control each of his party members while they fight the opponent. This is also how games created with UA look. The basic elements of each UA-created game (called &amp;quot;design&amp;quot;) are its &amp;quot;modules&amp;quot;, that is, the &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; that the player will be travelling through. The designer builds the modules by arranging walls and choosing floors &amp;amp; ceilings, and then comes the most important part - setting up the events. The events control everything interesting that happens in the game: combats, text messages, NPC joining the party/leaving it, the party visiting a temple/shop/tavern etc. Art is an important aspect of any game. UA comes with a lot of art, depicting various monsters, characters, items etc. but it is possible to import your own art. The designer can also edit the monsters. There are a lot of monsters (such as goblins, dragons or zombies) and humanoid enemies (brigands, bandits, evil mages etc.) and characters provided by default, but the designer can change their name, appearance and attributes.</plot>

  <plot>Sorcerian is the fifth game in the Dragon Slayer series. It is set in the fantasy land known as Pentawa, whose inhabitants are in constant need of protection from ferocious creatures roaming the wilderness. The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</plot>

  <plot>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</plot>

  <plot>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy &apos;links&apos; course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</plot>

  <plot>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</plot>

  <plot>Waterloo, arguably the most famous battle in history, was fought on June 18, 1815 between the French Forces of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the English and combined Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces under Field Marshall Blucher.Waterloo the game was a revolutionary new concept in wargaming when it was published in 1989. Waterloo dispensed with the normal overview given to wargame commanders and instead gave a player the same point of view as real commanders on the field of battle.Your orders in an age of pre-radio communication must pass through an elaborate chain of command with varying levels of success in the execution of those orders. Your orders may even be ignored if there is better local intelligence or your officers lack the skill or courage to perform them. You as the commander (Napoleon or Wellington) must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events and the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. You are also given the option to review the battlefield.The game is solitaire only and the playing time is 10-20 hours.</plot>

  <plot>Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the &quot;Nocturnal Missions&quot; pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, F�?�hrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It&apos;s followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it&apos;s possible to move behind the guards&apos; backs and even there&apos;s a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate &quot;push walls&quot; and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the &apos;par&apos; time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).</plot>

Using your needling ship, the Red Hunter, it is your job to wrap through to unsuspecting fringe worlds... plummet from orbit in your drop ship, suppressing noncooperative entities (NOPs) as best you can in order to acquire your primary target items.

When the coin bounces back, you need to make sure you don&apos;t miss it with the sword otherwise that coin will be lost; lose all of your coins and the game ends. Unlike most Breakout style games, you don&apos;t need to destroy every brick on the screen, you only need to get a coin through all the layers of bricks and hit the back wall to complete the level and advance in rank. To make the game more challenging, one of several enemies will be wandering around the playfield, some of which will create additional bricks to get in the way. They can be destroyed with a coin, however when that happens the game speed will increase! As you increase in rank, the number of brick walls you need to get through will gradually increase.

  <plot>Cruise for a Corpse is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface.1927. When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn&apos;t need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the best tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.You advance in the plot not so much by solving common object-based puzzles, but by talking to the right persons about the right subjects at the right time, thus collecting clues. You will also find pieces of evidence scattered throughout the ship. However, most items suddenly appear in cupboards and drawers that were previously empty -- an awfully unnerving process. The clock advances in ten-minute-steps whenever you discover an interesting clue, which conveniently informs you of your progress. The protagonists move around the ship; so whenever time passes, different persons to talk to might appear at certain locations.With Cruise for a corpse, Delphines Cinematique interface reached &amp;quot;Evolution 2&amp;quot;. Instead of containing a fixed number of verbs, the command menu is now context-sensitive. The mouse cursor will change its appearance when moved over an interesting object; a left-click brings up a set of appropriate verbs. For example, a cupboard may be opened and searched, whereas a key can be picked up and turned. A right-click accesses the inventory. Another interesting improvement: All the persons in the game are animated polygons (see Trivia).</plot>

The Normal mode is just like Basic except that some of the shapes contain special tiles. These tiles are activated when the square containing them disappears. Some tiles, like bombs and score multipliers, are helpful, while others, like spikes, should be left alone. In the Extreme mode there are a lot more of these special tiles.Squarez also features a head to head mode.

As it&apos;s name suggests, this game is directed at a mature audience. This is because this version contains several erotic images with celebrities on them. These images will -initially- appear in a covered way as the background of each level, but will slowly be uncovered as you complete lines. A level is passed once the image is fully visible. As the player advances the blocks will fall faster and faster and sometimes the game will even start with some blocks already located on the screen.</plot>

  <plot>Commander Keen 5: The Armageddon Machine is a platform game, the fifth in the Commander Keen series as a whole, and the second in the second series Goodbye, Galaxy.Eight-year-old genius Billy &quot;Commander Keen&quot; Blaze, having learnt about the alien Shikadi&apos;s plans to destroy the galaxy, arrives on board of their ship, the Omegamatic, in order to destroy it and prevent the evil deed.The objective is to reach and destroy the core of the Omegamatic, but before this happens, Keen must find and destroy four machines which protect the main elevator. The game begins with a top-down map of the Omegamatic. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter. On each level, you have to either make your way to the exit, or destroy a vital machine if there is one on this level. Once you finish the level, you&apos;re back on the overhead map. The levels are full of enemies, mostly robots of various kinds. There are also many deadly hazards. If Keen gets shot or touched by an enemy, or falls into a pit or touches something hazardous, he dies, and you lose one life. Thankfully, Keen can stun most enemies with his raygun. He also carries a pogo stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include: ammo, gems and keycards that are needed to open locked doors, bonus items which give score, jars of &quot;Vitalin&quot; (100 of them give an extra life) and the rare Keg O&apos; Vitalin which gives an extra life.</plot>

Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord&apos;s demonic minions, not to mention the castle&apos;s still functional booby-traps.Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It&apos;s allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you&apos;ll trip in the dark and break your neck.A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</plot>

The Crossbow event involves moving a crosshair so as to hit one of an array of rotating targets. Once you&apos;ve mastered this you are ready for Archery - this time you must hit targets which move from left to right, so timing is more important.The other six involve one-on-one combat. There are two sword-fighting battles against different backdrops; in each of them you must make 10 hits to get your opponent down, and do that 10 times to win overall. Time your jabs and shields to achieve this.The other four events follow the same formula, but with slightly different weapons. The Quartermast event is on a log, although the action is still only 2-dimensional. Ball &amp;amp; Chain, Axe and Pike battles complete the set. All can be played by 2 human players.</plot>

  <plot>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL &apos;94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series.Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or &quot;regular season&quot; in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides). While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</plot>

By selecting two squares with the keyboard or mouse, the player can swap their locations on the screen. The object is to reassemble the image to its original appearance. A variety of now-obscure graphics formats are supported: *.PIC, *.SCN, *.BSP, *.BSS, *.PAK, *.PBL, *.IFF and *.LBM. The puzzles can scale from 32 to 256 pieces in size. It is possible to save and later reload a puzzle in progress. The program also comes with Pixel Puzzle Maker, a utility which allows Print Shop clip art to be used to create new *.BSP graphics for use in the Puzzler.</plot>

You&apos;ll start off with a city, which must then produce armies, that are used to conquer more cities. The array of unit types is limited to eight, including various ships, fighter planes, ground units and a submarine. This is more than made up for by the significantly different abilities each of the units possess, and the game will mostly likely appeal to the Chess and Risk player&apos;s of the world.</plot>

  <plot>Roger Wilco, the brave interstellar janitor who has already saved the universe from many great dangers, is now in a very embarrassing position. His commanders show no respect for his courageous actions in Space Quest 5. Instead, he is being accused of all kinds of violations against the galactic law, is deprived of all the honors he got in the previous game, and as a token of mercy, is allowed to return to his old job - cleaning closets... But those unfortunate events are just the beginning of much bigger troubles Roger will get into. Once again, the future of galaxy depends on him!&quot;Space Quest 6&quot; is the first Space Quest game to be released exclusively on a CD ROM. It features SVGA graphics and voice-overs. The interface is a bit different from the classic Sierra icon-based one: you choose verbs from a menu, a bit like in earlier LucasArts games. &quot;Space Quest 6&quot; continues the humorous tradition of the series and is especially inclined towards parody on famous sci-fi movies.</plot>

  <plot>Super Pac-Man is just another game from Namco&apos;s Pac-Man family, but instead of gobbling up dots, Pac is required to eat fruit and prizes, such as apples, bunches of bananas, doughnuts, hamburgers, fried eggs, ears of corn, sneakers, pieces of cakes, raspberries, limes, cups of coffee, mushrooms, Galaxians, bells and shamrocks. Most of these items are hidden in passages that have locked doors at either entrance, and in order to unlock the doors, Pac needs to eat the key that is closest to the passage that he wishes to unlock. As usual, ghosts will keep chasing Pac around the maze until he has lost all his lives. However, Pac can enter the warp tunnels at either side of the maze to lose the ghosts quickly.There are two types of power pellets in the maze: green and yellow. Yellow power pellets cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac to eat them for points, whereas green ones cause Pac to enlarge and will also cause the ghosts to become much thinner and wider, allowing him to fly over them. He can also break open the doors without the need of keys. The effects of the pellets, unfortunately, only lasts for a number of seconds. During the time that he is enlarged, a flashing star will appear besides two boxes that are located in the middle of the maze. The first box will display the current fruit or prize, and the other will display a rotating selection of them. If Pac manages to eat the star when they match, there will be a large bonus score.Occasionally, after three or more stages, there will be a bonus stage where Pac automatically gets enlarged. The object of these stages is to eat everything in the maze before the time runs out, and during these stages, there will be no ghosts to pursue him.</plot>

  <plot>Death Rally is a top-down racing game where the player can rely on more than speed to be the number one, and brains must be riding along brawn to get the most from each race. Starting with only $495 and a lowly car, the player must compete in one of three races (picked from 19 tracks) with increasingly difficult opponents but higher rewards, getting enough money to buy new cars, choosing from six models, and enhance them with one to four upgrades for engine (increase top speed), tires (improve traction, allowing to drift less on turns) and armor (reduces the damage caused by opponents, mines or collisions). But there are more ways to spend money by reaching the underground market where the player can buy land mines (can be dropped to get opponents directly behind or create traps in narrow sections), get some rocket fuel (which increases boost speed greatly at the expense of some damage for both the user car and the ones directly behind) or bribe a mechanic to mess around with the best-ranked opponent car. All these upgrades are valid for one race only.The race varies in length depending on the difficulty chosen, but follow the same structure: four drivers with the starting grid set according to the championship table, with the worst placed starting in front and so on, and the first to cross the line after the stipulated number of laps wins or the last driver standing wins. At the same time, the fourth place driver gets no points and no money, including pick up bonuses, and lapped drivers get the same luck. The player can use a booster to increase speed for a few seconds, but once the reserve is depleted, the player has to wait it replenishes or pick up icons scattered on the track. Similar items appear to replenish ammo, repair the car or give small money bonuses. Occasionally, large money and repair items appear, which provide a much larger bonus. Along the money earned in races, there are several bonuses if the player manages to wipe out all competition, complete the race without a scratch or completing a streak of wins, or accepting certain missions for some sponsors, such as collecting steroids and win the race or destroy an opponent. The value of these bonus changes according to the car: a bonus with the Vagabond can be worth as little as $650, but with the Deliverator a mission can be worth 12 grand, regardless of the race selected.The ultimate goal is to top the championship table, and then defeat the Adversary in a special track.</plot>

They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world&apos;s governments. SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them.As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD&apos;s forces have grown from strength to strength, the various agencies have now put together an underground task force which they hope will combat the growing threat. This elite task force comprises one agent (yourself - nice of you to volunteer by the way), a highly trained mechanic called Harry, and a field support officer to assign missions. The plan is that you will &quot;borrow&quot; aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres, you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent&apos;s Basic Training School.In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your &quot;borrowed&quot; aircraft. Your Commanding Officer will give you a mission objective which you have to try to achieve without being shot down, blown up or crashing into mountains.Jetstrike is an 2D side-scrolling action game like Br°derbundÆs Wings of Fury. The great difference between these games is, in Jetstike itÆs possible to use 32 aircraft and 6 helicopters in several combat-missions or to be a part of the Aerolympics.</plot>

As Jr., you need to eat all of the dots in a maze without running into the four ghosts that are trying to get you. The maze is now much larger, and no longer fits on a single screen. The maze will scroll around to follow the action. From time to time a tasty bonus will bounce around the screen which can be eaten for extra points. There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him! Located throughout the maze are power pellets; when Jr. eats one of these, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and can now be eaten to earn even more points.</plot>

  <plot>Zyconix is an arcade puzzle game.Colored blocks raining down on a playfield, weÆve seen that before. Zyconix takes the Columns principle (align three or more bricks of the same color to make them disappear) and adds a few twists of its own:1. First, there are no groups or columns of stones, only single blocks.2. Second, several of them slide down at once, and you select and move them with a cursor.3. Third, only horizontal and diagonal lines disappear, but not stacks of the same color.Add a few special objects from bombs to drills to a breakout ball that you can actually deflect grabbing a brick as a paddle, mix with four play modes (normal, pre-filled playfield and two time trial variants), and the result is a fast-pasted, tricky test of agility. Two players can compete in split-screen mode, where each removed line turns the corresponding number of bricks on the opponentÆs field into indestructible obstacle blocks. Soloists adjust the difficulty level by tweaking the number of blocks in a line (from three to six), number of colors and frequency of new stones appearing.</plot>

However, unlike in Catacomb 3-D, where you spent the whole game inside a dungeon, here you&apos;ll explore various environments, both indoors and outdoors. There are new enemies to face, such as zombies that come from under the ground or skeletons that come out of walls. New to the game is a radar which shows you the location of foes. However, you have to find gems of various colours to use it effectively; each gem allows you to see a specific type of enemy on the radar.

  <plot>Medieval Lords is a strategic political/war simulator starting in 1028AD and continuing for up to 100 turns / 500 years. Up to 10 players can take part, with the computer controlling up to 6. Limits can be set on how many actions can be performed in each turn, so be wary of over-expanding if there is not much time to give orders. Gameplay takes place in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, in a world full of conquests, diseases and change. You are an adviser to a King, Caliph, Sultan or other leader, and must first manage domestic issues such as the economy and political stability, before attempting to conquer or form alliances with other regions. Random events such as plagues and religious orders ensure that each game is different.</plot>

Three skill levels are provided - Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.</plot>

Eventually, her wishes come true as she meets a wealthy tycoon who hires her to retrieve a single artifact from a ruined temple in South America. After you get the artifact, you find out that it&apos;s only one out of three mysterious parts that are hidden in a &apos;tomb&apos; world all around the globe. You&apos;ll travel through many worlds and distinguish places like Egyptian sphinxes, Greek temples, Atlantis and more... and with each, tougher traps and riddles to confront. Since tombs are usually radiated with &apos;no-living-person&apos; atmosphere, you won&apos;t find much of a human enemy on your quest, in fact quite a small amount. Most of all, you&apos;ll battle wolves, bears, bats, and that sort of animals. Just to add a woman touch to all of that, you&apos;ll be using a pair of magnums, a shotgun and an Uzi to express your feelings. Each level brings a new world to explore and new threats to our heroine, so watch your steps and be cautious.</plot>

This is a side-scrolling action game where Boone must fight his way through Midian, fighting the Sons of the Free and the Berserkers.There are five legs to Boone&apos;s quest as listed in the manual:1) Collect the 3 keys to Midian; one is located on each level. In order to obtain the 3rd key, you must defeat the MASK (although he will subsequently escape).2) Work your way around the Necropolis and down through Midian to the Nightbreeds&apos; God, BAPHOMET, who will then baptize you. This will enable you to transform into CABAL for short periods of time. CABAL can withstand attack better than BOONE and has greater strength than his alter ego.3) Open the door to the BERSERKERS chamber.4) Work your way up to the surface of Midian to free the Breed. They then tell you that the MASK has your girlfriend, LORI.5) Descend back down and engage in the ultimate battle with the MASK. With victory achieved, you must get back to the surface of Midian where you will be re-united with LORI.</plot>

Due to the simplicity of the program and the lack of pins bouncing around once struck it is impossible to pick up a split. The players also select at which speed the game runs in the beginning, individually or as a group, allowing for more precise control or faster games.

  <plot>This is the third game in the Super Cars series of top-down view, arcade racing games from Magnetic Fields. As always, there is also a management portion available in the game (which is optional).The game is basically a re-make of Super Cars II, with added elements, tweaked gameplay, updated 256-color VGA graphics and a new soundtrack.The game lets you compete in three built-in seasons (easy, medium, hard) but also lets you customize your own seasons. All the 21 tracks seems to have been lifted from the previous title, but here you can choose the amount of laps and also race them in reverse.If you are running a season using the &quot;full&quot; option, which means including the management portion, you have to buy your own cars to race with. This is done at a car dealer between each race, using a mini-game with different chat options to try to bring down the price. Each new car can carry more weapons and armor, and is also faster.Weapons and armor can also be purchased between each race, as well as repairing any damage you have sustained. Prices vary between races, so there is a chance to gain money by using the weapons as commodities and trading with them. Some weapons have changed from the last game, and you now also have a button to select which weapon to fire while racing.In addition several special events with similar mini-games as with the car dealer will appear between each race in the management mode (and there are several new events compared to the last game).The core of the game, the race itself, takes place on various road courses with tunnels, jumps, railway crossings and gates that open and close. Though the game is an arcade racer, the cars behave somewhat realistically, with power-slides in corners and spin-outs when crashing (which is new to this game). All cars also leave skid marks and craters when they explode, which means that the track looks quite battle worn at the end of a race.In addition to racing against the computer players, you can also race against a friend using a split screen mode.</plot>

  <plot>The year is 1953. When Steve Mason awakens in the quiet North American town called Harvest, he cannot remember anything. People claim to know him and even to be related to him, but he does not recall their names. As he explores the strange town, he encounters more and more eccentric people, whose behavior is difficult to explain. Everyone keep telling him that he should join the Lodge, the headquarters of the mysterious Order of the Harvest Moon. Steve is determined to find out the truth about the town and about himself, but he doesn&apos;t know that this truth is more horrifying than he could have ever imagined...Harvester is essentially a point-and-click, puzzle-solving adventure game. Though a weapon-shaped icon allows the player to attack characters, this can only be done as a solution to a puzzle, in order to advance the game&apos;s plot at specific points. The largest bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to traditional adventure activities: talking to characters and manipulating inventory items to solve puzzles. &quot;Hot spots&quot; indicate interaction possibilities, as in most adventure games of that period. The game features video cut scenes with live actors; for gameplay portions, digitized animations of the actors are super-imposed over pre-rendered background graphics.</plot>

  <plot>You are Shuji Yamagami, a sixteen-year-old Japanese boy, and this is your first day at the Kotobuki Preparatory School, where most of the student are already eighteen or older. It&apos;s not easy to be a new student, and it is also not easy to make a closer acquaintance with one of the many attractive girls who study together with you...Seasons of Sakura is a manga/hentai interactive story, which can hardly be called &quot;adventure&quot; due to a complete lack of puzzles or other challenges. The story proceeds as you go to different places, meet different characters and talk to them. The gameplay and the interface are quite similar to those of Three Sister&apos;s Story, developed by the same company. There are several options at each screen, including &quot;think&quot; option. The view is 1st person perspective, with still pictures of locations and characters (mostly girls ;)) Needless to say there are many explicit erotic scenes in the game.</plot>

  <plot>As a follow-up to Legend of the Red Dragon, a game that burst at its seams with derivative borrowing, no one was expecting such a radical departure in approach and style as they got in New World -- something akin to an unwholesome marriage of Ultima, ZZT and Habitat, a realtime multiplayer BBS door effectively amounting to a roguelike MUD with a huge sandbox for free play alone (even locally) or with all your friends.A massive world map permits movement between numerous cities and regions and involvement in their respective political intrigues (and outright military campaigns!) against each other; alternately, a player wishing to fish on the end of the dock or collect berries for Mom to bake into pie can happily play on that scale as long as they like. There&apos;s no shortage of quests (especially with the option to include user-contributed in-game modules) and no lack of opportunities to increase experience through the slaying of random encounters. On the other hand if you prefer you can just sit around the tavern or picnic blanket and chew the fat with your buddies, exchanging comments and trading curious items acquired in your journeys.</plot>

  <plot>Edward Grabowski&apos;s The Blue and the Gray gives you your chance to fight the American Civil War. You control either the federal (blue) or Confederate (gray) army, starting in July 1861. You have four years to defeat the other side by capturing the opposition&apos;s cities and winning military conflicts. Play takes place at two levels: first, you move your divisions across a map of America in a turn based game at the campaign level: then when two forces meet, a Micro Miniatures battle takes place with the result having its affect on the campaign level. This game gives you the chance to rewrite history, by choosing the course that the war will take. The computer uses histroical records to determine the recruitment of forces and availability of weapons over time, so that both sides have approzimately the same &quot;raw material&quot; that they did in the real war. Whether you win or lose depends on how you use them.</plot>

The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can&apos;t shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</plot>

  <plot>The Kingdom of Azeroth was relatively peaceful and ruled by King Llane. That was until a powerful mage named Medivh commanded forces that opened up a portal in the Swamp of Sorrow, leading to another world. This ushered in the Age of Chaos, as Orcs were summoned to this world and attempted to establish an empire. As the Orcish hordes swarmed from the portal, they met with the Humans of Azeroth and battles ensured. Peaceful co-existence is not an option. Only one race will attain dominance over the land.Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans is the first real-time fantasy strategy game from Blizzard Entertainment. By playing either the Humans or the Orcs in this saga, two separate story lines evolve with 12 scenarios per side telling the tale of the battle for Azeroth. Players must mine gold and chop wood in order to construct buildings and create new units. From swords to sorcery, all the elements of classic fantasy are here to explore: rich forests, dark dungeons and bubbling swamps await the stalwart troops amassed to fight for dominance. Command many unique armies and creatures including Knights, Archers, Clerics, Warlocks, Daemons, Elementals, and Necromancers who are able to raise the dead.The multiplayer aspects of the game allow 2 players to challenge one another on over 20 custom maps and determine who is the supreme warlord. Head to head play is supported over modem, serial link, and IPX networks, and works cross-platform between the IBM-PC and Macintosh versions.</plot>

You too are sucked in, and soon become one of the Chosen - the most favored worshippers of the evil god, Tchernobog. But one day, Tchernobog inexplicably kills the four Chosen, including you; mysteriously resurrected years later, you are out to get revenge, and learn why your lord cast you down so abruptly.Ken Silverman&apos;s Build engine is the basis for what was possibly the goriest first-person shooter ever made up to this time. The environment is fully interactive, with moving floors and active vehicles. Destruction of landscapes is possible (although only in specific spots), and bullet holes being left by misplaced shots. The Build engine is 2.5D, so there are rooms above rooms and puzzles which are based on this.People explode violently when taken out, to the point that you can use a zombie&apos;s head like a football. Impaled victims can be found lying around, and people die in different ways depending on how they are attacked and in which part of their body.The game consists of four episodes, each one containing a set of maps that have to be traversed by our hero in order. The levels are usually realistic-looking structures (such as a carnival - complete with twisted attractions - or a city district). Throughout the levels, you need to find keys (up to 6 in a level) and switches in order to make your way to the exit. On the way, you&apos;ll meet a variety of enemies, such as zombies that tend to come back to life after killed, cultists armed with shotguns and tommy guns that shout in pseudo-Latin language, crawling hands that attempt to choke you, or hell-hounds that can set you on fire with their breath, and many more. To defend yourself against this menace, you can find a variety of weapons: a pitchfork; a flare gun that can set enemies on fire; a sawed-off shotgun; a tommy gun; a napalm launcher; TNT bundles which come in three different varieties; a home-made flamethrower made of an aerosol can; a tesla cannon that electrocutes your victims; a magical staff dubbed the &quot;Life Leech&quot;; and a voodoo doll. There are items to pick up strewn around. Unlike other games, your health is not replenished via medikits, but by &quot;Life Essences&quot;, heart-like powerups randomly dropped by enemies upon their death. It is also possible to find armor, which comes in three different varieties - Physical, Fire, and Spiritual, each one defending you from different attacks. There are also other powerups; some (such as Jumping Shoes or Doctor&apos;s Bag) can be picked up and activated at any time, while others (such as Partial Invisibility) activate immediately when you take them.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the Disney movie of the same name, The Black Cauldron focuses on the story of Taran, who is an assistant Pig-keeper in the land of Caer Dalben. One day Taran notices that one of his pigs, Hen Wen has magical powers. The Evil Horned King wants the pig so that he can locate the Black Cauldron and ultimately rule the world. Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before his can discover the Cauldron&apos;s location.The Black Cauldron is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as Space Quest II or King&apos;s Quest III) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.</plot>

  <plot>The game is based on the Shannara fantasy novels by Terry Brooks. The protagonist of the game is Jak Ohmsford, whose father, Shea, is a legendary hero who once defeated the evil warlock Brona. The druid Allanon tells Jak that Brona has returned, and only way to defeat him - beside wielding the legendary sword of Shannara - is to travels to the lands of different races populating the world, and convince them to put their differences aside and join forces to defeat Brona. On his long journey, Jak will meet many characters from different races, and embrace his heroic destiny by making the toughest decisions of his life.Shannara is an adventure game with the same interface as Death Gate, derived from earlier interactive fiction games by Legend Entertainment. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the navigation (beside traveling on the world map) is done by &quot;jumping&quot; from screen to screen, rather than by physically moving the protagonist. The game has inventory-based puzzles and extended conversation trees with many dialogue options.The game has some elements taken from RPGs, such as top-down world-map traveling and occasional turn-based battles. However, there is no real RPG system in the game (statistics, experience points, levels, etc.). The battles serve to emphasize the danger of traveling the wilderness, or appear as story-related events; sometimes, they are treated like puzzles, with specific actions leading to victory.Although the main playable character is Jak Ohmsford, other characters travel with the hero, forming a &quot;party&quot;. These characters have their own inventory and abilities, which must be used sometimes to solve the game&apos;s puzzles.</plot>

  <plot>Starting this game will remind you of Pipe Dream, but the gameplay is a bit different. You will still make a pipe using various pipe pieces that appear. However, you don&apos;t get points for how long your pipe goes or how many times you overlap the pipe. Instead, you get points for how many loops you can make. If you complete a loop, it will disappear and you will get points for it.There is a timer that will continue to go down which makes the game more of a challenge. The timer can be increased a lot by completing loops, or a little by placing pieces.</plot>

  <plot>In the year 2012, Foreign Terrorists led by the infamous Victor Baloch have taken control of the Twin &quot;U.N towers&quot; in the United States of America, capturing the leaders of the world who were holding a summit at the time.As a member of the Governments &quot;Elite Force&quot;, trained to take out terrorists when the talking stops, you must enter one of the towers through its maintenance area, which can be accessed through the sewers.OBC has 40 levels with the first 5 taking place in the sewers where the player, strangely, fights off giant rats and mutants the manual calls Sludge Minions before they enter the first tower to take on the terrorists.The weapons available to the player include a shotgun with infinite ammo, an Uzi, Galil, Flame Thrower and Grenade Launcher (though it functions like a Rocket Launcher).The aim of each level in OBC is to kill a certain number of terrorists on a map before using one of several elevators or stairs to go up to the next floor.OBC pioneered many features including controllable allies (the other members of your squad that join you once you enter the tower). You can order them to follow you or to roam the floor killing all they find. The player can also freely jump between their bodies in the games take on a lives system; as long as the team member they are in isn&apos;t killed there is no limit on this.OBC also features a near fully destructible environment; the Flame Thrower can set bad guys, scenery and the level itself on fire, which could make movement extremely hazardous for the player, especially as the fire randomly spreads. The Grenade launcher meanwhile can destroy any wall (with some hard coded exceptions).Like Blake Stone OBC also features textured floors and ceilings. Though unlike Blake, OBC could have several different floor textures on the same map. However OBC&apos;s floor/ceiling graphics were partially parallax meaning they appeared to &quot;warp&quot; as the player moves around.</plot>

  <plot>A charming piece of hyperfiction masquerading as a rare romantic text adventure game about a big date with what could be Mr. Right! Choose-your-own-adventure interaction spins the customized player along whimsical tangents but ultimately all plot forks either lead to dead ends or rejoin the fixed-rail central narrative. Little replay value is intended, but manic and wacky energy drive even the second chances resulting from the selection of &quot;obviously wrong&quot; choices, all while skewering conventions of the romance genre. In short, something to cleanse the palate with once a year the morning of February 14th.</plot>

  <plot>The game is a computer adaptation of an American TV game show, where two competitors should win a game and money, throwing dices, eliminating certain numbers and answering trivial questions.The gameplay flows in real-time mode. For each roll of the dice a question must be answered. The first player should press his/her keys to have a chance to answer the question. If the first player to hit their key answers correctly, then he or she have control of the dice and may decide whether to roll them or pass them to the other player. If however the first player to answer answers incorrectly, then the other player has control of the dice and may roll or pass.In the one player game, you compete against the computer. In novice mode the computer plays less intelligently than in expert mode and responds incorrectly to questions more often. The two player game follows the same format as one player game, but with both human opponents playing at hot-seat.The object of the game is to clear the columns of numbers thus winning the money total at the bottom of the column (if you win the game). In order to take numbers off the board you must answer a question correctly or be passed the dice. You roll the dice trying not to roll a total that doesn&apos;t equal some of the remaining numbers on the board. For example if there are only three numbers left on the board it is probably a good idea to pass the dice since there are quite a few illegal rolls. For every Doubles you roll, you get an insurance marker which allows you to roll illegally without losing the game (but only once). You can take off 1,2,3 or 4 numbers from the board at one time.Winning the competition, Bonus Round will be proposed to a player. Its idea is to clear all of the numbers off of the board, without rolling an illegal combination (without an insurance marker). If a player achieves the goal, he/she get an additional $10,000! After a player completes the bonus round he/she become the current champion and subsequent players must play him/her until they defeat him/her. But the current champion does not appear in the High Rollers Champions file until he/she loses.Hi-scores are written in Top Ten Table.</plot>

  <plot>Pulse is an interesting game where you try to get a group of pieces of the same color together similar to how you would in a tetris game. However, in this game, the pieces are flying around all over the place and you have to &quot;attract&quot; them to where you want them.As you get a set of four or more of a color of disks completed, those pieces disappear and you get a spiky piece of that color. Every set of disks of a color completed gets a new spiky piece. Clearing a set of spiky pieces gets a triangle piece, and clearing a set of those gets a star piece. This is kind of like going up in levels.As you progress, you can get power-ups and special events. Due to the number of pieces flying around as you progress, this game becomes very fast-paced and difficult the further you get into the game.</plot>

Ball carrier AI was upgraded, and the game shipped with about one thousand stock plays (many times the size of the original game&apos;s playbook.)On-field graphics were also touched upon: this game uses the same graphics engine as its predecessor, but features more animations including spins and flips, and tweaked camera angles (including one new angle plus a blimp&apos;s-eye view) for better visibility and a more cinematic feel.</plot>

You are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will track the bugs and hopefully stop them.The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting æENÆ symbols will restore your energy, and æIQÆ symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.The single-player game gives you three lives, plus another when you complete each of the 50 levels. The multi-player game can be played in 2 different ways û co-operative (work together to clear the computer of bugs) or competitive (Dynablaster-style free-for-all destruction).</plot>

  <plot>Rings of Zilfin is an unusual, but relatively unknown early fantasy solo RPG by Ali N. Atabek, who went on to create the Magic Candle series. It was meant for beginners to computer RPGs, featuring no character creation, simple game play and movie-like cut scenes, concentrating more on atmosphere than on character stats.The background: Long ago, the Zilfins (mighty wizards) established an enchanted realm of peace and property in Batiniq. They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing some innate magical ability. In the introduction, Reis barely escapes Dragos&apos; minions, and leaves his home village. After &quot;character creation&quot; (giving Reis an optional other name and selecting one of 10 difficulty levels, which affect your starting resources), you start your quest to find the Zilfins and their second ring and to develop your magical abilities on the way.The game features a huge world with over 100 villages and towns in four kingdoms. Each town has up to three buildings you can enter -- shops with items to buy and sell, inns to eat and drink and rest, amongst others --, and also people you can talk to (careful, some are shape shifters!), sometimes offering valuable information. There are also a few dungeons and some caves to explore, but most of the game is played in towns or travelling between them.When leaving a location, the game shows a map where you can select the direction off your next target. While travelling between locations, the game shows an interesting side scrolling view. You can set your walking speed, which influences your fatigue, and stop when you encounter pools or plants. Pools can be drunk from (may have positive or negative effects), and the plants can be gathered and eaten later. Some plants have special effects, there are &quot;magic mushrooms&quot; and some other healing and boosting plants. This plant system is one of the things that distinguishes this game.While travelling, you may also encounter Lord Dragos&apos; minions, which results in some pseudo-real time combat. The monsters are often quite unusual, like Barvils (mutated bats), Basurs (flying skulls) or Zumagin (the death ray demon). Protected by different armors, you can attack with arrows or swords or by casting spells. The game makes a difference between ground-based and air-bourne monsters -- the latter cannot be attacked with swords, of course.The spell system is quite simple. There are three spell levels: Apprentice, Master and Grand Master, each one lets you know more and more powerful spells. Casting a spell always costs some fatigue, and you have to prepare the spell first. The game is highly non-linear and there are several approaches possible. For example, it is possible to make money by trading, buying cheap items in one town and selling them in another town -- which, in fact, is the only way to make money in the beginning. All commands are given by pressing keys, like &quot;G&quot; for getting things or &quot;C&quot; for casting spells. The game may be saved when exiting towns and loaded at the main menu.</plot>

  <plot>Breach is a turn-based tactical squad combat game. It introduces the team-oriented missions, RPG-style squad leader development and excellent scenario builder that would grow to be trademarks and would be refined in the sequels Breach 2 and Breach 3.In the ten missions supplied with the retail version (and potentially infinitely more created with the included scenario builder), a squad of usually five space marines under the command of a squad leader embarks on sci-fi missions that involve hostage rescue, data retrieval or simply elimination of opponents. Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields.In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.</plot>

To survive, you must determine your location and hike to the safety of the outpost.The game provides six different information screens to aid you in your journey. The View screen shows a three-dimensional panorama of your immediate surroundings. The Topo screen is a two-dimensional map of the 90x67 mile area where you have crashed. Your first job is to figure out where you are on the map. In the View screen you can type commands (e.g., LOOK RIGHT, LOOK UP, PAN LEFT) to help orient yourself on the surrounding terrain.The Status and Inventory screens give you reports on your physical condition and survival gear, respectively. The Help and Clue screens give you survival advice and hints, if you want them, but cost you points.When you are ready to set out, you issue travel commands (e.g., WALK FOR 20 MINUTES) which move you in the direction you are facing (the View screen is redrawn when you reach your next location). To survive, you must also make use of your inventory and things in your environment.

Each player controls one color of balls--either red or green.Like checkers, the game board is an eight-by-eight grid. Unlike checkers&apos;s squares, though, Funball&apos;s bases don&apos;t just passively accept balls. Bases can change a ball&apos;s size, teleport it, spring it further along, cause it to slide past rather than land, or have numerous other effects--there are thirteen different types of bases. The arrangement of the different kinds of bases isn&apos;t always the same, either. When starting a new game, the player can choose from five different preset boards, or use the board editor to create a custom board.Not only are there different types of bases, the balls themselves can be different sizes. The relative sizes of the balls determines the outcome of an attack, and can have other effects, depending on the target base. In addition to the balls, the board can contain a spider, which moves around the board each turn, and can lay eggs that balls can absorb to grow larger.The game can be played against the computer, or against a friend in hotseat mode.</plot>

Player animations are fluid and realistic, and the player sprites have clearly visible jersey numbers and names. The game also boasts a historic simulation mode. Players can choose among 50 different classic NFL game situations and try to rewrite history. Imagine...it&apos;s December 23, 1973. The Dallas Cowboys are down 28-13 to the 49ers. With under a minute remaining, the Boys score a touchdown and recover an onside kick. Can you complete one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history?</plot>

In her quest for power and revenge Scotia accidentally set into motion the revival of Belial, God of Evil. Now that she&apos;s dead, it&apos;s up to you to clean up the mess left behind and stop Belial from reviving and doing all sorts of naughty things to the world.You are not without help... with her dying breath Scotia gave Luther her mighty powers of shapeshifting, but through an error Luther received the powers in a damaged formed: he cannot control when he changes or what he changes into. Things aren&apos;t easy for Luther. Not only is he cursed with his mother&apos;s power, but the people of the Lands are understandably upset with Scotia and will attempt to take their frustration out on Luther. But with his mother&apos;s magic and a little help from the Draracle (another god and Belial&apos;s parole officer) Luther just might be able to fulfill his destiny and stop Belial.</plot>

Through your struggles, you will find yourself again and again betrayed by friends and allies, your parents will be killed and you will have to return to points you&apos;ve already been to (with variations on the levels) in order to remove further threats to the galaxy and to yourself, all for the ultimate goal of overthrowing MicroSol.Tyrian also has two player arcade mode and supports network/modem/serial play.

Between voyages, you&apos;ll have to buy and outfit ships and hire men to crew them. As in the original 7COG, you can play at three different skill levels, and choose to explore either the historical map (consisting of the Americas at the time of Columbus&apos; journeys) or a land form randomly generated by the game.As befitting a &quot;Commemorative Edition,&quot; the PC version of 7COG has been beefed up with hi-res graphics and digitized sound. 7COG is a rare example of a game being completely redeveloped for a specific platform instead of merely being ported over. (However, Seven Cities of Gold did in fact come out natively for the PC in the mid 1980s. --Ed.)</plot>

  <plot>CM2 is a football (known as soccer to some of you) management sim. Released fall 1995 as the successor of a fine line of various versions of the original Championship Manager, CM2 soon established itself as the benchmark game for football management sims. And it&apos;s still highly popular. Despite the fact that the game consists purely of statistics and tables and no graphics at all, it&apos;s extremely addictive, and you cannot avoid not getting hooked if you&apos;re a footie fanatic. Boasting endless features and an enormous depth, CM2 is just like managing an own, personal football team from the comfort of your own living room. Literally every famous and semi-famous player from all around the globe is featured, and it&apos;s of course possible to transfer players to and from your squad in your neverending quest for the ultimate line-up. The game is controlled by solely using the mouse, and the menus don&apos;t contain icons or any flashy graphics -- it rather goes for informative and in-your-face text boxes, CM-style. During matches, explanatory text explains you what happens through use of the same text boxes, and you can of course modify your team just like you want to, and use the tactics of your choice. If you find that playing with only the English and Scottish leagues somewhat weakens your interest, you&apos;ll be pleased to discover that several foreign add-ons or stand-alone games are available. Once you get addicted, you&apos;ll find that you&apos;ll spend enormous amounts of time in front of your pc, and you&apos;ll get somewhat disappointed when you discover that it&apos;s impossible to play any further than 2025.

Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.&amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.&amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</plot>

The amount of points you get depends on how you hit them ... e.g. you get more points for getting them do a 360 other than driving into theirs sides at high speed.

  <plot>As Lemmings spawned its annual Holiday Lemmings specials, so too the Lemmings parody Lamers yielded this festive spin-off. Following the Lamers premise of AI-controlled Lemming-like Lamers (here dressed in Santa suits) securing their own safe passage through a hostile landscape toward a computer for them to muck up, the task before the player is to use all tools available to thwart them. With more seasonal hazards to employ than the conventional arms featured in its predecessor, here the player deploys limited amounts of Christmas toys and cruel factors of the winter weather -- snowballs and buckets of ice water. Will nothing drive away these Lamers?</plot>

  <plot>This arcade game is a cross between Breakout and Space Invaders. Player controls an electromechanical robot, who walks along the top of a wall consisting of bricks and jumps on it. A line of bugs is coming to him from the bottom of the screen in vertical direction, while the bomb is flying in horizontal direction in the center. Bugs may be killed by jumping on the wall, which results in a brick falling from its bottom. The number of jumps is equal to the bottom brick&apos;s distance from the robot. Flying bomb may eliminate the brick until it reaches the bug, but if the bug is killed, its bad or good soul will fly to the top, where robot may collect it and make influence on his mood. After the bug is eliminated, another one will start to crawl from the bottom. There is a snail moving in horizontal direction at the very bottom of the screen, which is mostly covered by the bugs crawling to the top, and it may be hit by brick in case of success also. The player is transferred to another level after necessary quantity of the bugs is killed. But beware! Robot&apos;s energy is exhausted, when bug is crawling upon him, and the robot becomes non-functional if the bugs reached the very top of the screen or if the robot falls off the wall.</plot>

Instead of offering several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It&apos;s possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</plot>

  <plot>WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the popular WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret &quot;Hit Man&quot; Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</plot>

To accomplish this goal, the player can move orthogonally or by using Chess-style knight moves. To make things more challenging, the player has a limited number of moves in each direction (which varies from level to level and by difficulty setting). Additionally, some puzzle squares contain stop signs (which force the player to start over) or arrows (which automatically move the player to another square).

  <plot>Realms of the Haunting is a very interesting combination of first-person shooter and three-dimensional adventure game with quite a bit of live-action Full Motion Video thrown in to boot. Navigation through the game world is done through a FPS interface very similar to Doom, however there&apos;s also a free-floating cursor controlled by the mouse which you can use to interact with the various objects around you.There&apos;s also an inventory system and quite a few object related puzzles. The game has standard Doom-ish combat against a variety of monsters, however the combat is placed at intervals rather than throughout the game, and the emphasis is more on exploration and atmosphere.Realm&apos;s of the Haunting&apos;s plot starts out as a typical haunted house story but soon mutates into an end-of-the-world tale combining New Age pseudo-philosophy and biblical Revelations. You take the part of Adam Randall, a pastor&apos;s son who is sent to investigate a haunted mansion by a mysterious priest who claims it&apos;s linked to your father&apos;s death. Once you enter the mansion you soon learn that not only is it infested with demons and evil spirits, but that the mansion itself is built over an old Satanic temple and the priest who sent you there is in fact a five-hundred year old French sorceror trying to bring about the end of the world.You are soon joined by a helpful young psychic and aided by the ghost of a defeated knight. You&apos;ll also start a grudge with an ex-demonking as well as be chased around by the Antichrist-in-training. Instead of plain English, all these characters are compelled to speak in cryptic pseudo-mystical mumbo-jumbo, but even so they somehow seem to get across the point that you&apos;re some kind of Chosen One who&apos;s supposed to sort out the whole sorry mess. Things gets even more surreal as you travel to different realms of existence via gateways located in the mansion, chat with a variety of supernatural entities via FMV sequences, learn the real secret behind life the universe and everything, and of course do your darndest to stop or at least delay Armaggedon.</plot>

  <plot>Strike Aces is a flight simulator designed to give players a feel for the quick decision-making process that real pilots need to fly. It takes place at the Strategic Air Command Bombing and Navigation Competition, a real-life event that occurs every year at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. The best aircrews from around the world and some of the best aircraft come to participate in a series of three missions that are constantly monitored, with points awarded to aircrews in various categories. In the end, the aircrew that has gained the post points receives the Curtis E. LeMay trophy. In this game, you are the pilot of one of these aircrews with a choice of flying one of six aircraft, and your missions will pit you against any of seven additional enemy aircraft (although you will not get to fly them). To practice flying, you can do a Free Flight; when you&apos;re ready to compete, you will get to complete a series of 16 missions. You can also design your own missions, if you like.</plot>

  <plot>Dracula in London is a board game / adventure game based on the classic horror novel by Bram Stoker. Tired of his ancient and barren homeland in Romania, Dracula has come to London seeking fresh blood. He has already bitten and transformed Lucy Westerna into a vampiress, forcing the six remaining main characters to destroy her. Players take control of the six survivors and must track down and destroy the evil count before he can claim another victim.Dracula in London can be played as either a board game with multiple players controlling different hunters, or as an adventure game with a single player controlling all six characters. Each character has their own special abilities, for example John Harker is the only character able to follow up on clues, and Dr. Steward is the only character able to pick locks as well as calm down asylum inmate Reinfield if the madman should get out of control and attack your hunters.In order to locate the vampire&apos;s lairs, you must investigate local going-ons in London for signs of the count&apos;s presence. Once a lair has been found, you can equip your hunters with items and sacred weapons and explore the infested estates for the count and his places of rest. If you are unable to track Dracula down, he will flee to his family castle in Transylvania, and you can give chase for a final battle. But if you fail to destroy all his places of rest, there is a chance the count will escape and all your suffering will be for naught.The highly random nature of the game ensures a different experience each time. The five or six locations in London are randomly generated, and can contain clues to be followed, coffins to be destroyed, vermin to be fought in combat, and even encounters with the evil count himself. Also, many different random events often occur which can influence the course of the game. Hunters may be stricken with illness, forced to visit an ailing relative, or arrested by the police for breaking and entering. The madman Reinfield may slaughter your hunters at Dracula&apos;s command, or he could become the unlikely hero who shows up at the final battle and dispatchs the count for you. One of your characters, Mina, may be targeted by the count, and if you fail to protect her Dracula will transform her into a bloodthirsty vampiress.</plot>

Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, &quot;Dial-A-Combo&quot; attacks, a &quot;Run&quot; button to speed up the battles, and &quot;Vs. codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens.

  <plot>Based around a classic motor car race from either side of the war, 1000 Miglia (literally &apos;1000 miles&apos;) is an unusual racing game. You have to progress across Italy through a number of stages in your rickety 20s car. Keeping within time limits at each point is crucial to staying in the game. At the beginning of the game, you can choose the spare parts that you will take with yourself in case your car breaks down. You also choose a car and set up the skills for your two drivers; you can distribute points between Skill, Resistance and Mechanics, and choose the driver&apos;s favorite part of the race. Atmospheric conditions change throughout the race: sometimes the weather will be clear, sometimes you&apos;ll have to drive through rain or mist. During the race, your car will sometimes lose a wheel or need other repairs. If this happens, you&apos;ll lose a couple of minutes repairing it - as long as you have the appropriate spare part; if you don&apos;t have one, it&apos;s game over!</plot>

  <plot>Your father, the loved Duke of Allada was last night murdered by Orcish hordes and same Orcs have come again to invade your city. Now is the time to avenge your father and keep well the title Duke of Allada. Recruit an army and prepare for the upcoming onslaught! The future and fate of Allada and its role in Aragon now rests in your hands!Sword of Aragon is a turned-based fantasy strategy game where you rule a small town called Allada in the North Western part of the land known as Aragon. Most of the political map is yet undiscovered and you have to maintain a strong economy and military force to venture forth. The storyline revolves around your duties as the Duke of Allada, exploring the uncharted areas of Aragon and uncovering its mysteries, conquering neighboring cities, as well as the political intrigues surrounding the city-states of Aragon. In Sword of Aragon, you can choose one of the 5 different character classes for your leading hero, each with different bonuses to your troops and abilities: Warrior, Knight, Ranger, Priest, or Mage. Different selection of character class does not affect the storyline.GameplayGameplay of Sword of Aragon consists of 3 major categories:1. City and Resource Development and ManagementWith Allada as the first city you control (though later in the game you may acquire many other cities in the land of Aragon), the first rule of business is developing your town and creating a steady economy. Military development and maintenance costs money and unless those Orcs come again with more friends, you had better maintain a decent military garrison. The only way to get money is to tax the revenues of your city. These revenues come from 5 different sectors: Farming, Lumber, Mining, Commerce, and Manufacturing. The stronger the sector, the higher your tax income. You can do this by investing money to selected sectors which strengthens your economy (and your city happiness) as well as promoting more people to come to your city and well as a steady stable birthrate (more people means more taxes!)Besides developing resources, you can also invest in structures and fortifications. Aragon is fantasy world filled with mystery and monsters, a town without walls is inviting inevitable disaster from marauding enemies. Structures and fortification investment guarantee thick walls and battlements for your troops to defend themselves in the event of an attack. Structures also have an additional use of storing surplus food for those harsh winter days.You can also recruit military units and heroes at cities. Military units and heroes may only be recruited providing you have the money as well as available recruits at the selected city. Recruits increase through time although you may also conscript citizens, however it will have a negative effect to your city happiness.Military Development and CombatYou start the game preparing for combat. Thus, recruiting an army is the first priority in the game. There are different types of military units as wells as heroes that you can recruit: Infantry, Cavalry, Bowmen, and Mounted Bowmen. The more experience your troops obtain (either from training or combat) the stronger they become as well as able to equip more various selections of armor and weapons. Heroes can be recruited to up to 20 units (yourself included). Heroes, though weak at the beginning of the game, provide backup combat bonuses for your troops (especially Warrior, Knights and Rangers) as well as devastating offense magic and beneficial support magic (Rangers, Priests and Mages).The combat screen generally consists of the combat terrain and military units: Your hero and your main forces, the opponentsÆ main forces, as well as the allies of either side (when applicable). There is no time limit on combat - it ends when either side is annihilated or withdraws from battle.Exploring and Random EventsAt the start of the game, you can view Allada and its surroundings, particularly the Northern areas. The Southern and Eastern maps remain unexplored by your map makers. Exploring will uncover set and random events which will progress the overall story.</plot>

  <plot>Similar to Speedball 2 in many ways, this is an ultra-violent sports game. Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into a goal at each end, guarded by a net-minder. The ball can be thrown or kicked, and is an oval, resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks. The gameplay is fast and flowing, and has one rule - if you can&apos;t get the ball, get the man, and decapitate him if possible. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises to slow him down. Teams consist of humans and aliens, many of which have their own unique skills. There&apos;s a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge.

  <plot>Baron Baldric is quite known among Apogee fans - but the main character, Baron Baldric, was later reused for an isometric game called Mystic Towers. It is considered very rare since the registered version was only sold in the Australian territory.The story behind Baron Baldric: A Grave Overture takes place under Castle Pedabouch. You have to search for the family treasures in the tomb: it was told that, centuries before, Baron Baldric&apos;s ancestor, Baron Lazarus Pedabouche studied an evil Wolf-Magic and turned into a cruel tyrant: fortunately, when he seized Rosie, a local milk-maid, he was stoned to death by his own subjects. Rosie died too, and was doomed to haunt the whole castle until the ancient baron was slain.A Grave Overture reminds of classics like Impossible Mission 2 and the earlier Montezuma&apos;s Revenge because of many elements bringing the game far from the action genre. You have to find flints to light lamps when they go out, and regularly eat food to survive the maze.</plot>

  <plot>Push Your Luck is a version of a classic dice game. Each round, you roll two dice as &quot;blockers. Then roll five dice as long as you wish, getting the number of points each die shows. The catch is if you roll the same number as one of the blockers (it&apos;s possible, but unlikely, for both blockers to be the same number), you don&apos;t get points for that die and can no longer roll it. If you keep rolling until you roll all blockers, you get zero points for that round. You may stop at any time. There are a total of five rounds. The player with the highest total for the game wins.For example, assume 2 and 5 are your blockers. On your first roll, you roll 3, 5, 4, 1, and 3. You get 11 points (3 + 4 + 1 + 3) and the die you rolled a 5 on is removed from play. Your next roll, you roll 2, 3, 5, and 5. Your total is now 14 (11 + 3), but you&apos;ve only got one die left to roll. This is a good time to stop! (Don&apos;t push your luck too much.)The game was designed for PC/XT/AT computers with any kind of monitor. The graphics are made up of &quot;ANSI characters,&quot; which allow for a more colorful display than CGA would have. Simple sound is provided by the PC speaker.</plot>

After the heroes leave to escort the council member Sasha on a diplomatic assignment, the evil Lord Bane sends four of his most feared lieutenants to destroy the cities of Faerun and twist our dimension. The goal is clear: explore the land and rid it of the evil, by taking on Bane&apos;s minions one by one...Pools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box series of classic-style AD&amp;D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&amp;D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.The turn-based combat is done in similar style as other Gold Box games: the player navigates characters one by one on the top-down battle field, assigning various commands. Experience points are gained after successfully defeating enemies. Enemies appear randomly on the world map as well as in dungeons.</plot>

They must then use their combat strengths to defeat the other seven fighters followed by four boss characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has their own reasons for wanting to win against the others.Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depending on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the &quot;button combination&quot; style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight suplex.Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on gameplay and fighting games specifically can not be understated.

The first player is only able to move the marker horizontally, and the second player can only move the marker vertically. The board contains both negative and positive point values, so ideally you want to take a high, positive point value and force your opponent to take a negative value.

The game is broken into rounds which offer increasingly challenging puzzles; there is an optional Expert Mode which adds further difficulty to play. Each puzzle has a par, which is the number of steps the player is expected to need to complete a transformation. Breaking par causes a penalty to the score, while completing a puzzle quickly leads to a timer-related bonus. Players start the game with three lives, and lives are lost by running out of time or (in Expert Mode only) attempting to create an invalid word.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the 1989 Atari Games (not to be confused with Atari Corporation, producers of the Lynx) coin-op by Ed Rotberg. It&apos;s 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.Along the way you&apos;ll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</plot>

  <plot>In this sequel to Shadowlands, you find yourself commanding a team of explorers through a deserted space-station, trying to discover what happened to the crew. Along the way you must solve puzzles, fight baddies and do masses and masses of exploring.You have four characters to control in this real time RPG, and the designers have done their best to remove all the numbers usually involved in RPG&apos;s (dexterity/wisdom etc) and replaced them with friendlier looking graphical bars. Another good idea is the way you can put your characters in formation instead of having to move them one at a time. The other big innovative game system is the clever use of light: Teque&apos;s &quot;Photoscaping&quot; system which means you can only see a few feet in front of you and you can use flares and torches to light up areas.</plot>

  <plot>Kurtan is an old clone of Sokoban, developed by a joint US-Georgian (former USSR) venture. The game was widely circulated in the post-Soviet space. It comprises a series of puzzles that must be solved by moving all the randomly placed crates into their target spots. Some control issues exist where a single keystroke would cause the player character to move several spaces instead of one, making the game exceedingly challenging. The main character has been replaced with a stereotypical Georgian loader, and maze designs are slightly different than in the original. The game uses the 16 color high-res 640x350 EGA mode.</plot>

  <plot>Dark Forces marks LucasArts&apos; first attempt to enter the First Person Shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal &quot;Jedi&quot; engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle&apos;s ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.The player takes control of Kyle Katarn; an Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance. After a prologue mission where he steals the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his &quot;Dark Troopers&quot; - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.Dark Forces features 14 substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. Every level has objectives for Kyle to complete (rare, for First Person Shooters of the period), ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it. Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, and the game features Imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off, or directly replicating, John Williams&apos; original film score.Dark Forces is entirely a single-player campaign, and no multiplayer is included or supported.</plot>

  <plot>In Air Force Commander the player takes command of a Middle Eastern country&apos;s air force to gain air superiority over the enemy. Like the title suggests this game focuses solely on aircraft and rocket bases. The main part of the game is spent on the overhead map where the player gives orders to his units, e.g. attacking ground targets and scouting or intercepting enemy forces. Different map views show information like targets in range, flight movements in the monitored zones or civil facilities. Another important aspect of the game is resource management: every base and unit cost resources. If these get scarce the player can shut down some bases. If the public mood gets too bad, e.g. because of destroyed civil facilities or food shortage, the player loses his commission and therefore the game.</plot>

  <plot>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as &apos;flooz&apos; to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can&apos;t flow into, the pipe is finished.Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of &quot;Connect 4&quot;.</plot>

  <plot>Hexen is the sequel to Heretic. While the Heretic was destroying D&apos;Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic&apos;s innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.The hub system steps away from the traditional &quot;single levels stringed along into episodes&quot; system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen&apos;s hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single &quot;hub&quot; level through portals. There are also portals between some of the &quot;spoke&quot; levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.</plot>

  <plot>As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order. A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you&apos;re his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you&apos;ll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you&apos;ll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king&apos;s castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don&apos;t have enough for your army&apos;s salary, they will desert or turn against you.There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King&apos;s Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you&apos;re defeated, you respawn back at the king&apos;s castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.</plot>

  <plot>Depth Dwellers is a shareware first-person shooter. It was released as a one-part episode, with a total of three episodes in the registered version, and is fundamentally similar to id Software&apos;s Wolfenstein 3D in terms of game engine and play mechanics, and also offers an optional high-resolution video mode or stereographic mode for a 3D-glasses peripheral.In this sci-fi driven outing, the player takes on the role of a trained soldier, the son of Earth&apos;s diplomatic ambassador, secretly sent down to a planet which is in peril, known as &apos;Ora&apos;, where its inhabitants were enslaved by a tyrannical race known as the RI. They want to plunder the planets&apos; most rich resource, known only as &apos;Zendle&apos; at any cost, as its properties would assist greatly in the creation of a new weaponÆs system to ensure the RI&apos;s dominance of Ora, and ultimately all neighbouring planets. Each episode begins with the chapter storyline displayed in text format and your ultimate goal is also outlined here (it can incidentally be called upon during the course of the game). Gameplay elements include rescuing the slave Depth Dwellers, who appear chained to walls, mining shackled with pickaxes, or found wandering aimlessly through the labyrinths. You set them free through your advanced beaming transport technology which dematerializes and then rematerialises the poor souls to safety.Objective-driven scenarios are brought forward, such as in one instance, having to destroy a communications system to prevent the RI from calling upon reinforcements. Various other assignments are given during the course of each episode. In every level, your primary goal is to find one or more keys which grant access to a transporter room, taking you to the next stage.Collect new and increasingly powerful weapons from fallen enemies, or find them stashed in a plethora of secret areas. A rapid fire pulse laser, rocket launcher, flame thrower and a strategic mine dispensing armament, among other goodies become at your disposal as you delve deeper into the mines of the Depth Dwellers.</plot>

  <plot>Essentially similar to The Settlers AKA Serf City, Global Effect involves building up a sound local economy before going out to attack other nations and rule the world. Cities must contain housing, food sources and power supplies, which is where it gets complicated. You can choose the environmental settings of the game, in a similar way to Civilization - an icy world or a post-apocalyptic one make things much tougher.Environmental factors play the biggest part in this game, as you have to use efficient power sources if possible. You only get a certain level of power at the start of the game, and have to build enough &apos;green&apos; things to increase it further - trees are the most effective.Once you have a fully functional city capable of supporting military units of any quality, these can be directed off into battle by giving them pre-planned flight paths which can be over-ridden if need be.Two-player games can be played via null-modem cables, even across different systems.</plot>

Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien│) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</plot>

The gameplay follows closely the standards of this subgenre of fighting games: up to 2 players fight wave after wave of enemies, clearing the screen to move on, restoring their health by breaking objects that hide energy boosts, until reaching the final portion of each stage that ends with a boss battle. The buttons for each player (attack, jump, and special move) can be remapped at the options screen.</plot>

The gods are a real consideration in the decisions made and glorious death one of the highest goals. Unlike other strategy games, the building of the empire is not necessarily the ultimate objective.The player competes against other players to earn the favor of the Norse gods and become the Hammer of the Gods. The player can raid coastal villages, conquer cities and then link them together by building roads. Next, build castles to protect them. The particular path that the player follows to victory will vary based on the &quot;family&quot; of gods that is chosen at the beginning of the game. Maintaining honor in the eyes of the other Vikings is important throughout the game. The four paths are Human, Elf, Troll and Dwarf. Any of these may become Odin&apos;s chosen leader on Midgard by completing his quest and ensuring the player&apos;s place in legend.</plot>

  <plot>Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion (a.k.a Dave 2) is a sequel to original surprisingly successful Dangerous Dave. A rather a-typical platform game, in Dave 2 you run through a huge mansion with many different levels, battling all kinds of monsters and collecting items (yes, mostly bonus points). Every so-and-so points you get an additional life, and every so-and-so levels you combat a boss.One of the things that make this game unique is that instead of just having a limited amount of ammunition, you have a shotgun and can shoot 8 bullets at any given time. However, you must wait in order for Dave to reload his gun. This gives for some interesting scenes in which you frantically try to shoot your enemies and reload the gun just in time to shoot them again before they manage to kill you. Another thing that sets the game apart is the ability to aim your gun in several angles (generally: up, down or straight ahead), which again makes the game a great deal more interesting.</plot>

Astra is about to break down. The enemy race of Quadraliens has captured the reactor; now, contamination is rising and total failure is imminent. The last chance are six remotely controlled droids, which are to clean Astra and destroy the Quadrailen mother in Astras core.You&apos;re controlling two robots in each of the 19 levels, cleaning up the contamination on your way. Gameplay is a variation of Sokoban: You&apos;ve got to push spheres in the right direction to clear the way. However, the spheres are magnetically charged, meaning that they repell or attract each other. You&apos;ve got to consider chain reactions. Before entering a level, you may chose which robots to take with you. Each droid has different abilities, like higher range of movement, higher capacity to carry contaminated materials, or a magnetic charge of its own. You can blast your way out of hopeless situations with a limited number of detonators, and you may restart every level with already removed contamination staying removed. However, there&apos;s a time limit for the whole game in form of reactor core temperature and energy, so be quick!</plot>

  <plot>Inordinate Desire is a turn-based strategy game with action elements. As commander of a spaceship carrier you have to conquer foreign planets.Every day is represented by a round. In the beginning of a round you are in your carrier and have these options: Buy new units, send pilots on patrol, repair ships and look at statistics. When this is taken care of you use your spaceship and fly to the planet. There you can give orders to your units and tell them to move or shoot. Yes, move or shoot - a unit can&apos;t do both in one round. Because you can&apos;t see the condition of the hostile units you have to act blindly. Additionally you can build deposits and radar units on the planet. The deposits are used to repair damaged units and with the radar units you start air strikes - but the radius is low, so you are more likely to kill your own troops.At the end of the round all your orders get evaluated. Sometimes your carrier gets attacked by one hostile spaceship. Then you have to kill the attacker in a simple action sequence similar to Wing Commander: You sit in a spaceship and shoot rockets.</plot>

  <plot>Alien Breed is a top-down science fiction shooter somewhat inspired by the movie Alien in terms of plot and atmosphere. Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction. Other major bonuses found on the floor are emergency kits for restoring your health, and credits. The credits come in handy when you find an Infotex terminal. There, you can access information about your current mission and your vital statistics, as well as buy supplies such as ammunition, weapons and keys.Music is forfeited in this game, in favour of ambience sounds from machinery, machine gun sounds and the sounds of the aliens running around the base.</plot>

  <plot>An updated version of White Wolf&apos;s earlier Empire game, which was based on a wargame dating back to early mainframe days. One to six players (human or computer with three levels of intelligence) compete to conquer the world using their ground, air, and sea units.There are three versions of the game available: basic, standard, and advanced. The basic game provides the minimal types of units, a completely viewable map, and basic production rules. The standard game adds some new units, forces you to explore the map to view it, and slightly modifies the production rules. Finally, the advanced game (for the true wargamer) adds even more types of units, terrain effects on movement and sighting, and slightly more complicated production rules.In addition to playing one or more people around the same computer, you could play via mail (by posting disks back and forth), e-mail, modem, network, or direct serial link.The game also came with some preset scenarios and maps for players to use. Additionally, there was an editor that let players create their own maps and scenarios.Copy protection was a compromise between security and player convenience. Rather than looking up a word in the manual every time the game was run, this was only required when running the separate executable that set game options. (Screen resolution, sound options, etc.) Naturally, you always had to run it before playing the first time.White Wolf and New World Computing also released a scenario disk for the game and later released the Windows version with the extra scenarios on CD-ROM.</plot>

Each level is a long, winding road along which the car drives, facing various enemy vehicles coming at him from the opposite direction. Close contact with the edges of the road or with the enemies will result in destruction. The car is equipped with a laser cannon with which to destroy the opponents. There are a couple of pick-ups that can be found on the way: a weapon upgrade, a bonus that allows the car to destroy enemies by running into them, a bomb that instantly clears the screen of enemies, and three types of shields: a rotation shield (it orbits the car and destroys bad guys on contact), a side shield (prevents the car from destruction from the edges of the road) and a forward shield (destroys enemies in front of the car).</plot>

  <plot>Dusk of the Gods is an isometric real-time role-playing game.The time of Ragnarok draws near. In the final battle between Gods and Giants, the dead will rise from Hela&apos;s realm of torture and rally under the banner of Loke, the God of Mischief, who shall turn all of Midgard into a battlefield against his brother Odin, the one-eyed, father of the Gods of Asgard. As Thor drops Mjollnir, his hammer of lightning, as Freya falls from her Golden Cart and Heimdal is pierced by the horns of Loke, the fire giant Surt shall wield his ensorcelled sword and purge the land in flames, so that eons later, a new dynasty of man can arise. Thus the sage Mimer has seen it in the Well of Wisdom. It is the dusk of the gods.Can fate be turned? Odin summons a champion, who has died on the fields of battle and is guided to Asgard by the Valkyries. This champion must find the six elements needed to forge a chain that can bind the hell hound Fenris, the Giant&apos;s best ally in the upcoming pandemonium. In addition, the champion must stop the quarrels of the Gods. Thor has lost the head of his hammer. Vidar, a son of Odin, strives to slay Hodur, who is said to have killed Baldur. Freya, the goddess of love and beauty, desires a necklace held by four dwarves. Frey is madly in love with the giantess Gerd, daughter of Surt, who demands the all-powerful Sword of Victory in exchange for the hand of Gerd. As you plunge into the whirl of intrigue, deceit and greed in the realm of the Viking gods, you travel the lands of the living and the dead, visit Aesir&apos;s underwater realm and cross the oceans in a magical pocket ship, and have a hand in all the legends from King Beowulf&apos;s fight with the dragon to the slaying of the Lady of the Hill.With a focus on storytelling and dialogue, Dusk of the Gods is an exploration of the Viking legends more than a full-fledged role-playing game - not deep, but broad. Only two basic statistics (Warrior and Sage abilities), few fights in simple &quot;Click &apos;em dead&quot;-fashion and a rather puzzling system of rune magic are balanced by a score of objects, quests and places in one huge, seamless game world (complete with a day-night cycle).</plot>

  <plot>Electronic Popple is an action/puzzle game. Play as MIN or MAX, two chips who must journey through six levels of a large computer to eventually defeat the evil Overclock King. Two players can play simultaneously. The game is similar in concept to fighting games such as Double Dragon. Players can walk, run, and jump to move around.The fighting is of the &quot;combo-move&quot; style, where the faster that a player can attack, the more hits they can achieve. The characters have a lot of attack moves: the &quot;tread attack&quot;, &quot;gathering power attack&quot;, &quot;jump attack&quot;, &quot;running attack&quot;, &quot;running jump attack&quot;, &quot;death blow attack&quot;, and &quot;catching attack&quot;.Players must fight against computer components, such as fans, resistors, capacitors, batteries, and floppy disks. Later levels include monitors, screws, and nuts. These later characters have many more hit points and some have special powers, such as the ability of screws to replicate and turn into mines, or the nuts which can roll across the screen very quickly. Some enemies have different attacking styles, which must be mastered in order to defeat them.Defeated enemies drop special items that can be useful to the player, such as heath restoring or speed punch. Sometimes enemies drop &quot;popple&quot;. Popple is the &quot;energy&quot; that has turned all of the components into enemies. However, when the character absorbs the popple, the character becomes stronger. Once a character absorbs enough popple, the character increases in hit-points and fighting power.The levels are presented in isometric 3D, and the graphics have a cartoonish look, with some very humourous animations (such as the monitors, which look upwards and whistle innocently when a player is facing them, but advance in tip-toe steps and then jump on the player from behind).Along the way, players must defeat minor bosses, such as &quot;Die HDD&quot; and &quot;Megatron&quot;, and there are in-game cut-scenes where friendly characters are introduced and whose dialogue advances the plot or provides hints.There are telephone boxes at various places through the game, which allows the player to save the state, provided that the phone card has been found first. However, upon reloading the level, all enemies will be resurrected each time, which can lead to some frantic play.</plot>

While you were away, unknown attackers destroyed your home, killed your entire family, and stole the Chalice that you need to win the throne. When you are implicated in your own family&apos;s death, you are forced into exile. With a help of an old friend who contributed an old Jenner and some credits, you must become a mercenary. You must travel the Inner Sphere in search of clues to who set you up, and eventually avenge your family and recover the Chalice. You have five years. Good luck and good hunting. Mechwarrior was the first 3D BattleTech game developed. Dynamix (who later developed the Starsiege series) created it for Activision. You go to a planet and in search of &quot;fixers&quot; who will set up some contracts with the local authorities. The terms are a flat payment and some salvage payments. Some houses are very stingy but they tell you a lot about the mission. Others pay well but may not tell you everything. You can buy/sell/repair &apos;Mechs, hire/fire pilots, decide which planet to move to, as you try to maintain decent relationships with all five houses of the Inner Sphere, while trying to uncover clues about where you need to go. This ground-breaking game is very replayable, as each mission is randomly generated. There&apos;s even some extended campaigns where you run 2-3 missions in a row. (The following is the plot from the SNES version of Mechwarrior.)You are Herras Ragen. When you were 12 (3017) your father Colonel Joseph T.

Over at a friend&apos;s you heard sounds of explosions. Rushing home you found a roaring inferno of what used to be the home you grew up with your family. Newly orphaned you vowed revenge on whoever had done this.The year is 3027. Now a young man, you cannot serve House Davion after what happened all those years ago.

The player can move horizontally and (to a limited degree) vertically, and the traditional gun is accompanied by a shield that can be activated at the press of a button. Everything costs energy, however, so there is a time constraint to play. Medals are earned during play which can be redeemed for ship enhancements (reduced energy use, increased fire power or increased shot damage) if the player is able to successfully dock with a starbase. Docking also refills the player&apos;s energy after each wave.</plot>

  <plot>Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939-1943 is the first of four Naval Combat Simulators by Strategic Simulations Inc. in the 1990&apos;s. The player commands either the British Navy or German Navy during WW II. Fight an entire campaign, mini campaigns or individual battles. The game includes a historical database of ships, display of ships damage status by deck, real time action and instant replay features. There are 3 ways to enjoy the game. The Captain&apos;s view puts you on the bridge of one of the great battleships, cruisers or destroyers of the era. Listen to the dramatic sound effects created by the roar of your guns as you fire them. Watch the shells splash in the distance or explode on target. See the flash of enemy guns and feel your ship vibrate as it is hit. Go down below with the damage control parties and attempt to plug the holes before your ship capsizes and sinks. The Fleet view shows an eagle eye perspective of the individual ships in the task force. The Grand Admiral view zooms out even further to give you a strategic map of your entire navy and all visible enemy vessels.</plot>

  <plot>Pizza Tycoon is a strategy game where you are an aspiring pizza chef, who wants to start the best pizza chain in the world. You begin by choosing a character you want to be (they differ in appearance and abilities, but the most important factor is the amount of money they have at the start). Then you choose one of the cities in the USA or Europe, where you will rent the building that will become your first pizza restaurant. Before you open it, however, you have to buy furniture, decor and floors (there&apos;s a huge choice); hire some cooks and waiters; add some pizzas to your menu, and buy ingredients (you can buy at various shops, which offer various quality of the ingredients). Once this is all ready, you can open your first restaurant and then advertise it via fliers, billboards, newspaper or TV ads. Creating your own pizzas, either to include into your menu or to take part in pizza-making competitions, is an important part of the game. You begin with an empty dough, and you&apos;re free to add a lot of various vegetables, meat, fruits or herb onto it. Remember that various people like various ingredients - if your restaurant is in a district populated mostly by kids, you can expect that a pizza made of sweet things will be popular. Also, specific ingredients rise and fall in popularity; if the newspaper announces that pineapples are bad for health, then sales of your Pineapple Pizza might plummet!But while earning money as a honest citizen can be fun, it&apos;s even more exciting to get involved with the Underworld and buy weapons to devastate your competitor&apos;s restaurant, or do missions for the Mafia (which usually involve picking up something at a specific place at a specific time, and bringing it somewhere else at a different time). But beware, as this can bring you problems, either from the law or from the Mafia itself.</plot>

  <plot>In Gold Rush!, Jerrod Wilson (the player) receives a letter from his long-lost brother (who fled the city years before when was hastily accused and convicted of a crime he didn&apos;t commit) asking him to join in Sacramento, California. If that&apos;s not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and &quot;strike gold&quot; (literally).Released late into the lifespan of Sierra&apos;s AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has it&apos;s dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink.. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.</plot>

It operates either on 10-game-minute turns, or interrupt-to-issue-orders mode.

A very advanced feature included is a scenario designer.The game can be played either hot-seated or with a computer opponent.</plot>

  <plot>The year is 1916, the dawn of the first World War. New pilots are being trained in use of the airplane, a still relatively new flying invention that may yet have some military value. Certainly the German army is using them, and therefore it&apos;s up to the British to respond. Stationed in a small airfield in the town of Thetford, England, a small group of pilots have been transfered from the allied countries to form a squadron and fight against German forcesWings of Glory is one of the relatively few World War 1 flight simulators. It is played in 1st person, with 3rd person camera options and uses Origin&apos;s RealSpace Engine. In the main campaign, players start as a fresh rookie pilot, newly transfered to England. Players can have conversations with other pilots,check the kill board for the entire squadron or commence the next mission. Missions begin with a briefing explaining the objectives and then players are put in the front seat of their aircraft. They must take off, reach the appropriate waypoints, perform the objective and return home to land. All planes have a machine gun, of varying capacities , which fires in front of the plane. Some planes are also able to carry bombs. There is no radar or other detection method on the planes, so players must be alert to oncoming enemies.In addition to the usual campaign mode it also featured a &quot;Gauntlet mode&quot; where the player faces a never-ending wave of successive waves of enemy aircraft. The goal of Gauntlet mode is simply to last as long as possible. The game also features a mission designer to create custom scenarios.</plot>

  <plot>The last in a short-lived line of low-budget flight sims from COSMI, War Eagles is a decent action-oriented sim set in World War 1. You can choose to play as either a British, or a German pilot. On the British side, you have a choice of 5 missions: patrol, escort, balloon busting, one-against-many dogfight (aptly named &quot;The Hornet&apos;s Nest&quot;), and single combat. There are also 5 missions on the German side that are basically mirror image of the British missions (e.g. balloon defense instead of balloon busting, and so on). In the balloon mission, you try to shoot down or defend a large floating Zeppelin.Hornet&apos;s Nest is likely to be very challenging for a beginner, although ace pilots may quickly take advantage of the game&apos;s nonexistent WW1 fighter flight dynamics to dispose of enemy planes.</plot>

  <plot>Abe&apos;s Oddysey is the first game set in Oddworld, a fictional universe created by Oddworld Inhabitants. The protagonist of the game is Abe, who is a Mudokon - a member of a once prosperous race, which has now been enslaved by the Glukkons, forced to work in their huge corporations. The food factories have found a new type of meat - delicious to all the inhabitants, and no-one knows the recipe. Following his stomach, Abe eavesdrops on the corporate leaders&apos; conversation, and makes the most frightening and disgusting discovery: his own race is that secret delicious food. Alas, Abe is discovered, and the guards are marching towards him. He must escape, but he can&apos;t leave his friends to mercy of those eaters. He must rescue as many as he can, and tell the world the truth that lies beyond.Essentially Abe&apos;s Oddysee is a platform game, though with a darker atmosphere than most titles in the genre. The game has several unique gameplay features. Abe is almost completely helpless, cannot wield weapons, and can be easily killed by his brutal enemies. That&apos;s why most of the game involves moving with careful timing, sneaking, and outsmarting your foes, even though there are also many parts where Abe runs and jumps, as in most platformers. Abe&apos;s only power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while, and also to open &quot;bird portals&quot;. Opening those portals is the final action needed to bring a fellow Mudokon to safety. Before that, Abe needs to locate his enslaved friends and lead them out of the hostile environment by using what the game calls &quot;Gamespeak&quot;. Gamespeak is a way of verbal communication through simple one-button commands, which are assigned to various expressions, such as &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Follow me&quot;, &quot;Wait here&quot;, etc.The game has pre-rendered background graphics, and uses pre-rendered CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.</plot>

Earth is a wasteland, and the evil Lord Dread rules with an iron hand. Only a small group of high-tech soldiers under the command of the charismatic Captain Power battles the nemesis and his band of Bio Dread henchmen.None of this matters in the game though. Instead, you launch into two space shooter sequences. Part one, the training mission, has you destroy three Dread drones in a cockpit-view shooting range. Part 2, the Attack on Volcania, is a 2D sidescroller in which you eliminate approaching enemy spaceships. If enough hostiles have died, you get to bomb the enemy lair. The ship-shooting / hideout-bombing sequences are repeated until the fortresses shields are finally down.You will find more information about the Captain Power TV series in the trivia and links sections.</plot>

  <plot>Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You&apos;ve got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you&apos;ve got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you&apos;ll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</plot>

  <plot>PC-Bakterien! is set in the microcosm. A vicious attack of mean bacteria and viruses endangers the organism. You take the role of Mikky, the worm-like chief defense microbe, and have to defend the organism against the microscopic meanies. Mikky won&apos;t be able to do this task alone, but he gets the help of allied cells, namely the hurrying helper cells and the hungry but sluggish feeder cells. Together, Mikky and his allies have to eliminate the multiplying foes to save the organism.PC-Bakterien! is an isometric puzzle game against time. In every level, the basic objective is to clear the organism of all bacteria and viruses. As the enemies constantly multiply when they have the space to do so, this goal has to be achieved before there are too many foes around. Mikky is the only character you directly control. You have to instruct the helper cells to mark the enemies by moving Mikky to your allies, then the feeder cells are able to eat the critters. However, your friends are not the smartest and you have to help them finding their targets. When the enemies are not close to them, the allied cells just aimlessly move around. Mikky himself can act as an obstacle to help the cells finding the way, but is more effective to make use of the items the chief microbe can pick up. Place barriers and arrows to guide the cells to the bacteria and viruses, certain less common items such as a whistle might also help you.The first enemies are immobile and do nothing but multiplying, but later you also encounter moving bacteria, enemies that can only be defeated under certain conditions, and even predators that destroy the helper cells. You might also not find any helper cells in a level and have to create them yourself first. Various puzzle elements are introduced throughout the game, such as enzymes to open new ways by creating tissue, nerves that trigger certain pulses, multiple layers, or alcohol bacteria you have to lure away with beer...You are able to choose between three difficulty levels, with the easiest one being a training level without multiplying enemies. For every level, your high score will be saved. You are awarded points for various things, such as instructing helper cells, collecting certain items, or when foes are eliminated. You also get bonus points at the end of a level depending on how fast you were and on the difficulty level.</plot>

  <plot>Aliens of Gold, the first game in the Blake Stone series, pits the space-age British secret agent against Dr. Pyrus Goldfire; a madman bent on world domination. Using a mastery of genetic engineering and a tremendous reserve of wealth, Dr. Goldfire intends to unleash a mutant army upon the Earth.The first chapter begins in Goldfire&apos;s S.T.A.R. Institute headquarters building. Each level has Blake fighting through guards to find an elevator keycard for the next level. Dr. Goldfire will personally appear along the way to fire shots at Blake, and his genetic creations also pose a tough challenge. Each chapter lasts 10 levels, and brings Blake closer to reaching Goldfire, only to have the mad doctor escape to a new installation in his network, and the start of a new chapter.Blake Stone uses the Wolfenstein 3-D engine to render its levels. Basic gameplay and enemy AI is similar in most respects. Some of Blake&apos;s innovations include silent weapons that can kill guards without alerting others. Alerts are given to the player through text messages on the HUD. Health can be gained through use of wall-mounted vending machines, operated with tokens picked up off dead guards. An automap and stat-tracking are both available during gameplay. Finally, there are friendly AI characters who offer clues and powerups when you speak to them - provided Blake doesn&apos;t accidentally shoot them first!</plot>

  <plot>An alien vessel had approached earth along an elliptical orbit, at first mistaken for a comet, and launched pods at the surface. These pods disembarked giant alien robots which then carved out a path of destruction, attacking cities and removing life. In desperation, the world unleashed it&apos;s nuclear arsenal to stop the robots, in the process adding to the devastation. The broken remains of humanity gathered the pieces of the destroyed robot invaders and learned enough of it&apos;s manufacturing and design to copy the designs and build their own. Manufacturing their own armies, they prepare to repel an anticipated invasion that will come with the alien vessel&apos;s second pass...Ultrabots is a single player first person robot simulation game. The player sits in the cockpit of one of the robotic fighter and is able to attack with weapons specific to that model. The player can instantly switch his location between any robot currently in play via a strategy map. There are three different models of these robotic assault machines. The Humanoid model is the main fighting model and average speed, The Scorpion model is slow, has a powerful stinger tail weapon and can lay down or dismantle the power grid. The Scout model is the fastest type but has light weaponry. These robots only operate within a certain proximity of the &quot;power grid&quot; and function only on a limited amount of battery power when leaving it&apos;s proximity. The power grid can only be extended through use of the Scorpion robot which should be protected due to it&apos;s slow speed and vulnerability. Each damaged robot can be repaired at the player&apos;s base after a short delay. Success on each map comes when one side is able to reach the enemy&apos;s base and destroy it, halting any further production.</plot>

While you can adjust the difficulty of the task, the object in all cases is the same: to search the complex, find and release as many of the prisoners as possible (by activating the transporter beam, which will teleport them back up to the ship), and get out alive-in an hour or less.If the Tollah base can be likened to an iceberg, you begin the game at the tip: inside the top room, the only one that connects the complex with the surface of the asteroid. (Since there is no air and no escape on the asteroid itself, the door to the outside, being &quot;off limits,&quot; is not shown on the display.) From this vestibule there are only two usable exits. The larger obviously leads to a gravshaft; the smaller looks like an ordinary doorway-but there are no other rooms on the floor. Whichever way you choose to begin your quest, there will be no turning back once you walk through the door.</plot>

  <plot>For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in King&apos;s Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land&apos;s four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King&apos;s Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like its predecessor, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface. The CD-ROM version of the game includes both DOS and Windows versions, full speech, a 50-meg introduction, and the Girl in the Tower theme song.</plot>

  <plot>Before the days of the real-time strategy game such as the WarCraft series, there was Medieval Warriors, which is a turn-based fantasy strategy game that looks like an early prototype of the RTS genre.In Medieval Warriors, you control either the Blue team or the Red team, each with twelve warriors. There are four maps, or battlefield terrains, where the battles take place, and each of them presents different obstacles and challenges. For instance, in &quot;Frontier Outpost,&quot; teams are placed in separate forts divided by a forest and a pond; in &quot;Castle Keep,&quot; however, it is just a maze of rooms and hallways.Each of the twelve warriors are distinct with their own stats, such as move range and hit points, and they can also equip different weapons, such as a bow or a sword. They even have their own names. Strategic decisions such as the formation of your party as well as their position on the terrain must be made to take advantage of their strengths and protect their weaknesses. You must also be able to determine which weapon to use, and since weapons are expendable, you have to be careful not to waste anything. While you can choose to play against a computer opponent, you can also play against a human player over a modem.</plot>

This can be played either as a continuous battle, or with short breaks to catch your composure.The role-playing elements eschew the Ultima-style plan view in favor of a pseudo-3D system. Deism and Shamanism are just some of the included magic disciplines. Magical vehicles help you get around the 100 landscapes more quickly, although you spend much time on foot.

Through a series of missions, you&apos;ll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped &quot;rail-shooter&quot;, where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to &quot;pick them up&quot;. Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You&apos;ll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it&apos;s not beneficial. Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</plot>

Initially you can only manage the lower teams, but if you succeed over a few seasons you will become respected enough to have a chance to get the top roles.The focus is on ultra-realism, which makes it very hard to quickly transform a club&apos;s fortunes, as there is a lack of money at many of the smaller teams and attracting players is harder than in the Premier Manager series and similar.

The greater the difficulty level (Easy, Medium or Hard), the more pixels are missing. The player must figure out what the phrase says and type it in. Answering correctly leads to more information relating to the phrase (the person who said a famous quote or the answer to a riddle) and a congratulatory line of synthesized speech.

  <plot>Acid Tetris is a freeware Tetris clone, true to the original version. There is only one game mode, where you guide an unlimited amount of falling bricks to form complete rows until you hit the top of the screen. After reaching a certain amount of points, the speed of the bricks is increased. This difficulty level can also be set from the start in the main game menu. There are a few features that make this game stand out. The bricks are colorful and upon removing a line, a yellow smiley appears with a different expression and sound depending on the amount of rows you removed with a single brick. On the right is an overview of the amount of different bricks used. There is a high score table and the game features both up-tempo and relaxing music, including a remake of the classic Tetris song.</plot>

  <plot>Play Keef the Thief, a promising young thief who finds himself on the outskirts of the Mercon the Merchant City. Considering the penalty of thievery is the removal of certain body parts, our young hero must be careful in his profession and ultimately (among others) train himself to access and steal from the city treasury.Keef the Thief: A Boy and His Lockpick is a first-person perspective role-playing game while in adventure mode (turn-based). In combat, it changes into a real-time first-person perspective setting. The game itself was set to be a parody type game, clearly identifiable from various descriptions in the game and enemy names during combat. The aim of the game among others is to steal everything in site. At least in the city. The game map itself besides the city included various dungeons, jungles and, an arena among others.The game introduces four vital elements of game play: Thievery, Adventuring, Combat, and Alchemy:1. ThieveryThe thievery element is based on the ability to disarm traps before the player can loot treasure. There are many houses or other places where the player can steal valuable objects (at least within the city walls). The higher the skills, the more options the player has to rightly pick which course the player wants to choose to disarm a trap.AdventuringWhen the player has stolen everything valuable from underwear to gold crowns from the city, eventually the player will have to venture outside the city into the unknown depths of the surrounding jungle. There are a lot of places that has yet to be discovered in the game. Just be sure to be well equipped with armor and weapons. Monsters have a bad habit of popping up, almost always!CombatThe first-person real-time combat setting comes complete with a top-down radar indicating the player&apos;s positioning and the enemies. In the combat screen the player can melee to victory or just shoot them from a distance. That is if the player has the appropriate weapons available.AlchemyFor the most part it&apos;s alchemy, though magic spells are also created through this process. Collecting ingredients is one thing, experimenting on what works is another. Sometimes the player may get lucky and find a recipe. Sometimes.</plot>

Some levels offer transformative powers. These include being turned into a hippopotamus - which allows you to step on ghosts - and a vacuum cleaner - to clean up pellets corrupted by a wandering enemy. On some levels, you can also briefly turn the protagonist into a spaceship or a tank, where you can shoot ghosts from a fixed vantage point.As with most arcade titles at the time, there is no true ending; the game loops back to the first level when you finish the last one.</plot>

In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.</plot>

You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy&apos;s niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape. Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models. To escape the mansion, you&apos;ll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</plot>

Giger as a source of background artwork and inspiration.You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills.

That&apos;s when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.</plot>

Its more linear than Arena and Daggerfall, and more like Ultima Underworld.The Battlespire is a training ground to become an Imperial Battlemage. When you enter, the place has been taken over by a Daedra Prince and you must save The Battlespire.Battlespire plays more like a shooter than an RPG; there are no towns, no gold, and you get all your items by finding them (either on the ground or on dead bodies). Your weapons consist of the basic medieval RPG implements. There are people to talk to in The Battlespire. Battlespire only provides around 60 hours of gameplay compared to more than 100 hours in Daggerfall. This game also supports multiplayer, allowing you to battle it out with your friends and other Guilds.</plot>

  <plot>Anacreon: Reconstruction 4021 is an early ASCII space strategy game in where you play (obviously) as the supreme leader of a galactic empire struggling for global dominance. It contains the common elements of 4X strategy, including planet management and development, exploration, tech research and war.The game contains several scenarios (although you can design your own with a text editor) that present the general background of the game (number of players, number of turns and difficulty). Each map is randomly generated, and wins the player with the highest score when reaching the turn maximum.Colonies cannot be created. Instead, there are independent planets that must be conquered in order to adding them to your empire. Colony management is almost automatic, as there are no facilities (apart of certain orbital platforms) to build and resources are used and divided by the computer. The different types of ships and troops, also, are automatically built in planets equipped with the necessary tech. Tech is discovered linearly as you progress, but each planet has a tech level (that also advances automatically when in an empire) that determines what can be constructed there. You can, however, establish the general purpose of a colony (agricultural, military outpost, raw material mineà) and transport freely resources and troops between colonies, and you must pay attention to several statistics (efficiency, warehouses, type of planetà).As there is no diplomacy (except a message system for multiplayer), Anacreon plays mainly as a game about war and conquest.</plot>

The player sits at the controls of the Space Fortress and can alternate between management of targeting (weapons), power allocation, damage control, powerup retrieval and powerup usage. At all times, the radar image will be represented on the screen showing any approching enemy ships. By taking control of the weapons, the player can blast the enemies using several different types of weapons. Each consumes energy, and enemy hits deplete the space fortress&apos; shield. Defeated enemies leave power-ups which must be retrieved with probes and brought back to the space fortress for use.

  <plot>Spellcasting 101 is the first in a series of risque adventures from the mind of Steve Meretzky of Leather Goddesses of Phobos fame.This textual liaison pits you as Ernie Eaglebeak, a student at Sorcerer University who finds himself caught in a possible Doomsday situation. Seduce the women and have fun along the way. There are many women with little clothing, although no actual nudity. The game is loaded with college type jokes (eg: Join the famous Tappa Kegga Bru or I Phelta Thi).The game play was a development of the parser based text adventure typical of the Infocom games but included graphic images that changed as the puzzles were solved and the game progressed.</plot>

  <plot>This game is a close relative of the better-known Kroz series. Searching for the Heart of Courage in the Ezam dungeons, the player must evade the lost souls of previous adventurers while strategically using the pick axes and teleport scrolls strewn about the place. The game&apos;s primary twist is that it takes place in a maze that is largely invisible. After a tantalizing glimpse of the whole area at the start of play, most of the maze disappears, with wall segments only reappearing when the player bumps into them. Pick axes can be used to cut through wall segments and teleport scrolls take the player to a random spot in the maze. While all this is going on, the lost souls relentlessly home in on the player, adding urgency to the proceedings.</plot>

Cyberia 2 is essentially the same, except the 3D rendered graphics have been improved, and the quantity of in-game movies has been increased. Cyberia 2 takes off where the original ends. After destroying FWA leader Devlin and his oribital headquarters, Zak and the Cyberia weapon crash land back to Earth, where they are picked up by an FWA team led by the maniacal Dr. Corbin. Corbin sticks Zak in cryo-storage and uses the remains of the Cyberia weapon to create a doomsday virus known as nano-toxin. His FWA employers want the nano-toxin to put down a growing rebel movement, but Corbin (who&apos;s got something of a messiah-complex) intends to use it to kill millions and &quot;reshape the world as we know it&quot;.Three years later Zak is thawed out by a renegade FWA Major, and together the two of them have to find Corbin and stop his Sinister Plan(tm).</plot>

  <plot>This platform game features the small blue-haired cutesy creatures that were popular around the time (although surely not with most computer game buyers?). You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap. Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.</plot>

Ultimately fighting you way to the title &quot;Champion&quot;.GAMEPLAYTV Sports Boxing introduces many elements within the game, which among others may be categorized as the following:1. Character CreationThe &quot;campaign&quot; version in TV Sports: Boxing allows you to start &quot;a new career&quot; of which you have to create a new &quot;human player&quot;. Here you can customize your boxer, generally how he looks but more importantly what stats he begins, what style of boxing (ie. Boxer, Brawler, Dancer, Defensive) and which punch packs the most (ie. Jab, Cross, Uppercut). Managing Bouts and TrainingAt the &quot;Training Camp&quot; you can meet up with your manager and your trainer. The Manager sets up bouts for you to fight in the following month. Managers can only introduce bouts relevant to their &quot;quality&quot; of service. Better managers may be hired as they provide better paying bouts - and higher ranking opponents (though they also ask a higher wage). You must however, fire your current manager first and have adequate funds to hire a new one.Each bout pays a certain amount of money. Regardless if you win or lose (minus manager cuts, trainer fees and training camp expenses).The Trainer provides you with additional training per month, depending on his/her specialty stat (ie. Power, Stamina, Footwork, etc.) If you continue a successful career, better trainers will appear offering different types of services (which they also ask a higher fee, of course).While meeting with the Trainer, you can also purchase equipment to increase your training (stats increase). There are 3 slots available for equipment. Equipment have a certain duration of time (months) expiration before it needs to be replaced.Additionally, you can also view your character here, to view monthly stats increase, either obtained by training or by bouts (stats increase are automatic).Round 1 - Fight!After you&apos;ve arranged a bout with your manager, you can enter the appointed bout in the following month. The TV commentator gives comments on &quot;Tale-of-the-Tape&quot; of both boxers before the match begins, as well as the rules of the game.The RingThe match starts in a top-down perspective - here you can close in to your opponent and fight face-to-face or you can dance around the ring (usually meant to increase your stamina).BoxingThe fight itself enters a 3rd person perspective screen (Player 1 on the left, Computer opponent or Player 2 on the right).The purpose is of course to weaken your opponent and knock him down! If the stamina bar reaches zero, the opponent falls down. However, if the Head or Body reaches zero, they fall down and don&apos;t stand up! Knock Out!Being knocked out 3 times in the same round or serious injuries is considered a T.K.O.</plot>

  <plot>Troika is a collection of three arcade style games: Rebel Planets, Ivan, and Metal Hearts, from Russian programmer Dima Pavlovsky.Rebel Planets is an arcade shooter where you control a small ship at the bottom of the screen and shoot a cylindrical projectile upwards. The goal is to destroy enemies on the screen with the projectile while making sure the projectile does not come into contact with various obstacles scattered around the screen. This plays like a cross between Space Invaders and Breakout.Ivan is a puzzle game in which the objective is to collect all the money on the game screen by wending your way through a maze in which you have to move blocks out of the way to open up passages, you have move these blocks in the correct order or else you trap yourself or seal yourself off from parts of the maze. This is very similar to the popular Japanese puzzle game Sokoban.In Metal Hearts you play the role of a plumber whose job it is to connect two water mains together using a changing series of elbow joints and straight sections. You are in a race against the clock as the water begins to flow down the pipe you are building from the input to the output. This is a clone of the game Pipe Dream.</plot>

But when he discovered the evil Zilla&apos;s plan to summon monsters from other dimensions and conquer the world, he left in disgust. Realizing that Lo Wang might jeopardize his plans, Zilla sends his assassins after Wang...Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter, set in a generic &quot;Asialand&quot; which looks like China and Japan conflated together. It features a lot of immature and politically incorrect humor. Occasionally, you&apos;ll even come across scantily clad anime girls. As Lo Wang you have to complete several levels, fighting enemies and solving (sometimes quite hard) puzzles on the way. Your enemies include evil ninjas with various weapons, &quot;coolies&quot; which carry a crate of dynamite and blow themselves up when near you, female assassins with crossbows and many more. To combat them, you can find a variety of weapons and equipment. Weapons include: your fists, a katana, shuriken (that&apos;s a plural!), a riot gun, an Uzi (or two), a rocket launcher (for which you can find heat-seeking missiles or a nuclear missile), a grenade launcher, sticky bombs, a railgun, and even some enemies&apos; body parts. You can also find equipment such as caltrops to leave in the enemies&apos; way or gas bombs to choke foes who happen to be near it.</plot>

The meteors fall from the top of the screen and you must dodge them by moving your character around with the keyboard. You can move anywhere on the screen you wish.Your only defense against falling meteors are the bunkers. But everytime you walk through a bunker you will clear a path through it, weakening your defenses. If you last long enough a new bunker may replace a weakened one but with the drawback that it will crush you when it arrives. The meteors will leave behind them a line of radiation and you must avoid these as well since they will subtract from points you&apos;ve earned. The longer you last the higher the points you&apos;ll get.</plot>

  <plot>In Strike Base the earth is once again threatened by alien forces. The player controls Admiral Leighton who has to coordinate and lead the defense battles on four moons with different geographical features (lava, mountains, forest and underground). Every mission begins with the tactical map where the actual combat situation is shown. Then the player has to equip the vehicles with the appropriate weapons, defenses and other tactical items like satellites or teleports. In every mission the player has a predefined set of the four vehicle types at his disposal (two tanks, a bomber and a battle glider). After these tactical preparations begins the action part of Strike Base: The player controls the vehicles in 1st or 3rd person view and shoots at the alien troops, e.g. rocket launchers, tanks or mines. Of course the player can only use one unit at a time, so he can set waypoints for the others. The vehicles are almost completely mouse controlled, the keyboard used solely to control the speed. Destroyed enemies leave refreshments for the player&apos;s equipment, it can also be stocked up at the base.The 15 missions have varied goals, e.g. destroying all enemies, finding escape capsules or destroying specific hostile units. A mission is lost when all units are destroyed or the enemy conquers the player&apos;s base. There are four difficulty settings which affect the number and strength of the enemies but only on the two higher settings can all missions be played.</plot>

  <plot>Mylo Steamwitz, an enterprising space trader, has set out to the perilous mines of the Altairian system. He hopes to collect enough crystals to start a profitable twibble farm. Crystal Caves is a side-scrolling platform game, where the objective is to finish all 16 levels, collecting every single crystal within. On his way, Mylo is threatened by numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it&apos;s easy to get Mylo stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be restarted. Apart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot - collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but it&apos;s not always easy to get them! It&apos;s also possible to find a power-up that reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as they are always instrumental to victory!</plot>

  <plot>This educational strategy game represents the events of Norman Conquest of England taking place in XI century. Historically, Harold the Second, last Anglo-Saxon king of England, lost the Battle of Hastings to William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, who became the next king.The game is flown on schematic map of England. Players take the roles of William and Harold. In turns they give orders, move units and conquer areas. To win the game, player must gain 60 points. Points are gained by controlling land and taxing peasants. Potency is important in taxing peasants and fighting: it is increased on &quot;low&quot; tax rates and decreased on &quot;medium&quot;/&quot;hard&quot; tax rates. Player will gain 1 point per 1 peasant at &quot;medium&quot; tax rate and 2 points at &quot;hard&quot; tax rate. To set the tax rate player should have tax collectors.If one of player&apos;s units enters an area occupied by enemy, the fight will be proposed. Area becomes controlled by player if it was not occupied by anyone, or fight was won. Spies may be used. They hide from the enemies and are not seen around 80% of the time no matter who occupies the land.Killing the opposing monarch will not necessarily win the game. Harold is already the king, so William can crown himself as soon as he gains 30 points or kills Harold. He must go to London to accept the crown.The educational twist of the game is in-game encyclopedia and a question before player&apos;s turn. Incorrect answer will result in a loss of player&apos;s movement ability.The Quiz full of questions on these historical events may be played instead of strategy simulation, where multiple options may be turned on/off as well.</plot>

  <plot>A polygonal 3D fighter, Time Warriors puts eight fighters from eight different times and places against each other: Yrwen the Celt, armed with a long sword, Hysis the Egyptian, wielding two sabers, Molloch the Barbarian with his battle axe, the scimitar-wielding Sultan Iz-Baal, Shodan the Samurai and his katana, from a Chinese monastery Dong brings just a staff, Olof the Viking plans flattening his opponents with a war hammer and Apokles the Spartan brings a double-edged sword.Gameplay is similar to other games in the same genre - two buttons control the weapon and two other ones kicking, because both come with a &quot;fast&quot; and a &quot;strong&quot; variant. Combos are done with fast key presses or sequential moves, and by taking damage, the fighter gathers magic points that can be used to perform a destructive special attack. Like Virtua Fighter, if a fighter falls from the battle arena, he or she loses from ring out. The usual options such as combat length, number of bouts, difficulty level and auto-block are included.Graphically, the game can be tweaked to run on several configurations, by disabling more advanced graphic options such as scenario objects, light and real-time shadow calculation and textures.</plot>

  <plot>The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player&apos;s perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.</plot>

  <plot>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level arenÆt always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything youÆd logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy ûthis reduces the significance of the points system.</plot>

The players vary in speed, and in which skills (such as heading, overhead kicks, close control and shooting) they are competent in. Running with the ball generally works better than passing. Plenty of tournaments are offered, as is the chance to edit team data and kits. One advantage it has over the original Sensible Soccer is onscreen referees and linesmen.</plot>

  <plot>Shut the Box is a version of a classic dice game. Players roll a pair of dice. They then select digits from 1 to 9 that total the same number as the dice. Once a digit is selected, it cannot be used on subsequent rolls in the current round. When the player cannot select digits totaling the dice roll, the round is over. The player scores points equal to the sum of the digits used that round. If the player successfully uses all nine digits, they get five bonus points for a total of 50 points for the round. The game consists of five rounds and, naturally, the player with the highest score wins.The game was designed for PC/XT/AT computers with any kind of monitor. The graphics are made up of &quot;ANSI characters,&quot; which allow for a more colorful display than CGA would have. Simple sound is provided by the PC speaker.</plot>

He no longer needs to feed his clan, so there is no required minimum food target, unlike the original game. Other bonus items are located around the levels, while yet more can be found by using your club creatively and adventurously. There are bosses and passwords after every few levels.

The alliance of races in Galanor isn&apos;t very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it&apos;s your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game&apos;s title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.The game contains a time limit; you&apos;ve got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.</plot>

Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he&apos;s out for revenge.At the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.As Werdna, you&apos;ll slowly regain your magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany you on your journey. Your goal is to get to the surface and get your amulet (and hopefully a little revenge). But in your way are a variety of monsters, guardians, and gung-ho adventurers out for your head. Not to mention being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of your old enemy Trebor. Make it to the surface, and you&apos;ll have to face one final grudge match against the heroes who defeated you in the past before you can get your amulet.Wizardry IV features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics that was used in the previous 3 Wizardry (and used one final time in Wizardry V). Unlike every other game in the entire series, you cannot import characters from the previous game (for obvious reasons). The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series. Wizardry IV is generally considered to be the most difficult game in the entire series, and experience with the other games in the series is recommended.</plot>

  <plot>Somewhere between Jetfighter 3 and 4 came Full Burn, a game that takes a turn towards arcade action over simulation and adds a Wing Commander-like interactive movie air to the game.As the game starts a conflict between the U.S., er sorry NATO and Russia erupts over some Norwegian oil fields. This sets the stage for the main storyline of the game which can be viewed from either the NATO or Russian side. The campaign is made of linear pre-made missions interspersed with FMV sequences between missions. As in the Wing Commander games, scenes occur in different locations, you move to the corresponding room and click on hotspots that trigger the sequences. The airplanes in the game have simple, yet functional flight models and include the F/A-18 and F-22N on the NATO side as well as the fictional MiG-42 on the Russian side. The game engine used is identical to the Jetfighter 3 one, and the game supports multiplayer support of up to 16 players.</plot>

  <plot>Little time has passed since the events of Police Quest, when Sonny climbed the ranks of the Lytton police department and became the key element in the arrest of Jesse Baines, the notorious Drug Lord. After the trial, Sonny&apos;s application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good... until Baines escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Baines and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Baines, but things are about to get awfully personal...Using Sierra&apos;s new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the gameworld. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location.The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Baines into the happenings of the game.</plot>

May fortune favor the foolish.Kirk out.Like many movie-based games of its period, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier consists of various arcade games combined together to form a sort of action/adventure game.

You go in to raid it of its treasures and, provided it exists, of the Holy Grail. When you enter, the entrance caves in behind you and you are stuck inside. Ah well, nothing to do but continue on to find what you came for...The game utilizes a true 3D engine to display your surroundings, as in Quake. It&apos;s heavy on puzzles and light on combat. As you move further on into the ruins you&apos;ll encounter ghosts of the inhabitants and hints as to what happened to cause the ruins that surround you now.</plot>

It&apos;s up to you to prove the police wrong.A difference to the classical adventure exists: you need money to travel, get information or training. To get money, you can trade at the stock market.

  <plot>Sid Meier&apos;s Colonization is a strategy game which puts you in the role of Viceroy of the New World. You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competitionfrom other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.The game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the AmericanRevolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As yourcolonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.Each of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren&apos;t a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony. Some colonists are specialists, and thus are more effective at a certain job. The cargo you collect and produce is an important thing. You can take it to Europe to sell, and earn money to buy some other necessary things, hire colonists (though new, willing colonists appear in Europe by themselves) or buy ships and artillery. You can also trade it with the Indians or colonies of other nations. You&apos;ll construct various buildings in your colonies. They have a lot of different functions: some of them can improve the speed with which you produce valuable cargo, others allow you to defend yourself from attacks more easily or construct ships and artillery. Some buildings require you to spend a number of valuable Tools when constructed, though you can make new Tools out of ore. As you explore the land, you&apos;ll come across the Indian villages and some &quot;places of interest&quot; which can be investigated. A colonist that enters an Indian village can be welcomed with open hands, and the natives will reveal a map of nearby lands, or teach him a profession. Investigating places of interest has various consequences: sometimes you&apos;ll find nothing, sometimes you&apos;ll be killed for trespassing on ancient burial ground, but sometimes you&apos;ll find treasure! (Taking this treasure to Europe can be difficult though - if you don&apos;t have a sufficiently big ship, the King will agree to transport it for you... if you give him 50% of the gold). To defend yourself from enemies, you&apos;ll want to have some military units. Just give a colonist a musket and he&apos;ll turn into a Soldier, give him a horse, and he&apos;s a Scout or a Dragoon. However, such a warrior is typically inexperienced, though he might gain military experience in battle. Artillery is also good at defense, but don&apos;t try to leave your colonies with it - in the open field, it is useless. As you progress in the game, you&apos;ll feel that working for the King is getting more and more annoying, especially since he keeps raising your taxes, thus decreasing your income from sold goods. Your colonies produce &quot;Liberty Bells&quot;, which increase rebel sentiment in the colonies. If the majority of colonists supports your yearning for freedom, you can declare independence. But when you do that, you&apos;ll have to deal with the King&apos;s expeditionary force arriving to teach you a lesson. If you manage to defeat all his incoming armies and emerge victorious from the American Revolutionary War, you&apos;ve won!</plot>

  <plot>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final &apos;Mother of All Battles&apos; has its own surprises. Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.Later on higher levels, you&apos;ll also build mines and factories, as you&apos;ll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you&apos;re on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you&apos;ll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don&apos;t be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you&apos;ll need to invent everything for that one again.</plot>

  <plot>Hypothesizing what sorts of adventures might be got up to in Bomberman&apos;s pants, this game provides some similar gameplay in a cartoony &quot;adult&quot; style -- mobile phalluses hobble around on their stubbly little testicles, collecting sex-themed bonuses (condoms for protection against STDs, jockey shorts to boost speed) and avoiding environmental hazards (viruses, AIDS, and the dreaded snapping-teeth-of-inexpertly-performed-fellation).The player&apos;s &quot;shot&quot; can be used to temporarily neutralise enemies, open gaps in walls (revealing in the background a picture of a naked lady), or stun competitors in the multiplayer (up to 4 players) game. Once enough bonuses have been collected, doff a condom and hop into the sack with the blonde in the middle of the screen. Level layouts vary, but basic gameplay (and even the cheesecake in the background) remains much the same through 50 levels.The multiplayer game features an additional surreal mini-game, where the alpha phalli prowl the screen&apos;s periphery around a model who seems to love nothing more than to have select garments of her clothing pawed by stretching penises with grasping hands inexplicably appearing at their ends -- you&apos;ve never seen anything quite like it.</plot>

  <plot>Set in the American West of the 1880s, Freddy Pharkas was one of the fastest guns in the west. However in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny he was outgunned and Freddy had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Corsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town&apos;s doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town&apos;s problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers.Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click side-scrolling adventure game from Al Lowe. As such it has many similarities to other Sierra adventure games including Leisure Suit Larry (Al Lowe&apos;s previous work) and King&apos;s Quest. Players use the action bar at the top of the screen to choose an action type that is used on locations and objects visible to the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects, attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items that have been picked up. Like other sierra games, successful actions add to the player&apos;s score, judging the player on 1000 points.</plot>

  <plot>The Grandpa of Zeet and Deedle is a great explorer, but he hasn&apos;t returned to the Moon from his latest destination: the Earth! His grand-children take it upon themselves to follow his trail and rescue him from whatever terrestrial menace has detained him, after interacting with an extensive array of whimsical, surreal characters.SpaceKids is a good look at what interactive movies looked like just before the CD-ROM format became the new standard for extensive multimedia-rich content storage -- instead of meg-heavy digitized actors we get byte-thrifty pre-rendered sprites in front of 3D backdrops, twirling around the screen and stretching or skewing in realtime with every possible bump or jostle. To please the kids, pretty much everything in this game that isn&apos;t made of candy has got a human face with big, pleading eyes on it somewhere.Gameplay loosely follows the model set by Dragon&apos;s Lair: non-interactive animated segments (sometimes prolonged ones) are punctuated by episodes of player input, consisting of moving the actor of the moment -- sometimes our protagonists, sometimes their opponent -- in the right direction at the right moment to pass some timed obstacle or choose a fork in the plot. Unlike Dragon&apos;s Lair, death does not lurk around every corner; failing to successfully traverse the obstacle (or, uh, interact vaguely with the new strange situation in the arbitrarily appropriate fashion) generally yields only another opportunity to do so.</plot>

  <plot>Nahlakh is a shareware game written as RPG adventure with an emphasis on intricate tactical combat, and extensive world exploration. Control a team of 8 characters in a quest to find and destroy the demons of Omalin. The game manual boasts over 200 hours solving time, 100 spells, 300 different monsters, and a system for generating potentially millions of items by combining them with various enchantments and materials.In the author&apos;s own words: &quot;It&apos;s like a war game with a plot and character development. There are no &quot;experience points&quot; in Nahlakh... skills are learned by doing, not mystically improving out of thin air.The game begins with a fairly involved process of setting up your party of 8 characters. For each character 50 points are given to distribute among the main attributes of strength, intelligence, dexterity, and health. Additionally, picking an icon that represents the character, this selection will affect the skills chosen; essentially the icons are character classes. Next a number of skills are randomly selected with varying levels of accomplishment described humorously with adjectives such as &quot;lousy&quot;, &quot;feeble&quot;, &quot;wretched&quot;. With your party created the game begins, and the party is transported to the world map where a group of enemies waits close by; to the north lies a town called Nedly. The world map will remind one of the early Ultima series with the player character represented by an non-animated icon.The battle system is similar to that found within Pool of Radiance (1989); it is turn-based, each character has a limited number of steps that it takes, and then an adjacent enemy icon is targeted for attack.The game is well documented, and pressing F1 at anytime will bring up context-sensitive help. Since the game is heavily driven by keyboard commands this is an important feature.</plot>

  <plot>A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire&apos;s currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It&apos;s time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it&apos;s up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.</plot>

The pure-blooded humans have retreated in large cities while mutants live in small villages on the plains where they make a living by hunting the many monsters. Now one of the human leaders, Lord Dominix, wants to start a war to wipe out all the &quot;bad-blooded&quot; mutants. Your village chief has assigned you with the task of preventing this war.Bad Blood is a top-down action-adventure. You can not create your own character but have to pick one of the three predefined ones: Varrigg (a strong green mutant who fights with his bare hands), Dekker (a human male armed with a knife) or Jakka (she looks human but can shoot laser beams from her eyes like Cyclops of X-Men fame). The choice you make has only a limited impact on gameplay and storyline.Gameplay consists of exploring the world map, visiting several cities and villages, talking with NPCs, picking up items and new weapons (like shotguns, grenades, Uzis etc.) and lots of real-time combat. Bad Blood lacks character stats and character development. The game has a day-night cycle which influences the amount of monsters on the plains and whether or not you can talk with some NPCs.</plot>

Each level has its own time limit, ranging from seconds to minutes - this doesn&apos;t start until you make your first move, and you can look around the level at your leisure before making a stab at it. Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.</plot>

  <plot>The Hidden Below (&quot;THB&quot;) involves finding a large army of evil aliens under a factory, and sending them back to where they came from. The custom built engine used for the game, the &quot;VR-6&quot; engine, can be described as a hybrid of the &quot;Wolf3D&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; engines, in some ways more advanced than the later but in some ways being more akin to the former.Features in THB include VGA graphics, several resolutions with the ability to set height and width separately (80/160/320x240/400), stairs, diagonally angled walls, slopes, teleporters, switches, damaging terrain, controllable security cameras, crouching, light levels, flickering lights, rendered cut scenes, targeting assistÆs, auto map providing pickups, ambient sounds and the ability to look up and down. The game also keeps a score and displays the best on a high score table.In terms of content, THB has 20 large levels with radically changing texture themes, 40 different opponents with individual AI (though this includes a number of re-coloured opponents) and 14 different weapon systems.The run and gun in THB is considerably slower paced than the above mentioned games, relying more on each individual bad guy being of high toughness and limited amounts of health pickups, rather than large numbers of foes.The visuals of THB are a little disjointed having been done in several different styles from gritty to cell shaded, digitized to hand drawn etc.The sound is stated as being 16bit, though the game actually has three different quality settings for sound effects.</plot>

  <plot>Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation.Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of &quot;No fuss, just fun&quot; could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf.Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player&apos;s only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Soccer is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing. The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.</plot>

  <plot>In an adaptation certainly not endorsed by PBS, this game puts the player in the shoes of a sociopathic Beavis and Butthead-style radical stoner anarchist (of the ~1992 variety), hepped up on H/P/A t-files and prepared to vent his disgust at all the problems of the world on one moronic purple dinosaur and the other participants on his show, through doping with narcotics to sabotage and booby-traps to, most of all, cartoonishly stylized (more Bakshi than WB) and couldn&apos;t-care typo-ridden ultraviolence.The game plays almost as a multiple-choice test on the Jolly Roger&apos;s Cookbook, with player input restricted to selecting from a psychedelically-coloured text list how he or she intends to ruin various innocuous activities associated with the show, such as snack time (by injecting the orange with vodka, perhaps?), singing a song together (while substituting in obscene new lines) or visiting the zoo (and selling kids into slavery or feeding Baby Bop to an alligator while there.) (While taking the kids to a GWAR concert is undeniably subversive, it does strain the suspension of disbelief.)The player is given regular status reports on the current state (of health and sobriety) of all the kids on the show; the ultimate goal is to render the entire cast unfit to perform further by the end of a week&apos;s worth of infiltrated episodes, following which the player may get to gather huge bonus points in an endgame sequence where Barney is fought to the death in a shopping mall.Though the gameplay is single-player, as a BBS door game callers would compete with each other for showings on the high-score table; in later versions of the software, dedicated fans were also granted the opportunity to submit scripted modules consisting of new, further deranged anti-social activities to run the kids through.</plot>

According to legend, no man can be defeated when he has the Spear. Hitler believes himself to be invincible with the power of the Spear as his brutal army sweeps across Europe.Your mission is to infiltrate the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and recapture the Spear from an already unbalanced Hitler. The loss of his most coveted weapon could push him over the edge. It could also get you ripped to pieces.Spear of Destiny is a prequel to Wolfenstein 3-D. It is a first-person shooter that uses the same engine and has the same gameplay, however the game is not divided into 6 separate episodes - all the levels are one long episode. The enemies and weapons are pretty much the same as in Wolfenstein 3-D. Only new additions include: new bosses, a new type of enemy, and a new pickup (a large box of ammo).</plot>

  <plot>Try to find the treasures someone has dropped down to the maze. There&apos;s no enemies or any dangers in the game, so you can examine the maze as slowly and thoroughly as you want.Treasure hunt is a very simple maze game, but what makes it somewhat special is that it&apos;s portrayed in first person perspective (remember that this game was published 1982). The maze is generated randomly everytime you start a new game, so there&apos;s endless amount of mazes for a diehard player to conquer ;)</plot>

  <plot>Plot: You play as Nick, and you must save your true love, Xianna, from the hands of gangsters. Gameplay: You choose from five different cities to start out in. They are, in order of difficulty, Denver, Atlanta, Detroit, Los Angeles, and New York. The difficulty lies in the number of &quot;turfs&quot; there are in each city. For instance, Denver, the easiest, only has two &quot;turfs&quot;. This means that you must defeat two groups of thugs before you can beat Denver.Control: Controls are simple. You move with the arrow keys, kick with the &apos;alt&apos; key, and punch with the &apos;space&apos; key.

  <plot>A small little financial game- something like the old Lemonade Stand games, except for the drug sales, robberies, shootouts with the police.No graphics- everything takes place on a text screen. You start out with $500, in one of 8 cities (Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, and Washington DC). Buy and sell 8 different types of drugs (Ludes, Speed, Grass, Crystal, Acid, Heroin, Crack, Cocaine- in order from lowest to highest in street value.) Sock some money into the bank so you don&apos;t lose it due to robbery; visit loan sharks (and try to pay them off before they beat you up); buy overcoats to increase your &quot;holding&quot; potential, and more.You also attempt to build your reputation- but the higher your reputation, the more cops on your tail. You can try to run or fight the cops (and if you&apos;ve got the rep, bring along friends)- but fights with large numbers of cops can quickly kill you, and trying to run from large numbers of cops can be nearly impossible.Drug prices fluctuate seemingly at random (but around a base point) when going from city to city, although large scale events like street raids, factory explosions, etc. can cause temporary price increases or decreases in one round while in the same city.</plot>

  <plot>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat &apos;em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama&apos;s island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a &quot;taunt&quot; that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it&apos;s game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</plot>

It centres around a man&apos;s efforts to attract her - suffice to say, he doesn&apos;t do so by offering her a can of Pepsi, and the game is not aimed at the young or prudish. Most of the game involves using multiple-choice dialogue to produce the correct outcome. You will visit bars, beaches, and many glamorous cities. There are also several sub-games, as you visit a casino, fend off love rivals, and face down smugglers.</plot>

They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.The second in the Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the AD&amp;D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp;amp;D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field.

  <plot>Daughter of the Serpent is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface.An exotic, ancient city bustling with life. A strange, unnatural creature. A murder. And you, on a business trip to Alexandria, Egypt, suddenly involved in the case of a mysterious cult that deals with strange forces. Take a piece of ancient Egyptian mythology, add a pinch of demonology a la Lovecraft, and mix with a decent dose of colonial middle-east romanticism -- those are the ingredients for the sinister adventure game Daughter of the Serpents.Daughter of the Serpents would be a pretty common adventure game, if it wasnÆt for one remarkable feature. Quite unusually for a pedigree adventure game, you have to design your character at the beginning of the game. You may chose a gender as well as one of six professions, ranging from traveller to private eye or occultist. Each category consists of four to five talents, in which you can then invest skill points. You may thus specialise your character in toxicology, let him learn the Arabian language, make him an excellent observer or an expert in necromancy. The talents have no influence on the plot, but a marginal one on the dialogues; you will get slightly different conversations depending on your knowledge of certain subjects. Your choice of profession, however, opens three slightly different approaches to the mystery, culminating in three different endings. Although the basic course of events does always stay the same, a few scenes are exclusive to each branch. Also, you will be accompanied by either the greek occultist Ariadne Elytis or the rational inspector Bimbashi Cameron. Check out the screenshots section for examples of different scenes.</plot>

  <plot>CHAMP Galaxia is a DOS shareware remake of Namco&apos;s classic 1980 Galaxian arcade shooter. Like the other games in CHAMProgramming&apos;s series of arcade remakes, it is remarkable for closely emulating the original, the smooth gameplay and two game modes, the original &quot;Classic&quot; and the enhanced &quot;Champ&quot; mode.The &quot;Classic&quot; mode plays and feels like the arcade machine, with very similar graphics, sound and gameplay: You play a spaceship, moving horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and shooting up at a bunch of Space Invaders-like aliens, which attack you in waves becoming harder and harder with the game.The &quot;Champ&quot; mode is an upgraded version of the classic game with new enemy types -- requiring more than one hit to destroy, or equipped with a cloaking device making them nearly invisible -- and a variety of power-ups for the player, with create an entertaining variant of the original game.Finally, the game features a variety of options -- one or two player modes, three difficulty settings, adjustable game speed, input by keyboard, mouse or joystick (Champ even released a &quot;Champ cable&quot; that allowed you to play the game with digital joysticks), and a high score table to round it all off.</plot>

  <plot>Battles of Napoleon is a historical wargame that lets you play either side in four of Napoleon&apos;s famous battles -- Auerstadt, Borodino, Quatre Bras, and the infamous Waterloo. Additionally, the game features a detailed scenario construction set that will allow you to design your own battles; everything from maps, to troop types, to weapon ranges and damage.Gameplay is turn-based, each turn consisting of different phases. During your turn, you can establish various objectives (map squares to occupy) for each unit or commander, move commanders between units, move a unit, change formation, and, of course, attack or retreat. The Borodino scenario is the smallest, and can be used as a &amp;quot;tutorial&amp;quot; of sorts before moving on to the larger, more complex scenarios. This is a game that fans can legitimately spend several hours on.The construction set allows, as you might expect, the creation of new scenarios for the game. In it, you will find the standard map and unit editors -- however, SSI allows you to make changes down to the weapon and unit type. This allows you to create scenarios for virtually any type of battle you can think of. As a silly example, it is possible to take the stock weapon &amp;quot;musket&amp;quot;, change the damage and range, and rename it &amp;quot;laser rifle&amp;quot; -- you then have the makings of a futuristic battle on your hands. (Of course, you would need to modify just about everything else to complete such a scenario... but you get the idea.)The learning curve for this game is steep; it is probably not for the faint of heart. Anyone who enjoys getting shoulder-deep into battlefield strategy and tactics, though, will feel very comfortable with this game.</plot>

  <plot>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you&apos;ll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes. You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you&apos;ll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</plot>

The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, &quot;Arcade&quot; allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas &quot;Grand Prix&quot; only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</plot>

You walk through the world in real time, passing texture-mapped buildings. The complex gameworld is over a mile squared and includes 40 miles of underground tunnels, as well a thousands of characters getting on with their daily business.When designing your character, you can customise his or her looks, and this affects your likelihood of being befriended or fought.

  <plot>Wizkid is the sequel to Wizball.This game deviates from the original in many ways. The screen does not scroll and Wizkid does not bounce around like his predecessor. You have full control over Wizkid and his movements. You have to move him around the screen, bashing into bricks (which comes in different shapes and sizes) so that the flying bricks collide with the onscreen enemies. Once you have cleared the screen of all the enemies, coins are dropped. You must pick these up quickly before the disappear and you proceed to the next screen. Killing multiple enemies with a single brick releases a bubble. this will sometimes offer a nose (to juggle bricks) or teeth (letting you grab hold of bricks), but more often it releases a coloured bubble. These go together to form tunes, as patterned at the top of the screen. Once you complete a tune, you are taken to a shop where you can buy items needed to progress to the next stage.If you bash all the bricks on a screen and haven&apos;t removed all the enemies, you are often taken to a puzzle screen, where you must solve Crossword 2091 for bonus money. You have a number of words you must put on the screen but they must all overlap each other and use each other&apos;s letters. Each move has a time limit. If you don&apos;t complete it you are taken back to the game.Wizkid also features pockets in which you can store items. When exiting a shop you can choose either to exit as a head, or a body, which is Wizkid with arms and legs. You are now limited by gravity and can jump around and use onscreen objects such as ringing bells or cranking wells. You may also come across interactive elements which you will need to use with items in your pockets. You will need to solve puzzles to complete most levels.</plot>

  <plot>Yaht is a computerized version of the classic dice game that Milton Bradley has popularized as Yahtzee. Players roll five dice trying to get certain combinations for their scorecard. Players may reroll any of the five dice twice after the first roll. (They may also choose to stop rolling at any point before that.) Deciding where to put a score can be just as important as actually rolling a certain combination. If a player rolls particularly well, he can get bonus points.The game was designed for PC/XT/AT computers with any kind of monitor. The graphics are made up of &quot;ANSI characters,&quot; which allow for a more colorful display than CGA would have. Simple sound is provided by the PC speaker.</plot>

The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots.To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.</plot>

You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow&apos;s neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.</plot>

  <plot>In the future, the Earth is a wasteland, unable to sustain human life any longer. Mankind&apos;s only hope is to find a new world to colonize. Giant transport ships are launched, each carrying 10 million people. Sent ahead of each of these ships is a Trailblazer-class scout. Controlling one of these Trailblazers, it&apos;s the players mission to find a suitable planet for a new colony, to scout for natural resources and to deal with various alien species, who might be both friend or foe.From a robot-controlled home base, the Trailblazer starts exploring the nearby star systems (two different star clusters are selectable, representing different difficulty levels). Planets in uninhabited systems can be claimed for their natural resources. If aliens already inhabit a system, diplomatic negotiations can be opened. Since the resources of the uninhabited systems won&apos;t be enough for sustaining a colony, trade agreements with the aliens are necessary. Each alien species has its own attitude and quirks. Not all of them are friendly, and some might demand that the player attacks their enemies before they agree to trading or a peace treaty.If hostilities with aliens begin, there are a variety of combat options. The Trailblazer itself is rather slow and sluggish, but is equipped with a powerful main gun and a gun turret. It can also launch remote-controlled combat chassis in various configurations: as a guided missile, a kamikaze ship, or a fighter, the latter two being controllable by the player.The systems of the Trailblazer (the weapons, shields, sub- and faster-than-light engines) are powered by various parts. On the engine room screen, these parts can be individually mounted or removed. Combat may damage the parts. The same parts are used by different systems of the ship, so they can be moved around to improve one system at the expense of another. New and replacement parts can be collected from the wreckage of destroyed alien ships and space stations, or be acquired through trading.</plot>

  <plot>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones. Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain. The only problem? At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance. Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present. You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you&apos;re lucky enough to find it. The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs. An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.</plot>

  <plot>Face Off! is a hockey game by developers MindSpan, who are better known for their HardBall series of baseball games. Play an exhibition game, an entire season or go straight to the playoffs and lead your team to the Stanley Cup. For the basic hockey gameplay a traditional side view is used, but whenever you or your opponent shoots at the goal the game switches to the special Shot Cam view. Occasionally when someone commits a nasty foul the game turns into a one-on-one fighting game; he who wins the fight can stay on the ice while the loser must spend some time in the penalty box.Face Off! can be played with realistic rules, relaxed rules or with no rules at all. Other options available include the number of players per team, difficulty &amp;amp; period length and whether or not you control the goalie during the Shot Cam mode.Some minor coaching and management options are also included. You can design your own plays in the playbook, modify your lines, move players form your minor league team to your major league team and vice versa and make trades with the other teams in the league.Face Off! doesn&apos;t have a NHL license, so all players and teams are fictional. One does have the option to rename teams &amp;amp; players however. Multiplayer gaming comes in the form of a two player cooperative or competitive mode. Non-networked of course.</plot>

  <plot>Space... the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its 5-year mission: To seek out new life and new civilizations, to explore brave new worlds, to boldly go where no one has gone before. Based on the 1960s Star Trek TV Series, Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise are representatives of the United Federation of Planets. Their role in space is that of explorers as well as a military presence. The Enterprise routinely encounters strange adventures and bizarre situations, each laid out as a separate &quot;episode&quot; which must be played in order. The first episode involves the USS Enterprise being called to a world to investigate strange &quot;demons&quot; have appeared from the mines and begun attacking the settlers.Star Trek: 25th Anniversary is a combination of a point-and-click, side-scrolling adventure game and a first person starship simulator. This tie-in actually missed the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek&apos;s TV debut by half a year (nearly 3 years in the case of the Amiga version), but it uses the original series&apos; characters and settings. Players directly control Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, and are able to give orders to other crewmembers. While the enterprise is on a peaceful mission, combat is possible. A new game begins on the bridge of the Enterprise, seen from a 3rd person view of Kirk, but a first person view out the viewscreen of the Enterprise. When on board the ship, Kirk can contact Chekov to assign a designation, raise shields or begin combat, contact Sulu to engage warp or adjust magnification, contact Spock to scan for data and search for keyword information, contact Uhura to deal with communications, and contact Scotty to change power allocation and repair damage and beam down to a planet. During combat, the player steers the Enterprise manually and is able to turn in 720 degrees of direction as well as increase or decrease speeds. Weaponry includes phaser banks which draw from the ship&apos;s energy and proton torpedoes which are in limited supply.The adventuring bulk of the game comes in the form of many landing party missions, in which the player beams down to the surface of a planet and explores the situation. Kirk can move about on the screen, other crew members automatically follow him. From the menu, he chooses a body part to perform an action: eyes represent looking, mouth represents speaking, one hand represents using items (and crewmembers) while another is to pick up objects. Kirk carries an inventory of items collected which can be accessed and used at any time. In most missions Kirk will carry a communicator to contact the ship and a phaser weapon which can be set to &quot;stun&quot; or &quot;kill&quot;, The point-and-click adventure has different solutions to problems, but the ideal goal of the federation is to solve things non-violently. Performance is rated accordingly as well as being based on how many extra discoveries and advances made and interaction with different beings, including aliens. The surroundings are all based on styles from the TV series and solutions to puzzles involve the skills of multiple crew members.</plot>

You know it, or should!The &quot;Deluxe&quot; mode has the same graphics as the &quot;Classics&quot; version, but adds more features and an intermission.The &quot;Champ&quot; mode is an upgraded version of the classic game, featuring colourful VGA graphics, different types of aliens (some which break out of the formation and attack, others who take more than one shot to destroy, etc.), a much more dangerous UFO and more powerful weapons (you can shoot fireballs, destroying an entire column, and launch guided missiles).Finally, the game features a variety of options -- one or two player modes, three difficulty settings, adjustable game speed, input by keyboard, mouse or joystick (Champ even released a &quot;Champ cable&quot; that allowed you to play the game with digital joysticks), and a high score table to round it all off.</plot>

To do this you&apos;ll have to manage the water supply properly, make sure the city is policed well, and provide adequate education, entertainment, baths, and temples (which also hold your money and can be robbed if you don&apos;t have enough protection).At some point, possibly more then once, you&apos;ll have to defend your province from invading tribes that don&apos;t really want you there. You also have to connect all the little villages in the province with roads and make some industry, like stone mining, grapes, etc. for which you can then create markets in your city. When you have achieved the necessary requirements, you&apos;ll be able to start all over again in a new and more challenging province. Do well enough and you can become the new Caesar.</plot>

The former goals can also be pursued by 2 to 4 players cooperatively on one computer, or they can decide to play a melee round in which each player tries to do the other teams in.Every single Clonk can be controlled by the player, in contrast to the group-wise controls of the predecessors. Clonks also learned to swim and dive, dig in different directions and build bridges. 4-Way scrolling allows for bigger scenarios filled with new raw materials and endangered by volcanoes, earthquakes and hostile creatures.A variety of new buildings, weapons, materials, vehicles and weather conditions to help or hinder the players actions make the game more complex and put a heavier weight on strategic thinking than classic Clonk games.The game also includes a mission editor, with which players can create their own scenarios by creating a landscape and defining every aspect including weather, initial property and goals.</plot>

  <plot>In a sense, Fiddle is like a jigsaw puzzle: the player is presented with a series of abstract shapes on a grid and the challenge is to move and rotate them all (without resulting in invalid positions, such as overlapping pieces) into such an arrangement that they ultimately form a complete, filled square. This is relatively trivial on the first tutorial level, but the difficulty escalates through 26 levels, one for every letter of the alphabet. The fewer moves used in the solution of a level, the higher the final score, hence the author encourages a strategic approach of contemplation over a trial-and-error system.</plot>

He can occasionally find special power ups that grant him unlimited flying power, giving him the ability to navigate through tricky mazes.Aside from the platforming action, the other notable feature of Rayman is its large, detailed and vibrant graphics, which have helped it to stand out from most other similar games in the genre.</plot>

  <plot>His girlfriend had always had great expectations and one day, by an incredible chance an apple which has fallen right down our caveman&apos;s head creates a thought of an aircraft that he can use to earn money. So he makes the machine and uses it for the transport--for picking the other cave friends up and dropping them to their desired destinations. Ugh! is an action game where you must complete 69 levels, riding inside a pedal-powered helicopter to pick up passengers and carry them to their destinations. Each level is made of a series of platforms, with several cave entrances. Cavemen walk out of the caves and loudly announce where they want to go. You have to land your helicopter taxi next to the passenger and wait until he crawls inside (if you land on him, he&apos;ll fall into the water at the bottom of the level, although he can still be rescued) and then fly to the cave that he wants to get to. Controlling the vehicle is a bit complicated - you cannot directly fly up or down; instead, you have to keep pedalling to fly up, and cease pedalling when you want to go downwards. Bumping into a wall too hard will cause a game over and force you to restart the level. There is also a time limit for each level. To finish a level, you have to serve a number of customers. There are some dinosaur adversaries on certain levels - a pterodactyl which appears unexpectedly and flies across the screen, and a triceratops which becomes agitated when you land near and charges at your taxi. As you pedal, you exert energy. To refill your energy so that you can keep pedalling, you can pick up a rock and toss it at a tree, making a fruit drop down. Eat the fruit to get more energy.</plot>

  <plot>Four Indoor Sports are compiled in this entry to DesignStar&apos;s SportTime line of recreations. Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey, Darts and (except on the Commodore 64) Ping Pong are featured. The menus and options screens have the same feel as Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game.Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the results unfold from the bowler&apos;s view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible.Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart&apos;s curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart&apos;s approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed.Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top.Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button.</plot>

  <plot>Star Saga One is the first of an innovative role-playing trilogy (yet only two titles were released). It attempts to bring the atmosphere of pen &amp; paper RPG and Choose Your Own Adventure game books to the computer, while the more tedious task of book-keeping are made by the computer -- truly &quot;Interactive Literature&quot;..The game comes with two large fold-out maps and tokens to be moved around the map, as well as a dozen booklets containing text passages to be read when the game tells you to do so. (Much like the early Epyx Dunjonquest games.)When starting play, you can choose one to six players from preset character. The interesting thing is that the characters are meant to be played by separate players, sitting together in front of the computer, as in a pen &amp; paper RPG. The difference is that there is no party, as each player has different tasks and missions and moves around independent of the others.When playing, each player moves his token on the map, then enters the movements and actions into the program, which calculates all changes to character stats and inventory, calculates combat, and tells the player which text passage to read. While progressing, the players will make new discoveries, battle aliens, trade with other players and NPCs, and discover the plot of the game.</plot>

This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity.Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.</plot>

It is an open-ended hack-and-slash through a multilevel dungeon with a party of 1-6 characters, chosen from possible classes including Fighters, Priests and Thieves. They will gain experience, jewelry and armor as the adventure progresses, but they will also age and may eventually die. Spells are triggered through typing their activation codes. The party can be changed before every trip to the dungeon by dropping off / picking up characters from the local tavern.</plot>

  <plot>As the name indicates, Corsarios is a game focused on sea affairs, which consists of two independent parts. On the first one, you will be on a wild island, a place in which we will have to face endless hordes of pirates whose only obsession will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island.The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.</plot>

You seek the truth, and revenge, and must work your way up the conspiracies ladder by arresting hackers and drug suppliers in order to get to the major drug lords that corrupt Calia.The game features some interesting storyline background, and good artistic backgrounds, flirting with Japanese anime.It plays as cinematic-backdrop shooter, much like Virtua Squad series, for example, but a little more complex.

  <plot>Tubes is a shareware color matching puzzle game. The main screen shows a series of overlapping transparent tubes climbing from the bottom and curving at the top towards the center. Colored balls, or elements as the game calls them, travel through these tubes to their exit holes.The objective is to catch the falling spheres with a test tube, moving it sideways underneath the tubes exits with the mouse, keyboard or joystick. The test tube can hold up to five elements. The player has to press a button and drop the elements inside a beaker at the bottom, aligning them vertically, horizontally or diagonally by three or more of the same color. Every level has a number of drops allowed, and when the player fails to catch too many elements the game is over.Besides the elements, special balls also appear randomly inside the tubes that help or hinder the player. The multicolored element acts as a wildcard, and can be matched with any color. The F element removes space inside the test tube. The M element fills the test tube with assorted balls. The C element creates a gray ball that can&apos;t be matched.The game comes with two modes. In endurance mode, the goal is to make as many points as possible, by making matches until all the allowed drops are spent. In wave mode, each level (or &quot;wave&quot;) has objectives, like making a specific type of match, that must be completed before finishing and moving to the next one.</plot>

The game is viewed with an isometric perspective. Three buttons controls the ability to tackle, pass and kick the ball, sprint, breakout of a tackle and change selected player depending on the whether the team is attacking or defending. A timed gauge system is used for place kicks (restarts and conversion attempts).The game features the official ARL (Australian Rugby League) licence and so includes all official team names and badges etc. from that league. The State of Origin team competition is also included under the licence. The Super League (Europe) licence was not obtained, and hence that league appears as Europe League in the game, with team names being the town/city where they are based. Also present are a number of international teams and an EA Sports All-Star team. Friendly matches can be set up with any combination of teams.The game features a team editor, allowing custom player names to be used.</plot>

The game features &quot;special events&quot; similar to Sid Meier&apos;s Railroad Tycoon, which require quick changes in the plane operations to accommodate them. Other important industry-specific activities include designing global routes and paying for landing rights, tinkering with plane layouts and determining fares for each leg.

  <plot>This multi-genre game represents famous historical events of World War II called D-Day and related to operation &quot;Overlord&quot;, when Allies attack Axis massively in France.The game proposes to be a general in command of Allies group and optionally perform certain actions by yourself also. Such actions include:1. Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically important places; 2. Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper; 3. Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier; 4. Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French village.All kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later.Multiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as &apos;Hitler does not wake up&apos;.</plot>

  <plot>In 2043, an alien probe originating from Alpha Centauri is detected in our solar system. Attempts at a peaceful first contact fail and a missile barrage is launched at Earth. Earth&apos;s ABM systems successfully destroyed all but one missile, and its sheer power of destruction prompted the world governments to invest significant effort into combating this threat from the stars. Within several years, great technological leaps were made and space travel was significantly improved upon. Battlefleets were assembled and dispatched across the vast distances of space to combat the alien menace.In 2119, fearing extinction, Earth built gigantic seedships designed as &quot;arks&quot; to propel people and the sum of human knowledge across the stars. One of these seedships, the UNS Calypso, is sent to Beta Caeli star system which is the farthest colony attempted yet. In 2135, a second seedship, the UNS Tantalus, is dispatched to the same destination in order to better the chances of human survival. The Tantalus is equipped with a more advanced fusion engine and thus will reach Beta Caeli some 21 years ahead of the Calypso.You are the captain of the Calypso. You&apos;ve just been awakened from stasis and your ship is orbiting the most habitable planet in the system. There is no sign of the Tantalus. All you have are some 5000 colonists, past radio transmissions and a few key advisers to help you colonize this new unfamiliar solar system.The gameplay includes building and maintaining bases on alien planets and space stations, managing resources, exploring the planet, and the research of new scientific discoveries.Your success in managing your colony and the progressive, branching storyline will ultimately determine whether mankind survives, or is lost to the ages.</plot>

  <plot>A surreal and very original game by Geoff CrammondThe game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. &quot;Energy&quot; plays an important role, there&apos;s a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you&apos;re caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you&apos;ll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a &quot;robot hull&quot; must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a &quot;Meanie&quot; which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.</plot>

  <plot>From the Racter FAQ:In 1984, William Chamberlain published a book called &quot;The Policeman&apos;s Beard is Half Constructed&quot; (Warner Books, NY. 0-446-38051-2, paper $9.95). The introduction claims: &quot;With the exception of this introduction, the writing in this book was all done by computer. The authorship is attributed to RACTER, originally &quot;written in compiled BASIC on a Z80 with 64k of RAM.Racter strings together words according to &quot;syntax directives&quot;, and the illusion of coherence is increased by repeated re-use of text variables. This gives the appearance that Racter can actually have a conversation with the user that makes some sense, unlike Eliza, which just spits back what you type at it. Of course, such a program has not been written to perfection yet, but Racter comes somewhat close. Since some of the syntactical mistakes that Racter tends to make cannot be avoided, the decision was made to market the game in a humorous vein, which the marketing department at Mindscape dubbed &quot;tongue-in-chip software&quot; and &quot;artificial insanity&quot;.</plot>

  <plot>Formula 1 Grand Prix is the first instalment of what would quickly become the Formula 1 simulation series for the PC in the 1990&apos;s. Designed and programmed by racing game specialist Geoff Crammond (REVS, Stunt Track Racer), Grand Prix 1 did not only introduce a multitude of features previously unknown to computer racing simulations, but also sported a physics engine that was, at its time, unmatched in its complexity and realism. Grand Prix 1 features:1. 3D graphics out of filled, unshaded polygons on PC and Amiga - the PC version has pavement and lawn textures. The sheer number of track-side details (down to billboards and camera cranes) forced any computer below a decent 386 DX to its knees.2. Working rear mirrors. Though they show only cars and no scenery, they are invaluable for blocking overtakers.3. Collisions with flying debris and actual crude damage models: wings are visibly bent after crashes.4. Wet weather that influences traction. No rain graphics, but a fog effect obscures your vision when you drive in another car&apos;s splash water.5. An extensive tuning part that greatly influences the performance of your car. In-race setup allows you to adjust gear ratios, brake balance, wing downforce and tires during each visit to the box.6. Six optional driving aids that help F1 rookies finish their race: toggle best line and suggested gear displays to learn track tactics, or have auto brakes, auto gears, self-righting spins and indestructability improve your driving.7. A replay system that lets you watch race scenes from three different views, including track-side cameras.Formula 1 Grand Prix includes all 16 international GP circuits of 1991. You may drive them in quick race mode, single race or a full championship. The 18 teams and 35 drivers and their performance are based on the 1991 season, but the game doesn&apos;t include real names. You can edit and save team and driver names by hand.While the Amiga version allows multiplayer races in hotseat mode, the PC version originally had solo races only. In 1993, the v1.05 update added modem support (and a couple of other improvements). Find it in the related links section.</plot>

  <plot>Hole-In-One Miniature Golf provides an overhead view of each hole. The game play is controlled entirely with the mouse. You place the ball on the starting pad and click the left mouse button. Once you have placed the ball, &quot;stretch&quot; a line from the ball to the pointer. The direction the line is pointing is the direction the ball will go. The length of the line or the distance between the pointer and the ball is relative to the power on the shot. Once you are satisfied, click the left mouse button to putt the ball. You are allowed to go three shots over par. Any more than that and you will get a penalty stroke and must advance to the next hole (or player). You can also get one stroke penalty for going into a water hazard. Your scorecard will be displayed after the first nine holes but can be viewed at anytime using the Options Menu. After completing the course the scorecard will be displayed again. You can print your scores or exit to continue. The game features five complete 18-hole courses with different themes including a Tutorial Course that walks the player through every aspect of game play, a Classics Course which is patterned after the basic traditional miniature golf course, an Intermediate Course that adds more obstacles, elevations and difficulty, an adventurous Fantasy Course with designs ranging from castles to pinball and the Expert Course for those who master the game. The game can be installed on a hard drive.</plot>

  <plot>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough &quot;proof&quot; of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won&apos;t be easy since the Space Mutants are &quot;using&quot; human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</plot>

  <plot>This game consists of ten arcade mini-games based on the Don Bluth animated movie with the main characters voiced by Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLouise. Charlie the dog, a good guy but a bit of a scoundrel, is bumped off by an evil &apos;crime lord&apos; of a dog and ends up in heaven but yearns to go back to earth to set things right. The game starts there, if you play the story mode. Plot points from the movie are used to loosely tie the mini-games together, but you can also pick your own game. Among the different mini-games, there&apos;s a Hangman clone, a session of The Towers of Hanoi, a run around the city to try to find the girl&apos;s house, a maze-crawl through a ventilation system, and a Rat Race that pits you as a rat called Squad Car trying to win a race against three to five other rats. There are three difficulty levels to choose from.</plot>

Those who regard everything else as a time-filling exercise between these ancient duels between colonial power and one-time convict dumping ground will appreciate this release from Audiogenic.Battle For the Ashes was released at budget price, as a cut down of the company&apos;s cricket game, released under various licenses worldwide offering only 5-day matches between England and Australia. Gameplay is unchanged, with batting involving precise timing and stroke selection, and bowling involving waggling to set speed or spin, with control over where the ball pitches.</plot>

  <plot>(From the Infocom Home Page)Once upon a time, a man moved from one apartment in London to another. He dutifully notified everyone of his new address, including his bank; he went to the bank and filled out a change of address form himself. The man was very happy in his new apartment. Then, one day, the man tried to use his credit card but couldn&apos;t. He discovered that his bank had invalidated his credit card. Apparently, the bank had sent a new card to his old address. For weeks, this man tried to get the bank to acknowledge his change of address form. He talked to many blank officials, and filled out new forms, and tried to get a new credit card issued, but nothing worked. The man had no credit, and the bank behaved like, well, a bank. It&apos;s a sad story, one that gets replayed every day for millions of people worldwide. Of course, sometimes it&apos;s not a bank at fault: sometimes it&apos;s the postal service, or an insurance company, or the telephone company, or an airline, or the Government. But all of us, at one time or another, feel persecuted by a bureaucracy. You begin in your new house. As per the letter in your package, you will fly to Paris just as soon as you get some money to take you to the airport. That money should be in today&apos;s mail, so you should be off soon... unless, of course, there&apos;s been some problem with the mail. Oh by the way: The man in our story about the bank was Douglas Adams, the principal author of this game. The bank did finally send him a letter, apologizing for the inconvenience - but they sent it to his old address.</plot>

  <plot>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you&apos;d expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</plot>

  <plot>Scorpio was one of the most beautiful space colonies of all the galaxy and its raw materials were one of the fundamental points of the terrestrial wealth. But, one day, the explosion of a Supernova altered the genes of the inhabitants of the planet, turning them into strange beings who hate the human specie and want to destroy it. In such a situation, the Earth space services sent a series of scientists in order to study the mutation and the way for solving it. But they were captured and forced to work for the scorpians in the creation of a definitive weapon that would make disappear our planet of the Solar System. Only a Rainbow-Command could avoid it and your help will be indispensable for the attainment of the mission.The game is composed of two parts, within which there are two introduction sub-games that will allow you to obtain some additional lives before starting the game itself. On the first part you will have to face a series of natural obstacles while shooting to everything with strange looks, for that, you count with a laser and a cosmic hammer, but you also should take batteries for your portable radar that informs to you of the enemy situation. Once finished this part, you will start the last one, in which you must be careful in not crashing your newly-acquired motorcycle with the multiple obstacles you will find, at the same time you get rid of the mutants, whereas you go to the laboratory where you will have to liberate the kidnapped scientists. It won&apos;t be easy - you will find the head of the mutants who is anxious to give you a warm welcome.</plot>

  <plot>Squash simulations are something of a rarity, and it was this nichΘ that Krisalis aimed one of their many sports simulations into. The rules of squash are accurately recreated, with a realistic court layout (viewed isometrically) and a need to hit legal shots. Three different ball speeds, variable match lengths and an &apos;easy&apos; mode are on offer. Different tournament types are on offer, at &apos;club&apos; and &apos;tournament&apos; levels, with a customisable ladder system of multiple divisions to rise up. There is a full roster of opponents to play in one-off or tournament modes.</plot>

  <plot>The premise of Nihilist is simple: The player controls a spaceship which has to beat deathmatches in an arena called Kraal. The gameplay is a mix between the classic games Beamrider and Star Wars. In Beamrider the player is on the bottom of a grid and shoots enemies on the upper part. Star Wars had among other things a sequence were the player flies in pseudo 3D through the Death Star.In the 25 levels the player duels one enemy each. Additionally there are other ships which shoot both opponents and asteroids which either split when shot or give extras like better armor. There are three arenas: horizontal, vertical and spherical. Every fight costs credits so the player has to pick up money symbols during the fight. When having more money he can spend it on weapon and armor upgrades.The soundtrack features 17 songs from bands like Dog eat Dog, Pop will eat itself and Sugar Ray and can be replaced with another music CD.</plot>

  <plot>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.</plot>

  <plot>Play one of the three evil wizards all competing to find the magical talisman. To do so, the player must hatch, raise, breed dragons, and use them to spread terror and power across the land! Use these dragons and spells to conquer or help numerous villages and cities across the land while devastating the other wizards also seeking control of the land.Dragon Lord introduces different levels of gameplay, which may be categorized as the following:1. AlchemyThe game introduces a complex process of alchemy. Different ingredients have positive and negative results in combination of different types of Magick equipment used for it. Use alchemy to strengthen (or even weaken) own dragons or use them to cast spells at surrounding villages and cities (as well as some alchemical spells for the player&apos;s own benefit). Creating a too powerful spell in the Magick Laboratory may introduce an unpleasant explosion in the lab. Ingredients may be obtained through villager tribute or purchase from traveling merchants. Note: The game is almost impossible to play without the Alchemical Table of Ingredients.Dragon BreedingThe player may breed several individual dragons in the castle. Each require nurturing and patience before they can hatch and even more so after they hatch! Use alchemy spells to help strengthen the dragon eggs (or they may not hatch at all!).Dragon Missions and Political MapThis feature gives a top-down perspective of the political map around the land. Send dragons to wreck havoc and terror to the surrounding villages and cities, or use them to explore the region and even protect villages and cities from enemy dragons! Attacking villages and cities may prompt them to surrender themselves under the player&apos;s control, providing the damage done is sufficient enough. This is also where the player may control the taxation of villages and cities (under player control) as well as any other information regarding them.Dragon Combat!Though optional, the player may enter manual combat (as to automatic combat) and enter a top-down, side-scrolling (vertical) arcade combat when attacking villages or cities. Here the player basically uses a dragon to burn anything that remotely looks like a structure.Note: If there is an enemy dragon near the area, the enemy dragon will come to the defense of that village or city!</plot>

  <plot>The time for resurrecting historical events has come. Panzer General was one of the first games (if not the first) that actually gave you the ability to play for the Nazis, and yet succeed where Hitler failed. Having total and complete control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor victory).The game&apos;s quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with &quot;circled&quot; animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you can change to suit your preferences.A turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn&apos;t go up infinite). The first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series using the &quot;General&quot; name.</plot>

  <plot>The object of the game is to make a fortune by acquiring as many companies as posible within each industry while building a monopoly. There are 12 different industries and the player begins holding one company in each. First, the player must raise funds through financing (either a bank loan, venture capitalists, or junk bonds), stock trading, and later greenmail (above market offers for stock the player holds, usually to stave off a takeover). The player only deals with one industry at a time, but can change at any time and use funds gained in one to take over companies in another. It sounds simple, but there is a hostile corporation in each industry that is also trying to take over other companies. Additionally, there are three possible responses to a takeover bid: accept, offer too low, and no deal. In the case of &quot;no deal,&quot; only a hostile takeover can be done, and the company will use takeover blocking tactics. And if a hostile corporation gets controlling interest in your company, you can no longer buy stock in that industry. Luckily, you can also use takeover blocking tactics.</plot>

  <plot>It might be a &quot;battle of colours&quot;, two &quot;enemies&quot; engaging in a &quot;fight&quot; to &quot;conquer the territory&quot; on the &quot;battlefield&quot;. Or, despite Infogrames&apos; martial marketing efforts, 7 Colors might just be a puzzle game with brightly colored diamonds. In the wake of Alexey Pajitnov&apos;s block-busting Tetris, Infogrames licensed another Russian mathematician&apos;s concept for a game of logics and dexterity: Two players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangles of seven different colors, and take turns in picking one of these colors. All diamonds of that color bordering on the player&apos;s territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.Some quirks add tactical depth: The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between. In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure.7 Colors can be played against the computer or a human opponent, even over a local network - a rare feature at the time. Ambitious players may design their own boards with the included editor.</plot>

  <plot>Pick &apos;n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn&apos;t match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can&apos;t be moved.</plot>

The challenge is to reach the Premier League and survive.Most of the standard features of management games are present, including pre-match tactics (which are fairly customizable), a full transfer market including short-term loan deals, detailed player statistics (presented visually), ground improvements and coaching.Playing the matches is optional, as you can simply watch instead. There are 4 playing views, and you can play in position or as a team. Initially your player is by far the best in the team, so choose his position and use him wisely. Once you reach retirement age you can only play the matches for 3 out of every 4 seasons (which is poorly explained by an &apos;assistant manager&apos; concept, but is more likely an attempt to make the game harder. This would make little sense though, because scoring is very, very hard in player-manager mode).Before each match you get a video report from renowned pundit Alan Hansen, as well as some form notes which are said to be Hansen&apos;s.</plot>

And when times are rough, the American army relies on their special forces. A small group of highly trained, superbly skilled, well-armed and clean-shaven elite soldiers boldly go where no man has gone before. At least no honest man.Special Forces let&apos;s you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of Jagged Alliance, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green.16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist&apos;s arctic ice to the drug cartel&apos;s native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won&apos;t warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you&apos;ll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.</plot>

  <plot>An Olympiad game simulating common winter game competitions - the Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge, 2-men Bobsled, Ski Jump, Cross Country, Biathlon and Speed Skating.The game features a basic 3D engine which allows to simulate slopes with ease, which enhances the gameplay of some events such as the Downhill. Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, relies on finding the faster trajectories in most events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge and Bobsled), pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and Biathlon), skill and timing (Ski Jump), with button mashing reserved for just one (speed skating). The player (up to ten) can select his (or her) competitor face and nationality from one of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different difficulty settings, different computer controlled athletes take part in the competition along the player.</plot>

  <plot>Elvira - a horror movie star, a witch, and your girlfriend - is in trouble. A demon Cerberus has kidnapped her in order to kill her and gain her power. To save Elvira, you arrive at the studios of Black Widow Productions, where she is being held. Unfortunately, the whole studio is filled with monsters, as the horror movie sets have turned real. Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the &quot;room&quot; icon to see all the items that you&apos;ve found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there&apos;s a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn&apos;t want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. Thanks to Elvira&apos;s spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don&apos;t use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What&apos;s more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don&apos;t waste them.</plot>

Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints.During dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character&apos;s weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.</plot>

  <plot>Simulating the struggle between the nations of the Star Trek universe, Begin: A Tactical Starship Simulation puts you in charge of a fleet or a single ship against adversaries of your choosing. Four nations are available for the player to choose from; Federation, Romulan, Klingon, and Orion. After selecting who you will play and who the computer will play as you will then need to select the ships involved. This step allows the player to adjust the difficulty of the game to their choosing. If you&apos;d like you can have a one-on-one battle or if you&apos;d rather have an all out war between nine ships on each side. It&apos;s also possible to have a battle where the odds are stacked in your favour or on theirs with completely adjustable numbers up to nine on each side. After the number has been decided upon you will have to select just which specific ships are engaged. The choice is yours from hulking freighters to agile birds of prey. Once all the variable have been decided on it is time to do battle.Concentrating more on the various surprises of battle Begin: A Tactical Starship Simulation does not allow players to place their ships wherever they like. Your ships and your enemies&apos; ships are placed at random places as shown on a small thumbnail and specified through written coordinates on the main play/command window. From this point on the strategies are all up to you. You may choose which weapons to fire with, where to move, and even choose to self destruct. Moves are made by typing out what you&apos;d like to do, for example; &quot;TORPEDO&quot; or &quot;TOR&quot; for short (the game understands three letter summary commands). At this point you will be prompted which bays to fire from or what spread to use (for PHASERS) etc. After this the game will perform the commanded move and the turn will be over. A summary of events and outcomes of the turn will be listed and a read-out of ship status will be updated. Random events such as weapon malfunction are possible and you may get reports from other parts of your ship by typing in the right command. Reports available include; Casualties, Engine Temperatures, and lots more.Battles continue until one entire fleet is destroyed and a report is given at the end as to how you have performed.</plot>

  <plot>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a &quot;wire framed&quot; virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</plot>

  <plot>Subtitled &quot;Spellbound in the World of Nhagardia&quot;, this little-known Microprose title came out the same year as their classic &quot;Darklands&quot; but garnered none of the cult following associated with that title. Although it was a fairly standard RPG for its time graphically (256-color VGA top-down view), it had a few unique twists. As Prince of Alonia, you control a party of up to 10(!)characters, battling the evil lord Grimnoth in a standard fantasy setting. The game features &quot;Ultima-style&quot; character generation, in which your answers to situational questions help determine your character type (diplomat, warrior, thief, or wizard) and attributes. An immense number of skills and attributes, akin to that of Daggerfall or the later Realms of Arkania series, add variety to the gameplay, allowing puzzles to be solved in different ways. Dawdling endlessly in side quests to build up your party is not a good idea, as the player has 100 days to stop the encroaching Plague of Darkness, whose spread is shown graphically in the interface. Under the &quot;PAL system&quot;, characters not only have their own personalities (aggressive, cowardly), but will speak up and volunteer for tasks they are best-suited to perform (e.g., lockpicking, bribery).</plot>

  <plot>Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that&apos;s school&apos;s out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he&apos;ll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy&apos;s relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.</plot>

  <plot>Capture the Flag is a strategy game, where two teams, each consisting of a couple of people, try to capture the other&apos;s flag before the other team captures theirs. The game takes place on a large field, with various types of terrain. You control one of the teams; the other team can be either controlled by the computer, or by another human player. The game is turn-based. During each turn, you can move each of your characters. Each of them has a limited number of movement points, so you can only move them up to a limited distance. Note that you move slower or faster (use more or less movement points) depending on the terrain you&apos;re moving through.The playfield is divided into two sides, one for each team. Initially, you know what&apos;s on your side of the field, but the opponent&apos;s side of the field is shrouded in darkness. By exploring the opponent&apos;s terrain, you can uncover the terrain there (and hopefully find out where his flag is). If you spot the opponent&apos;s flag, capture it by moving one of your characters onto it. However, if the opponent&apos;s character notices you snooping on his side of the field and catches up with you, your character will be sent to &amp;quot;prison&amp;quot; (which means that he&apos;s out of the game). Of course, you can do the same to his men that you find on your side of the field. Note, however, that if your opponent finds your &amp;quot;prison&amp;quot;, he can free all his captured men. Trying to avoid notice by your opponents is a quite important factor. You can choose various modes of movement: when you run, you are fast, but more visible; if you&apos;re crawling, you&apos;re hard to see, but very slow (moving costs you more movement points). And vice versa - you don&apos;t always know where your opponent&apos;s men are, although you know where did you see them last.</plot>

Passing works in a similar way to Sensible, but requiring a longer tap, and giving more versatility in where the pass is placed.

To do so, you&apos;ll have to complete over 60 levels. Each level is made of a bunch of thin, floating platforms. When you approach the edge of a platform, you do not fall off - rather, you begin walking upside-down on the other side! Instead of jumping, you &quot;reverse the gravity&quot; of your croc, causing him to fall up or down until he lands on a platform. You goal on each level is to light up all the bulbs by bumping them with your head. If you hit the bulb three times it will be completely lit up. Some bulbs are invisible on higher levels. There are also foes who want to stop you and who sabotage your efforts by bumping into the bulbs you&apos;ve lit, turning them off. Your foes can walk on both sides of the platforms just as you and can jump from platform to platform just as you, so watch out! The game can be played by 2 players, so if you are Funk then your friend is Punk and you can challenge each other in scores.</plot>

Each playfield represents a certain period of the human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until it logically finishes. The tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in another place based on the player&apos;s strategy in the way to do not block the path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which may influence on moving/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and they should be avoided in any possible way.Finishing the level will give you the code, which may be used later to access this level.

  <plot>In this puzzle board game you should swap the tiles to make the sequence of tiles of the same color to eliminate them.Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.</plot>

  <plot>Norumbega was a peaceful land. But all is not well in Norumbega as, Fang Duck, the evil ruler of the Dark Quarter region decided to invade the rest of Norumbega. Fang Duck in his haste to fill the land with his duck minions overlooked the coastal home of Peach, our titular hero. Being the spryest land lobster in all of Norumbega, Peach, has been chosen by the leaders of the coastal town to take out Fang Duck and restore peace to the lands. Luckily for you Fang Duck expected no resistance!Peach The Lobster is an arcade platformer where you play the role of Peach. Peach the Lobster can jump around, and use his claw gun to hit enemies or monitors to release items like 1-up Lobsters, health-up shells and bonus points. Peach can also slide, run and duck under platforms and crevices. If your goal is a little higher than that well Peach can also double jump up there.There are four regions that Peach will have to traverse. Grasslands is where the adventure begins. Filled with lush foliage, waterfalls and hills, Grasslands is the main territory in Norumbega. When you arrive in the region of Atland be wary of currents and underwater hazards as this region mysteriously sank under water a thousand years ago. The Norumbegan Caves is where you will find yourself after that. These torch-lit caverns lead up to windswept mountaintops and are the last stop before The Techno-Castle. This wannabe-technologic wonder fort is the Fang Duck&apos;s lair and home to his bevy of futuristic minions including laser turrets, and robotic duck henchmen. Of course this all leads up to a final confrontation with the boss duck himself, Fang Duck.</plot>

  <plot>The player here controls a secret agent, represented by an &quot;X&quot; in the middle of a textmode map window, searching a randomly-generated maze of indestructible and destructible blocks for three randomly-assigned objects of international espionage, to be gathered in sequence.The player has a limited amount of moves, as measured in Oxygen, to navigate the (poison-gas-flooded) maze and locate the objects. This is complicated by the roving of sensor drones, &quot;x&quot;s and &quot;o&quot;s, who zap the agent and return him to his starting location (a tendency that can be used strategically in times of low oxygen.) The drones can be destroyed with a limited number of Ray-gun blasts, each of which clears the screen of enemies, while weak walls can be demolished through the use of limited supplies of TNT. Finally, the player has a certain quantity of Hints that can be employed in order to indicate where in the larger maze the current section shown on screen is situated. The player can also Teleport randomly around the level in search of his assigned objects, both through a limited personal supply and by finding telepads on the level. Oxygen, TNT, Hints and Ray-gun blasts also can be topped up by finding their power-ups while wandering, as well as the Map Enlarger power-up that briefly increases the amount of the maze that is revealed at once.The game will randomly generate six levels in total, each more unlikely to be survived than the last.</plot>

One day, Herbert suddenly disappears, with rumors saying the he left his wife and son behind to search for a lost treasure. Meanwhile, a magical wand called Eveline decides to rule the world out of boredom, using Bert to cast a petrifying spell on the marionettes of a traveling puppeteer and cause other mischief among the local population. Now, Bert must fix all the trouble caused by Eveline, and search for his missing father.Dracφ Historie is a Czech point-and-click adventure game, originally the first Czech CD game ever to be published in 1995, and later released as open-source freeware in 2006 by the original developer. It follows the standards of the genre, where the main objective is to collect a series of scenery objects and use them to solve puzzles. The inventory shows the interior of a brown sack, and can be accessed by placing the cursor on the top of the screen. A map showing an overhead view of the land can be summoned by positioning the cursor at the bottom. New places are automatically added to the map as the player explores the surroundings, allowing instantaneous travel to any of the previously visited locations.The dialogue with other characters uses the branching tree system implemented by several other games, where multiple questions and answers appear listed as options at the bottom and the player has to select one of them. There is no menu with verbs, instead all the actions are performed with the right mouse button, while the left one is used to get descriptions of objects and portions of the scenery.</plot>

  <plot>The follow-up to CJ&apos;s Elephant Antics, in which we find that The Hunter has kidnapped CJ&apos;s brothers and sisters and trapped them at various points around the USA. Needless to say, young CJ sets off to rescue them.The game is a standard platform title, in which you can shoot peanuts at your enemies, or use bombs you collect.You start with 9 lives, which sounds generous, but the levels are full of spikes and bad guys which can come to get you at any point. The enemies include policemen, Indians, dogs and burly American footballers (quite a stereotypical view of Americans there). Each level has a guardian at the end.</plot>

  <plot>Dark Sun: Shattered Lands is an AD&amp;D game based off of the Dark Sun campaign pack from TSR. In the beginning of the game, the player controls a party of gladiators. It opens up with a fight with a multitude of monsters in an arena. After the battle the party are sent back to the slave pens to wait for their next match. They talk to some of the other gladiators in the slave pens and escape (if they can) to help the free villages established by other escaped slaves. Eventually they must fight back against the totalitarian city-state of Draj and the large army they will soon send to wipe out all of the slave villages. The game has a mouse interface and is basically point and click to move around, equip the party, talk to people, pick up things, etc. The gameplay is faithful to AD&amp;D&apos;s rules in most cases.</plot>

  <plot>Sea Hunt is a computerized version of the classic board game, &quot;Battleship&quot;, for PC-DOS or MS-DOS. The player is pitted against the computer A.I. There is no two-player option. There are ten difficulty levels. Each player&apos;s fleet consists of eight ships, compared to the five featured in the board game version. These include an aircraft carrier, battleship, destroyer, cruiser, mine sweeper, submarine, spy ship and patrol boat. Because of the larger number of ships, the game also features a larger playing grid which measures 15 x 19 squares compared to the standard 10 x 10.Grid squares are selected by moving a cursor over the grid, either with the cursor (arrow) keys or using a joystick. There is no mouse support. When placing ships on the player&apos;s grid, they can be pivoted so that they are oriented either vertically or horizontally using the space bar.The computer A.I. elicits a personality of sorts, gloating every time it sinks a ship, and protesting when one of its ships is sunk. This can be turned off by those who find it annoying.</plot>

  <plot>In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player&apos;s should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball&apos;s movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz&apos; fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There&apos;s three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there&apos;s even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.</plot>

  <plot>This game&apos;s author, all of whose games deal in some fashion with space exploration, felt a certain systemic turn-based pause for reflection to be to the detriment of the wide array of starship captain simulators out there in the early &apos;80s. To help convey the stress and prompt the snap decisions needed in an emergency situation, Starship: Invasion was devised as a realtime simulator, of the Excalibur-class starship the H.I.M.S. Stinger.The typical, limited, options remain the same as in its mainframe-derived BASIC predecessors: firing photon torpedos or phasers, going to warp speed, raising and lowering shields. The display options similarly hold true to their classic roots, largely based on divining your sector neighbors and ship status by decoding numerical displays and interpreting coloured alerts. The player&apos;s ship can still recharge (&quot;Trillom&quot; energy reserves) at six friendly StarDocks, which remain targets for an invading force that comes piloting six different varieties of marauding enemy starships. .. just now you get a little less time to plot your next course of action.</plot>

As you rollerblade through the suburbs, city streets, beaches, and parks you can earn points by performing a variety of tricks and jumps. Additional points are earned by completing the course under the time limit. There are also several bonus rounds where you need to navigate through (or jump over) obstacles such as barrels or cones. In order to place in the super rollerblade challenge, you need to complete all of the events and the challenge with 10,000 points for third place, 15,000 for second, or 20,000 for first!

  <plot>The 5th Fleet is a hex-based strategical wargame based on the board game 5th Fleet. The game is designed for two players which both take the side of a war party - in matches of a larger scale one war party can include several different countries. The gameplay is strictly turn-based and every day is divided into six rounds (three for each player). Every turn is divided into three phases: submarines, ships and aircraft.During the phases the players use two different map screens for their planning: the strategic map shows the whole operational zone divided into several areas and the tactical map offers a closer look over one area. The basic orders the players have to give are moving (marking a unit and choosing the goal hex) and attacking (choosing which weapon is used on what target). During longer matches it is also important to take care of replenishment. While naval units have to be moved on the tactical map the players can use the strategic map to plan aircraft movement. As usual for these kind of games everything is represented with abstract symbols on the map.In single player the game features ten scenarios set in the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf with increasing difficulty. There the player takes the role of the American fleet and mostly fights against Russia.</plot>

  <plot>The world has been attacked by the three Serpent Riders from the Abyss. Their mysterious power makes people obey and follow them like sheep. Only the ancient Sidhe elves are immune to the Riders&apos; influence, which led to them being branded heretics. With most of their work done, the two elder Riders leave, leaving only D&apos;Sparil, the youngest and weakest Rider, behind to oversee the oppression. He sends the armies of the Seven Kings against the Sidhe, who have no choice but to extinguish the Seven Candles, vanquishing the armies. The retribution is swift and hard, and most of the elves are destroyed. Now, one of the last remaining Sidhe must take the fight to D&apos;Sparil himself, being the only hope his world has left.Heretic is the first game in the Heretic/Hexen franchise. It uses the engine from id Software&apos;s DOOM and transplants that game&apos;s first person shooter gameplay into a fantasy setting.Like DOOM, Heretic consists of three distinct episodes, playable in any order, the first being available as shareware. The hunt for D&apos;Sparil begins in the City of the Damned, continues in the alternate dimension of the Hell&apos;s Maw and comes to an end in The Dome of D&apos;Sparil. Every episode consists of nine levels, one of them a hidden one. The goal in each level is to find the exit, killing everything standing in one&apos;s way. Keys must be found and buttons pressed to advance. Enemies include gargoyles, golems, undead knights, sorcerers, ophidian beasts and more. Most enemies exist in several varieties: some have additional range attacks, others have ghost forms and are impervious to certain weapons.The weapon arsenal is large and varied: the basic weapons are a wooden staff and the Elvenwand that shoots low-damage magic bullets. More powerful equipment must be found: the Ethereal Crossbow dispenses a spread of arrows doing high damage, but at a low firing rate. The Dragon&apos;s Claw and Hellstaff shoot with a higher frequency: the Claw hits enemies instantly, the Staff&apos;s energy bullets need to travel to them first. The Phoenix Rod fires explosive charges and must be handled with care. The Firemace unleashes steel metal projectiles that bounce across the room towards the enemy. A better melee weapon than the wooden staff are the Gauntlets of the Necromancer, which dispense deadly energy.Heretic goes beyond DOOM in certain aspects. The engine has been enhanced with the ability to look up and down and the ability to fly, and wind currents pushing the player in (often unwanted) directions have been added. Also new is an inventory system. Many different power-ups can be collected and then be used at the correct time. These include health flasks, invisibility and invincibility upgrades, time bombs, and torches to light dark rooms. The Morph Ovum transforms enemies into chickens for easier dispatching, the Wings of Wrath allow one to fly, and the Tome of Power gives all weapons a substantial upgrade: projectiles become more powerful or split up upon impact; the Phoenix Rod becomes a flamethrower and the Gauntlets remove life force from an enemy and transfer it to the player.Heretic includes the same multiplayer options as DOOM: both cooperative team play and competitive deathmatch are included.</plot>

You will use your tactical skills in the overhead stages to plan your attack, however when the battles begin you&apos;ll have the ability to commandeer jeeps, tanks, helicopters and ground artillery units for close combat from the first-person perspective. Red Ghost is one of the early showcases of the CD-ROM format. By taking full advantage of the medium the developers were able to add Silicon Graphics cinematics and CD quality sound effects and music.</plot>

  <plot>Ryan, a bartender from a dystopian future can&apos;t sleep peacefully for months. His nights are sequences of nightmares and strange dreams, days with frequent black-outs with strange visions, until one night a figure in monk attire appears to him, and tells him the story of the seven evil ones, uniting to destroy to Dreamweb, the only barrier between the world and darkness. The monk makes a proposition: Ryan becomes the deliverer: the one who would keep the Dreamweb safe by killing those who try to destroy it.Descending into paranoia and just wanting dreams to stop, Ryan accepts the mission, then wakes up in a puddle of cold sweat, next to his beloved girlfriend in her house, and late for work. Again.DreamWeb is a top-down adventure game set in a gritty futuristic/dystopian city. Each location takes only a small portion of the screen without panning (except an optional small zoom window in the corner that follows the cursor), with the player interacting with objects and people by simply clicking them. Ryan has a limited inventory space, and as a lot of objects can be picked up (many without any use), the player must rationalize what might be useful and just filler. Dialogue is straight forward, with no options, but still required to advance in the game (to find new locations, for instance). In situations where many adventure games often feature an indirect approach to solve a problem, Ryan often faces himself with situations where it&apos;s &quot;killed or be killed&quot;, which result in deaths (sometimes of innocents).The story isn&apos;t much developed inside the game, but the original release of the game included Diary Of a (Mad?) Man, a 40-page diary telling the descent of Ryan into madness, or his destiny, written by Stephen Marley provides a complete background to the events leading to the start of the game.</plot>

You can move one or two fields in any direction. If you move one, you get the new one and the one you have filled stays untouched. If you jump two spaces, you loose the first one, and get only the second one. Every field that borders to the one you just came onto becomes yours. The winner is the one who has the most fields at the endgame, or the one that stand alone, in which case he gots all 58 fields.(Editor&apos;s Note: This game is very similar to Ataxx, except with a hexagon grid instead of a square grid.)</plot>

  <plot>This is a flight simulator which uses a slightly modified version of the RealSpace engine from Strike Commander. You play a World War 2 pilot and get to fly in various historic missions such as dogfights, bombing runs and missile attacks, many of which are based on real battles. The US and Japanese planes of the time, and their weapons, are brought to life. One thing that makes Pacific Strike unique is that rather than a simple retelling of historical battles, the course of World War II is affected by the player. Failing to destroy particular targets will ensure that they remain problems in future missions, and doing extremely well will allow the allies to be more successful. Thus regardless of the actual course of the war, events unfold. For this reason it&apos;s possible to can end the war prematurely before Hiroshima was bombed or end up in a situation where American forces surrender to the Japanese.</plot>

It?s not like watching a football match (soccer American sports fans) where you?re constantly in danger of a cardiac arrest because your team need one goal to stay in the Premier League. Cricket is a different kettle of fish all together. Cricket matches don?t take hours, they take days. Cricket is all about sitting back and having a rest. As is the nature of cricket, you?ll either be batting or bowling. Batting is handled by the use of the directional keys and two fire button. Pressing various directions performs different shots.To be honest, there seems to be a lot of luck involved. However, if you know your cricket then you?ll love the attention to detail and will spend hours refining your bating skills.</plot>

  <plot>A spiritual descendant of War in Middle Earth, Spirit of Excalibur uses the same engine to tell the tale of what befell Camelot after the death of King Arthur. You play the role of the regent who holds the throne while chaos spreads through Britain. The game is broken into a number of episodes, which carry the overall plot of trying to restore Arthur&apos;s kingdom to some semblance of what it once was. Early episodes involve gathering the Knights of the Round Table, who have broken their fellowship. Because of their general distrust and dislike of certain other members, many knights will only return if asked by certain people and/or are given the correct incentive. Ultimately, you will wage a war on the sons of Mordred, who vie for the same throne their father did and stop the machinations of Morgan LeFayThe game is played on two different levels. The first is a real time map where groups move about from place to place. At any time (or when a group encounters another or a place of importance) you can switch to a &apos;scene&apos; level, which is a side-view of the group currently highlighted. Here you can pick up, drop, and manipulate quest items.</plot>

  <plot>Remember the days as a kid when you were fascinated with these big machines on the building site? With this game you have the opportunity to try them out! You can use either the excavator, bulldozer, steamroller or wrecking ball. The handling couldn&apos;t be easier, there are just three buttons to press: left, right and use.With each machine you get a simple task, e.g. carry three shovels of dirt on a truck. But the fun thing is that you aren&apos;t restricted to this and can just screw around. Why wreck an old house when the pit latrine is so much more tempting? The whole game is presented in full motion video - the reactions are very humorous and with a fair share of slapstick. To improve the long time motivation there are even multiple videos for every action, e.g. the first time you break a road block with the the excavator you drive on a highway, the second time into a canyon, the third time onto a rollercoaster and so on...</plot>

  <plot>The first in the Warlords series. Basically, your mission is world domination. This may be played between up to 8 people all on the same machine. It is a medieval type strategy game that requires the player to control 80 cities in the realm of Illuria. In order to do so you must wipe out your 7 opponents. Gold is accrued through the ownership of cities. The gold is then used to create armies. Heroes can sometimes &quot;find&quot; things or be rewarded by sages (there are only 2 and it&apos;s a first come first served basis). You can choose between various human and non-human peoples, as well as the ubiquitous evil Warlord. This is a very early version of what strategy games eventually became.</plot>

  <plot>New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone.Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside.Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons.They now have succeeded in endangering the country&apos;s economy.The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government.The C.I.A., headed up by &quot;The Boss&quot;, has to clean up the city of its crooks.One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions.The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success.The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn&apos;t match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops.On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars.This raid was an important stage in the whole operation.Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories.On May 15, they kidnapped &quot;The Boss&quot; in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime.This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful.Your mission is to liberate &quot;The Boss&quot; and to bring him back safely.You&apos;re gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where &quot;The Boss&quot; was last seen.You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.You&apos;ll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful.In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders.They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights.Once you reach the point where &quot;The Boss&quot; is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him back to a safe place.On the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect &quot;The Boss&quot; whose physical condition has been worn out.Wild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your gun and sometimes your panther will help you.</plot>

There are three types of move û short moves which also see you retain the square you were in, jumps in which you lose the previous square, and moves using the teleporting device to move a larger distance. There are over 100 levels, which needn&apos;t be played in sequence.

Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no free kicks. Whereas later sports games often carry heavy focus on the attention to detail, this game is rather simplified -- you can only control the player closest to the ball, for example, and it is missing many of the rules of soccer such as penalty flags and offsides.</plot>

In Scandinavia, you control a Viking on his boat. Here you need to collect treasure chests and avoid the whales crossing your way. In Russia, you play a Russian bear who needs to imitate the dance of a girl next to him. If he succeeds, the bystanders will give him money.

  <plot>The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the &quot;eight virtues&quot; and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you&apos;d help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the &quot;right thing to do&quot;. The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn&apos;t nailed down even if it didn&apos;t belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you&apos;d never finish the game.This VERY different approach to the game&apos;s ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final &quot;Holy Grail&quot; type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.</plot>

But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien spaceship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.</plot>

  <plot>The war of 1999 left the country of Kookistan in shambles. Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you&apos;ll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.</plot>

  <plot>The player controls a snake at the bottom of the screen, attempting to reach a goal at the top of the screen within a time limit. This snake can travel in one direction at a time, and must continue uninterrupted until it encounters an obstacle, at which point it has the option of changing its direction. Fortunately, the screen is randomly littered with scattered red blocks, and gameplay largely consists of plotting a continuous course along the contours of these blocks. Subsequent (infinite) levels (with a bonus challenge round every 10) incorporate differently-coloured blocks, which modify gameplay in various ways -- altering the time remaining positively or negatively, teleporting the snake to a random location, becoming a necessary checkpoint en route to the gate, or just terminating the snake. (Typically the snake will die only upon reaching the time limit or being trapped in an enclosed space by its own tail, which gets longer (unlike the goal, which gets shorter) and more in the way with every level successfully completed.)</plot>

  <plot>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor HybrysÆ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key û a very useful option in tricky situations.Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</plot>

  <plot>The black spaceman kidnapped your beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond your reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Your job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at your disposal.The range of explosion can be upgraded with time, but if you die, the range resets to minimum and you loose your previous skills, though. Some updates can make you walk through the walls, increase your speed, and give you some other assets to aid you in your quest to save the woman you love.This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final consisting of the boss you&apos;ll have to deal with. You can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind you thus evaporating the enemies, but beware, &apos;cos you can block yourself with your own bomb, and become a victim of your own tricks if you&apos;ll play in a huff.</plot>

Fluke has only 30 minutes to make it to the control room and avert a disaster.In Heavy Water Jogger, you, of course, play Fred Fluke himself, the man tasked with saving the town. Beginning at the entrance to the nuclear plant, you must make your way through the maze-like building to the control room at the center.Your task would be hard enough if you only had to navigate the maze, but on top of that, the plant&apos;s V7734 model security robots have gone haywire, and if they catch you, they&apos;ll zap you back to the beginning of the maze.Heavy Water Jogger is a game where you can&apos;t lose. Even if you run out of health or time, the game will simply pretend the whole thing never happened, and start over from the beginning. (For this reason, the game also doesn&apos;t allow you to save your game at any point.)

  <plot>The Earth&apos;s water supply tainted through generations of heavy industrial contamination, the remaining quantities of unspoiled drinking water were converted into stable water crystal form. Planetary defenses weakened in this time of environmental catastrophe, we mounted a valiant but ineffective defense against the water-crystal-seeking extraterrestrial Hydrites, led by their brutal general Overkill, in a conflict that reduced human civilisation to a few obscure overlooked outposts and turned our remaining ecosystem into a radioactive wasteland, rife with tunnels and ruins and a fecund breeding-ground for disease, mutants and abominations.Now it is the year 2060 AD. You are an HX-909 soldier in the HeXonium Force, the only known remaining human resistance group. From Zzexon&apos;s compound Zzexlia, perhaps the safest spot in a world where walking down the buckled asphalt remnants irradiates you, you mount exploratory expeditions into the great unknown in order to recover essential water crystals, harden yourself for combat, and arrive at a better understanding of what your planet has become. When the time is right, you will descend deep into the corrupted earth, past defunct air bases and toxic landfills, to take back the water and land that is your birthright and lay to rest the rumour that the notorious general Overkill still befouls Terran soil with his footprint.Though game output is restricted to text descriptions and coloured ASCII symbols on a map, the grim atmospheric tone of the writing compounded with the irrevocable strangeness (rats! I forget -- is my opponent&apos;s Salanger better or worse than my Natase?) of the world only a few decades in our future combine to give a player a sense of immersion and urgency. This latter is compounded by a reflex-based combat system, both long-range and melee targets lined up by successfully hitting the space bar at the correct moment of a count-down, the harder the target the faster the countdown -- a real problem with slow modem latency of the era, prompting the release of an ANSI terminal for the game, keeping the bulk of the data (and digitised sound!) on the client&apos;s end rather than the server&apos;s.</plot>

  <plot>Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player&apos;s rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player&apos;s control through agricultural development and town investment. There are two scenarios available in the game: 1. Warlords: 1560 A.D.The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition: 1582 A.D.The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. SamuraiThe game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). StrategyThe game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player&apos;s time table.The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of &quot;Body Points&quot; that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the pointÆs necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.CombatEach samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.Unit TypesThe game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 movement points; Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent&apos;s unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have 3 movement points. Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.Tactical CombatTactical combat occurs in two different locations:The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at least two squares away (not adjacent).The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner&apos;s force.</plot>

  <plot>This is the sequel to Kingdom: The Far Reaches. Many years ago, the wise Mobus broke a powerful amulet called &quot;The Hand&quot; in 5 pieces in order to protect it from getting into the hands of his evil brother Torlock. These pieces were sent to the far corners of the land. As the young Prince Lathan Kandor you have already retrieved the Black Mace, the Hunting Horn and the Orb of Mobus (in the previous game). Now you must retrieve the final 2 pieces (the Dagger of Arne and the Crown of Malric), defeat evil and be reunited with Princess Grace Delight.This is an adventure from the makers of Dragon&apos;s Lair. The plot isn&apos;t exactly original or complex, but the animation is fluid and well-drawn. Gameplay is about using the right item or making the correct choice between the animated sequences; some of these choices are timed, meaning that you can lose health or even die, but there are plenty of opportunities to replenish your health. Of special note is the ever-present Disney-like music.</plot>

  <plot>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being &quot;convinced&quot; to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times. Two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn&apos;t a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.</plot>

  <plot>The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available û this can only be done when no ball is active.Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be &apos;zapped&apos; using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally û simply pick up and place a generated fuse.Better still, you can steal your opponent&apos;s, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent&apos;s cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.</plot>

  <plot>Following the on-going war of the first Star Control game, the Alliance has lost. The Ur-Quan armada systematically hunts down the alliance races and imprisons them onto their homeworlds, including Earth. However unknown to the Ur-Quan, during the war, a small research vessel had been lost while sent to a distant star system looking for evidence of the ancient Precursor race. The survivors of this research team had come across the controls to a Starship factory and used it to build a Precursor supply vessel: one of the largest vessels in the galaxy. It&apos;s time for these Terrans to return to Earth...Star Control II is a game based on exploration, space combat, diplomacy and resource gathering. Your main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems. This uses fuel which must be processed in exchange for raw materials. In addition to providing fuel, raw materials can also be used to make purchases. You can use them to improve your starship, buy ships for your fleet, and hire crewmembers (who represent your ships&apos; &quot;health&quot;). Raw materials are found on surfaces of planets throughout the galaxy; you have to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up the materials you found earlier with your scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava which can damage or destroy your landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets. While in &quot;deep space&quot;, your starship can approach any star you come across, and then you can guide your ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons. Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available which shows the entire galaxy and allows you to set your ship on auto-pilot to any star. Throughout space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence. Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options, or in combat. Combat utilizes the same engine as the first Star Control game, where action is controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel is controlled uniquely and has unique abilities. Combat can also be played as a standalone game (&quot;melee mode&quot;), separate from the main storyline.</plot>

For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles.

The cars on offer range from police car and VW Beetle to school bus and truck, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses - trying to win with the bus, which involves blocking everyone behind the hideously slow vehicle for 3 laps, is perhaps the ultimate challenge.Initially there are 5 tracks available, with practice and single race modes as well as full championship at 3 levels - winning each of the first 2 levels unlocks an extra track. They all have hazards running through them, and sections where you must make a split-second choice between the safer route and the risky but potentially rewarding one. Multiplayer can be done via network or by split-screen - in a break with convention the screen is split vertically rather than horizontally.</plot>

Game supports an inventory, provides a few riddles and combat is realized through &quot;Hide and Shoot&quot; strategy - else you are no more.Scenery and video sequences are stronger part of overall feeling, they have that unnamed something to draw you in. The gameplay itself rely on your fast reflexes, riddles are obviously easy.

The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing your office.Training your fighters involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take 15-20 fights, just like real life. Choosing a beatable opponent, but one who can get your fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, negotiating the best financial deal, and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules, and a fight in one set of rules wonÆt be viewed quite as significantly by the other.The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the 2 expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judgesÆ decision would go).

  <plot>Jurassic War is an RTS set in prehistoric times that includes RPG elements. It is reminiscent of Warcraft, both in graphics and the units&apos; movement and control.At the beginning of the game you have to choose among several tribes. Each of them has got &quot;simple men&quot; (not just workers like in other games as they can evolve here), and then each tribe slightly differs with regard to most advanced kinds of units, such as &quot;magicians&quot; and the like.The RPG addition comes with experience: every time an unit of yours has killed something (be it an animal hunted for the only resource of the game, that is food, or be it an opponent unit) it earns this kind of experience you can see in the form of bars in the upper-right corner of the screen (when the unit is selected).Each unit has got these six bars showing its velocity, its light radius, its magic power, and so on. You can also choose to boost some of these bars only, that is they will fill up faster but at the cost of no progress for the other ones.Then the six bars are summed up in one only bar located at the top of each unit, and whose colour represents that unit overall strength.White is the highest level/colour units can reach. The most frequent white-barred animals you will encounter in the game are Tyrannousaurus-like dinosaurs. You need a lot of training with high-level monsters to have your units become that strong. Obviously also animals earn experience, and this happen only when you die fighting them, because they don&apos;t attack themselves.The goal of the game is the same of almost every other RTS - that is killing the opponent units and getting rid of their presence on the map.</plot>

  <plot>Simulating an industrial concern a bit more high-stakes than a lemonade stand, this game puts the player behind the accounting ledger of a company that builds bridges, which are large, complicated objects whose construction requires many resources and much labour. Coordinating supplies of both leaves a bit of money left over for research &amp; development, which may yield one-time dividends or permanently lower some costs -- if not necessarily paying for itself except on a long-term scale. Random events in the business world may find their way to the player&apos;s desk, arbitrarily benefiting or penalizing their company -- some ~25 events in the original TRS-80 BASIC listing, increased to over 65 in the MS-DOS BASICA version.All of this is a sideshow to the main business of winning contracts to build bridges. To even be considered for eligibility the player&apos;s company must have all necessary elements ready to go. Then there is a gentle art to a winning bid, striking some point on a Laffer curve not too high to be accepted but not too low to yield significant profits. Random factors are tempered with general rules, such as the documentation&apos;s suggestion to &quot;Make note that usually the more expensive bridges will mean bigger costs, hence you are capable of making larger bids, and therefore make larger profits.Once the player successfully amasses $500 million in profits, they are declared chairman of the board and the game concludes. Much more likely, however, is falling into bankruptcy, which ends the game a whole different way.</plot>

  <plot>In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3d movement, Toshinden&apos;s game play can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less depth to the moves.Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a lesser known version for DOS PC&apos;s. However the PC version is not a straight port of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing the same characters, attacks and controls.The U.S and E.U Playstation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in English and redone music using different instruments. The lyrics on Sofia&apos;s stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature. Sofia&apos;s and Ellis&apos; voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted, for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.The later Dos version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese Playstation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower quality than they were on Playstation.</plot>

  <plot>It is the year 2123. The genetically-programmed warriors of the Andromedan Hegemony are making the first moves to enforce their government&apos;s greatest desire: the takeover of the United Planets of Solaria&apos;s fantastically wealthy new mines in the Asteroid Belt. On Earth, capitol of the United Planets, military and political leaders are beginning frantic efforts to marshal human and material resources to fight off the alien onslaught.There is a knock at the front entrance to your dwelling. You open the door, only half-surprised to see that your visitor is a courier robot, painted in the distinctive blue-and-white uniform colors of the Solarian Armed Forces.

In a few hours you will be in the cockpit of a Katana single-seat interceptor, perhaps fighting for your life against the invading Andromedans...So the stage is set for Deep Space -- Operation Copernicus. As the pilot of a Katana war vessel, you will have your choice of four missions to test your skill and tactics flying--and fighting--amid the hurtling debris of the asteroid cluster known as the Trojan Group.

  <plot>Following the events of the previous game, N.E.O. the New Earth Organization, has gained some notoriety for defeating the forces of R.A.M., The Russo-American Mercantile. Because of this, the heroes of that mission are sent to diplomatic talks on Venus and N.E.O. stands to recruit a powerful new ally. However it isn&apos;t long before trouble starts, and an assassination attempt is planned against the Venusian minister. This is only the beginning of a plot embroiled with the mysterious Matrix Device, which can turn matter into energy. Naturally these adventures will take the NEO agents all over the solar system.Matrix Cubed is an RPG navigated in first person for most places but with an overhead view for combat and ship navigation. Players will create (or import) a party of up to six characters and assign statistics, abilities and equipment. Players move their party in a first person maze of corridors, open area and rooms. Certain encounters will allow the player to make choices based on the party skills. In the case of combat, the player and enemy forces each have a turn, controlled on an overhead map.</plot>

  <plot>It is half a year after the happenings in Bedlam where Major Kern defeated evil biomechs. Now they are back under the name Biomex and have important facilities under their control. Of course this has the consequence that the player uses Major Kern&apos;s combat robot to kill them all.Bedlam 2: Absolute Bedlam is an isometric shooter where the player basically explores big levels and shoots everything on his way. The controls are not too complicated: left mouse click to move and right click to fire. When enemies are killed they leave extras behind like ammo, shield energy or money. The money is used to buy upgrades for the combat robot between the 30 missions. The missions have varied tasks, e.g. conquering an enemy base, recovering a new engine or rescuing prisoners. Secondary missions are not mandatory to complete the mission but give useful rewards. Later in the game the player controls up to three robots. The missions are divided in four campaigns which increase in difficulty but can be freely chosen.</plot>

  <plot>SysOp Seth Able Robinson puts his money where his mouth is and cobbles together a BBS door game for his Amiga board after finding a dearth of other similar offerings for his platform. The framework is textbook RPG -- choose your class, fight monsters to loot money to upgrade equipment and earn experience points to advance in levels until you become sufficiently hardened through battle to vanquish the Red Dragon, scourge of the land. (Really, that&apos;s the whole story!) Input is handled through multiple choice selections; output is dished up as colourful text.The above minimalist formula doesn&apos;t yet describe the makings of a successful game until you factor in a few additional elements -- the unexpected complexity suggested by unpredictable random events manifesting just when you think you&apos;ve got the gameplay down pat on auto-pilot; the lackadaisical sense of rude &amp; lewd adolescent humour (whatever, dude) permeating the fantasy world, more Rabelais than Tolkien; and, of course, playing against your friends, not just to compete against their high score, but directly pitting your character in combat against theirs (played by the computer) -- then looting their corpse to add insult to injury and boost your bragging rights, broadcast in the daily bulletin to all active players!Individual SysOp customizations and an explosion of user-made IGMs (in-game modules) expand the play experience enormously from board to board, leaving the player with a vague notion of the framework of what they&apos;re going to get next... but keeping the specifics sufficiently jumbled with selections from a deep bag of tricks to keep them on their toes.</plot>

  <plot>Do you like to play darts? Would you like to have the opportunity to play darts on your computer? Here is your chance.This game offers seven scoring styles such as Golf, Cricket, and the normal 501 scoring style. Choose how you want to score the game and hop right in and play. Aim your dart with your joystick or keyboard, then let it fly and hope you hit something good!The game automatically scores for you so if you do not know how to score a dart game, you can still play. Knowing what you should aim for is helpful for getting high scores, however.The darts games included in this package are:1. 501This is the classic darts game where both players start with 501 points. Scores are reduced by the amount each player scores when it&apos;s their turn to throw. A leg ends when one player reduces their score to zero by hitting a double. A game is the best of three legs.Round the ClockThe player must hit each number in turn, starting at one and ending with the bullseye. A game is the best of three legs.FootballIn this timed game, the number of each segment plays no part on this game.Each player has a designated &apos;goal&apos; area. Players take it in turns to hit a sequence of beds progressing towards the opponents goal. The winner is the player who has scored the most goals when time is up.TennisThe player serving must hit doubles, the player receiving must hit trebles.A bed is highlighted on the board, this is the &apos;tennis ball&apos;. The server has two chances to hit their designated bed to &apos;serve&apos; the ball. If they are in successful the point goes to the receiver. If they are successful the receiver must hit their designated treble bed. This is repeated until a player fails to hit the ball. Scoring is as in tennis. A match consists of the best of three sets.GolfOnly the numbers one top eighteen are used in this game, representing the eighteen holes on the golf course.The object is to hit each number three times, hitting a double or a triple counts as two or three respectively, starting at one and working through to eighteen. The winner is the player to complete the game with the fewest dartsCricketIn this game the players represent the batting and the bowling sides at cricket.The &apos;bowler&apos; attempts bowl the batsmen out by hitting the inner or the bullseye, the inner takes out one batsman, the bull takes out two.Meanwhile the batting player attempts to score as highly as possible, but only points scored over forty count.The team with the most runs after two innings are the winners.SnookerAll numbers count in this game, numbers one to fifteen represent the fifteen red balls on the snooker table, while the remaining numbers represent the colors, sixteen being yellow and so on through to twenty being black.To score, or pot a ball, that ball has to be hit by the player in sequence. The red balls must be hit once and the colored balls four times (doubles and trebles count as two and three hits respectively.) Play follows snooker in that after a red ball is potted a color must be attempted, hitting a ball out of sequence ends a turn and forfeits points etc. The player with the highest score wins.</plot>

  <plot>Bruno Vasto, a madman, has stolen the experimental SF-2 stealth fighter and threatens to blow up Washington D.C.! It&apos;s up to you to infiltrate Vasto&apos;s organization and retrieve the fighter to save the world. It&apos;s all in a day&apos;s work for David Wolf: Secret Agent.David Wolf: Secret Agent was an experiment by Dynamix, not only as a self-published company, but also to merge digitized cinematic cutscenes with bitmap and 3D animation to create a better &quot;interactive movie&quot;. Four 3-D action simulations are the heart of the game: HangGliding (with a machine gun mounted to the front), Sportscar driving (with a machine gun mounted to the front), Fighter Simulation (with a machine gun and a missle launcher mounted to the front), and Skydiving (no machine gun). The player follows along with the story for a few minutes, then is attacked and must outwit his opponents to live.David Wolf serves as an interesting predecessor to the cinematic games Rise of the Dragon and Heart of China that Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye were trying to make.</plot>

  <plot>Fire Hawk: Thexder - The Second Contact is the sequel to Thexder. The Fire Hawk robot has the same main design as Thexder: a laser, shield and the ability to transform into a jet. It&apos;s also possible to use some special weapons which can be found during the missions, such as the Flasher, (damages anything on screen) and the Stopper (freezes enemies for a while).Levels are divided into sub-levels, with each fourth one featuring a boss fight.Some of the main improvements compared to the original game include the ability to save a game at certain points, the ability to switch between special weapons during gameplay, and a greatly expanded high-quality soundtrack.</plot>

  <plot>As its subtitle states, Firestorm is a forest fire simulation -- the first in a series of similar games by Cricket Software, in which you control ground and air based forces to fight forest fires in realtime.After starting the game, you see the map where the action takes place -- a top-down view of 180,000 acres of forested coastland somewhere in the Northwest, containing mountains and hills, roads and buildings, rivers and a lake. You now start with setting up the situation, placing up to five fires and initializing the wind direction. Both may be done randomly by the computer or manually by you.After pressing the GO button the real action begins: The fires start to slowly spread out, influenced by wind and terrain, and you have to control your four fire crews and two air tankers to prevent it. The fire crews can be used to cut fire-lines in the forests, preventing fire propagation, but you first have to move them near the fire, so be sure to let your ground crew use the roads. The two air tankers at your disposal can drop lines of fire retardants which will also stop the fire&apos;s progression. After dropping the retardants, the air units have to get back to their respective base for refueling, which takes some time. You can pause the simulation at any time to think about your next move. The game is highly configurable -- you can change the speed of fire crews, air units and of the fire, and you can select the air units&apos; refueling and their retardants&apos; drop time before starting the game. Wind parameters can be switched from manual to automatic anytime during the game. The game is entirely mouse-controlled.Firestorm turns out to be a simple, yet realistic and immersive simulation of fighting forest fires, requiring rapid decision and strategic skill.</plot>

Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they&apos;ll need to fight like animals... they&apos;ll need to fight like jackals...Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your gernades (upgradable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you&apos;ll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress.</plot>

  <plot>As Agent 006, you are the world&apos;s only hope: the terrorist organization known as the D.V.S. has captured the blueprints to a new, powerful weapon known as the &quot;Red Rock Rover&quot;. Your mission is to infiltrate an island occupied by the D.V.S. and retrieve the first part of the blueprints. Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform game, where your objective is to complete 15 levels, allowing you to gain access to the &quot;main fortress&quot; which is the 16th level. On each level, you have to find and destroy a radar dish, and also find a bundle of dynamite and place it at the exit to blow it open. On your way, you&apos;ll be threatened by human henchmen and robots, as well as various hazards, such as spikes, deadly laser beams (which have to be de-activated by finding a floppy disk and bringing it to a computer terminal) or pools of acid. The only weapon you have is a rifle which can be used to kill most opponents, though some are immune to bullets or require a little more than shooting blindly if you want to kill them! Agent 006 has three health points, and losing all three will kill him (though you have unlimited lives) - not to mention that some hazards kill instantly! You&apos;ll also have to make good use of pushable barrels which you can occasionally find: they&apos;ll be used as stepping-stones to reach higher ground, but make sure you don&apos;t drop them into a pit from which they cannot be retrieved. There&apos;s a variety of objects to collect - ammunition, bonus objects that give score (such as bags of money, briefcases, walkie-talkies etc.), and an opportunity to get a big score bonus: on each level, if you find three letters S, P, Y and collect them in the exactly right order, you&apos;ll get a lot of points - but it won&apos;t be easy! You can also find a few power-ups: boots that speed you up for a while, goggles that makes a few more platforms appear (thus giving you access to unreachable spots), an &quot;increased shot power&quot; item which allows you to fire faster, but also a question mark which reverses your movement for a moment (very confusing) or a &quot;1/2&quot; fraction which slows you down.</plot>

Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you&apos;ve gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot &apos;em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</plot>

  <plot>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</plot>

  <plot>In the year 2051, two mega corporations battle it out for supremacy over an overcrowded, overpolluted planet. CyberTech Industries, the dominant company on the planet, is being challenged by Axiom, who blames the former for their president&apos;s death. To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech&apos;s president, Anton Korsby, with a virus that threatens to take over his body, and ultimately destroy himself and CyberTech. Your mission is to enter Korsby&apos;s body, destroy the virus, and defeat the organism that controls his brain.Microcosm is a 3D action shooter, similar to Descent, that takes place entirely within the human body. The concept was inspired by the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage. The player pilots his way through various parts of the anatomy, blasting virii and enemy ships, while gaining power-ups and faster, stronger craft. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby&apos;s body.Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.</plot>

  <plot>Rebel Moon is a first-person shooter bundled exclusively with the Creative Labs 3D Blaster PCI or VLB 2D/3D accelerators. The game is only compatible with a video card utilizing the Rendition Verite 1000 Chipset.The game takes place in the middle of the twenty-first century as rebels of the Lunar Defense Force (LDF) prepare to wage a war of independence for the moon throughout twenty-some colonies settled there. For decades, the lunar colonists had felt oppressed as they began to hold less and less sway in trade policies and executive decisions carried out for them on the behalf of the Earth. Though their numbers and armaments small, the beleaguered lunar colonists had finally reached their breaking point, and declared themselves independent of the Earth.The United Nations, who had assumed total power over the lunar colonies, was furious and desperate at the development. The lunar colonies were absolutely necessary to feeding of the citizens of Earth, and due to this the United Nations could not possibly stand to accept anything but total victory over the Lunar Defense Force. However the LDF does not plan to lose: To them, they are fighting for their homeland and plan to defend it at all costs. That is where you come in...The game features many different styles of mission goals: objectives ranging from sabotage (where the player must find and destroy enemy infrastructure), seek-and-destroy (where the player and other LDF soldiers must eliminate an enemy stronghold), and even defense missions (where the player and an allotment of LDF soldiers must successfully defend a Rebel objective). Depending on the type of mission, the player will be allotted a specific number of LDF soldiers in reserve to back up the player&apos;s main force. Managing the numbers of those reserve soldiers could spell victory or disaster in some missions. The player has a large arsenal of futuristic weapons at his/her disposal, ranging from laser pistols to chain-fed rail-guns and plasma rifles.</plot>

  <plot>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot æem up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.</plot>

  <plot>Sierra&apos;s fourth Quest For Glory game is a journey into the land of Mordavia, a Transylvania-like setting. Our Hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our Hero. He&apos;ll discover his quest soon enough; that is, if he lives!Like the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and RPG. You can play as a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Once again you improve your skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve your throwing ability, which you might need to solve a puzzle). The combat system in this fourth installment is different: viewed from a platform perspective, it allows you to move freely, attack, defend, and even jump in real time, like in fighting games.</plot>

  <plot>This is a platform game with puzzle elements. You have to guide Jacek, the Electro Man, around the levels, using such things as teleporters, while shooting enemies and collecting weapon power-ups. This latter activity is essential - over a period of time, your weapon downgrades itself, until you can&apos;t actually fire at all.The game features in total 8 levels, on which there are three microchips that must be collected in order to proceed to the next. The difficulty level is very steep, and each death sets you back to your previously visited checkpoint, but fortunately already collected microchips stay collected. Checkpoints also serve as an additional difficulty factor, as once touched, they remove all your weapons, leaving you unarmed.Unlike many platformers, you can&apos;t control your jumping mid-air, and the main protagonist can only jump and fall at a given angle. This proves an extra challenge as when there are enemies above or below you, perfect timing is essential in order to succeed. The game suffers from almost no sound at all, and only the last level, which really is just a credit to the producers, has music.</plot>

  <plot>This is an unusual take on the football management game, which features virtually no statistics. Up to four managers can join in, to lead their chosen team through the World Cup, from qualifying to the actual tournament. Tactics and training are hugely important due to the game&apos;s short time frame.The players each have individual personalities, and these have been factored in during the game. Sometimes players will drink too much, fall in love, or have personality clashes with their team-mates or with you, all of which have to be factored in. The press will ask you loaded questions, so be careful how you answer.At half-time in each match you can single out a particular player for praise or criticism - if the team feels that you were unfair, their performance might fade. The World Cup is emulated accurately, other than having 2 points for a win instead of 3. The colourful match graphics and oil-painted stills are the same in style as those in the League Edition.</plot>

  <plot>Somewhere in London is a secret organization that is based on 13th floor of an office building. The sole purpose for this organizationÆs existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means keeping the current Prime Minister keeps ahead of his competition in the polls.Floor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister&apos;s polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or the even player&apos;s continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.During the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film &quot;Capricorn One&quot;). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.The Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting peopleÆs homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it&apos;s doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shadow President and CyberJudas, to allow for such an activity). However if players become too eager at performing these &quot;black hat&quot; activities, they may draw too much attention to the agency and may summon the attention of a certain &quot;Mr. Garcia&quot; (who is good at helping noisy Director Generals fly through office windows).</plot>

  <plot>War Diary is a real-time strategy game which uses the 16th century Korea as background. There two rival armies fight about the supremacy. The economic system is based on three resources - food, wood and metal - which are used to construct buildings or troops. These can also be purchased with money which can be earned by selling spare resources.The center of the base is the city hall which sets the radius where the eleven other buildings can be build. Important for the fighting aspect of the game are the barracks where soldiers are trained and the weapon factory where the soldiers are equipped. This means every soldier has to be sent to the weapon factory when he is trained as one of the three available jobs: Shooter, melee fighter or artillery. When equipping the soldiers there are different quality settings for the weapons which effects costs and effectivity. Weapons degrade and have to be replaced regularly. Troops can be distributed into different groups but the health and weapon durability has to checked for every soldier separately.Other units are watch towers, ships and monks. Monks are used to support the regular troops or to invoke ghosts. Troops and watch towers gain combat experience when fighting the enemy and as a result improve their abilities.</plot>

  <plot>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family&apos;s debt.4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It&apos;s up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player&apos;s flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.</plot>

However this game seriously complicates things with the inclusion of three different types of aircraft: jets, small craft, and super sonic jets. Players can also earn a salary.</plot>

  <plot>Counter Action is a real-time strategy released when, due to success of Command &amp; Conquer, many clones started to appear. What really differs this game from almost all RTS-titles of that time is its setting. Game actions take place in World War 2 on the East front. Player can take command over both Russian or German armies with separate campaigns and 14 missions for each side.Another feature of Counter Action is an absence of macromanagement, i.e. there&apos;s no building/resource gathering involved in the game. One will only need to control his forces on a battlefield. However, in terms of gameplay CA is still very close to Command &amp;amp; Conquer, with its famous &amp;quot;tank rush&amp;quot; tactic.</plot>

  <plot>The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - &quot;the biggest unanswered question is &apos;where is the money?&quot;The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.The game is a shoot &apos;em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</plot>

There is some sports management involved as the player you choose (from pre-built selection or from your own creation) can improve his skills (forehand, backhand, serve, volley, etc.) as he wins matches and prize money and moves up in the rankings. There&apos;s 4 different play options: Singles Match, Singles Tournament, Grand Slam, and ATP Tour. You must be qualified to play for the last two options based on your current ranking. Beating opponents ranked higher will move your own ranking higher more quickly.The playing view is directly from behind the player but as you approach the net it is scaled to always be appropriate for what the player would see from that vantage point. The players are viewed in large well-animated forms and even the backgrounds of crowd scenes are also animated. At the bottom of the screen there are player&apos;s photos and ability bar graphs as well as a small overhead view of the player&apos;s positions on the court.</plot>

  <plot>Based on a pen and paper game often called Squares, your objective in Dotso is to create squares by completing lines between dots.The game creates a random board of dots and lines for you to start with. On your turn, you can create a single line between two dots either vertically or horizontally. If you are able to complete a square with that line, then you get to place another line. Every time you create a square, you get to place another line. When you cannot create another square, your opponent takes a turn.In the beginning, you are mostly just placing lines here and there where you feel it is best. Once you can no longer place more lines without giving your opponent the opportunity to create a square, then the game gets challenging as you must find out how to let your opponent get as few squares as possible while getting as many squares as you can for yourself.</plot>

  <plot>An alien race watched the wars on Earth as television shows. After a period of peace threatens the ratings, two alien scientists go back in time on various continents of the planet and start to deploy modern weaponry on them. When they return to the present, Earth is engulfed in chaos. A British scientist discovers the conspiracy and using his new invention, the soul transfer machine, sends a boy called Billy to be incarnated on a native of the different time periods.Legends is an action-adventure with Zelda-inspired gameplay. The player controls a character pertinent to the time period (an American Indian from 1400 A.D. - America, a knight from medieval England, a Chinese warrior from Imperial China, an Egyptian acolyte from ancient Egypt, and Billy in the alien spaceship). These characters collect objects and coins to buy items, weapons to fight the enemies and hearts to increase the health bar (located on the top-left of the screen). Pressing 1, 2 and 3 switches between the available weapons. Other characters provide clues and level objectives. Each epoch has bosses to be defeated and mini-games (for example, on the Chinese level there&apos;s a race on the Great Wall). After solving each time period, the game displays a password that can be entered at the start on the main screen. There is no form of saving progress while playing the main game.</plot>

  <plot>Having previously recreated the more internationally famed rugby union with World Class Rugby, Audiogenic switched their attention to Rugby League, using the same game engine.The main differences in the league game is that a team has to give up possession after being tackled six times û which often leads to some bold moves on the 5th tackle, especially as if you retrieve the ball an opposition player, you get a fresh set of six tackles û and that after a tackle, play restarts by flicking the ball back to another player (inexplicably knows as the æPlay-the-BallÆ), while the entire teams (of 13 players, not the 15 in Union) remain on their side of the ball. Instead of line-outs, the ball going out of play at the side results in a scrum, as does a knock-on (fumbling attempts to control a pass or recieve a kick) if those are switched on.The gameplay is viewed from either a Kick Off-style overhead view or a forced-perspective 3D one, with a scanner on screen to show where your team-mates are (this is more important than in football). Passing is pulled off by pressing fire and directing the pass, whereas holding down fire will kick the ball up ahead. Tackling involves aiming at the player, and diving if necessary. Set-piece kicks involve aiming the direction and angle by pressing fire at the right times to stop a crosshair.</plot>

  <plot>Ancient Art of War is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength. The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast &quot;Barbarians&quot;, the heavily armored but slow &quot;Knights&quot;, and the ranged &quot;Archers&quot;. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: &quot;Spies&quot;, which is only available under certain campaign rule settings. The game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.Gameplay is represented in two major areas:1. The first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier;The second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player&apos;s real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).The difficulty setting is based on real-historical characters, (with the exception of possibly) Crazy Ivan as the easiest and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.Construction SetThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player&apos;s liking, such as default troop formations.EGA/VGA VersionBr°derbund released an EGA/VGA version of the game in 1989, using the same game engine and scenarios of the original CGA game. Campaigns made with the construction set of the CGA version were also playable with the EGA/VGA version.</plot>

The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection. The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases. You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them. Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed. The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition. Run out of a color and the game is over. The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.</plot>

  <plot>4-D Boxing leaves behind any pretences of being a pure arcade game based on boxing, and aims to recreate the sport in full detail. The graphics engine allows for multiple camera angles and viewpoints, and considerably detailed visuals. These required more advanced hardware than was common at the time, but a stick-figure mode was included as a compromise. The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them. You progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between. Advanced action replays are included as well, so you can review all that happened.</plot>

Between the two lie the Slave isles, a chain of islands under the oppressive thumb of the Saharans.You are a covert operative for the Atlantic Federation. Your mission is to conduct assassinations, enlist rebels and sabotage the Saharans operations in the slave isles. As you carry out these open-ended missions, the islands will rebel and aid your efforts when the Saharan invasion finally comes.Flames of freedom uses the same engine as Midwinter for land, air, and sea travel (and combat) but now, you control only a single customizable character. A strategic map allows you to identify key islands for your cause and determine the mission objectives that will sway it&apos;s population to your cause. Then, it&apos;s up to you to head in and carry out the mission as you see fit (perhaps guns first, perhaps with a big bag of money, perhaps just relying on your charm).Flames of Freedom mixes first person action with strategy, vehicle combat, and diplomacy for a unique gaming experience that carries on the Midwinter legacy.</plot>

Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you&apos;ve cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location.

  <plot>Your name is Oscar. You have to run and jump through 7 Levels in Hollywood-style (Science Fiction, Western, Horror, Cartoons, Dino, Detective and Gameshow) to find Oscars (yes û the Academy Award!). If you have enough Oscars you solve the level. You can choose the levels in every order you want. In the levels you must jump on platforms to discover the level. You kill the enemies by jumping on them. Some of them lose a power up like invulnerable or a superjump. You can also find a JoJo to break down walls or using as ladder. Two creatures are no opponents. First the white rabbit. He gives you a extra continue. Second a red elephant. Touch him for using as save point in level.</plot>

  <plot>Mankind have always tried to break through the borders of solar system, but due to wars, economic and ecological crisis this dream for a long time remained unrealised. In the third millennium the required technological breakthrough happened, which allowed humanity to make a step toward stars. Long after, widespread colonies, located on a distance of hundreds and thousands light years from the Earth, formed a new global alliance - League of the Intergalactic Nations, which guaranteed peaceful being, with all political and economical sovereignty for all members. But one nation, Quakers, wasn&apos;t interested in peace at all. Though Quakers attacking forces was destroyed after all, they still have many fortified bases at their mother planet. Pike - it is a military hovership, specially designed to efficiently fight on a surface of a waterworld. Game is a top-down arcade shoot-&apos;em(most of &apos;em)-up. Unlike many other arcade games, the map is actually rotating around you, with your ship remaining static. You can pilot Pike or helicopter called Hind, each has a different gameplay strategy. You can equip your craft with machine guns, flamethrowers, plasma guns and several types of missiles and torpedoes.In campaign mode game is separated onto days, and you must complete more than half of presented missions to move on to the next day. Usually, one day contains five basic missions and one secret. Objectives are simple - destroy/protect something and return to base. Besides global campaign, you can play random missions, duel mode or multiplayer via modem, null-modem or IPX network.</plot>

Yes, huge, secret terrorist organizations plotting crimes on a global scale. You know, the kind of totalitarian gang which is led by a mad, thoroughly evil genius from his giant underground base. Don&apos;t worry, the CIA is already searching for the plane. Yes, I&apos;m certain. If you would please excuse me now, my plane is about to depart. Oh, just to a beautiful, jungle-island banana republic. Holiday? I don&apos;t think so...The game is controlled by the same pop-up command menu consisting of six verbs that was introduced in Delphine&apos;s debut Future Wars. However, it&apos;s been slightly improved and does now allow interaction with your inventory, like examining and combining items. You get to toy around with a whole load of typical special agent&apos;s gadgets, beginning with a passport forgery kit and ending with explosive cigarettes. Apart from solving puzzles, you&apos;ve got to make it through some arcade sequences: escape the labyrinth, dive with limited breath, dodge the evil guy&apos;s minions.

DDT has sent a factory ship called the Toronto to harvest minerals and resources from Albion, a newly discovered desert world barren of life but rich in resources. Tom is sent to take some atmospheric readings on the planet, but crash lands after an apparently accidental systems failure of his shuttle. Upon reviving from the accident he is shocked to discover Albion is in fact a rich, life-filled world inhabited by many alien life-forms. It then becomes his task to explore the strange new world and locate the Toronto. His quest becomes even more urgent when it becomes apparent that the AI guiding Toronto is determined to destroy this life-filled world in the name of big business.There are actually two modes in the RPG, 2D and 3D. The 2D mode takes place in the overworld and inside buildings, and is a top-down perspective similar to Ultima 7. Navigation is through the mouse which you can use to move around, and click on things to interact with them. There&apos;s also a 3D mode for the villages and dungeons.Combat is turned-based and planned on a 2D 6x6 square grid, and the actual animation occurs in 3D.</plot>

  <plot>Wreckers is an isometric sci-fi action game with strategy elements.Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon 04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks û or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as BeaconÆs long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the ôWreckersö) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the stationÆs corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the stationÆs droid factory.Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the ôalien invasionö action archetype.</plot>

  <plot>One fine day P. J. Barrett, an ordinary human being from the planet Earth, goes to a repair shop to fix his TV set. When he comes back for it, he accidentally picks up a wrong one. No big deal? Quite on the contrary. When the unsuspecting Mr. Barrett returns home and turns the TV on, he is sucked into a portal! One moment later he finds himself on the strange planet of Daltere. Naturally, this planet needs a savior: the evil alien Helmar has stolen an artifact known as the Jewel of Light, thus endangering the entire galaxy. Now our unlikely hero has to overcome various obstacles and to save the world.Altered Destiny is a puzzle-solving adventure game. The interface is very similar to the one used in Les Manley games by the same company. The navigation can be done with the mouse (point-and-click), but the game still requires text input to issue commands to the hero and to interact with the world.</plot>

  <plot>Redneck Rampage is a pseudo-3D first person shooter much like Duke Nukem 3D, with 2D sprites for enemies and other objects. In fact, it uses the same Build engine as Duke Nukem 3D.Redneck Rampage also has a singularly unique setting... instead of taking place in an alien installation or secret government facility, the game is set in the backwater small town of Hickston, Arkansas. It seems that a bunch of tabloid leather-fetish cyborg aliens have abducted the town&apos;s stereotypical redneck inhabitants and cloned them. The aliens have also abducted Bessie, the prize pig of brothers Leonard and Bubba. As Leonard you&apos;ll have to fight the local yokel clones as well as the aliens throughout Hickston to rescue your pig. The &apos;Redneck&apos; theme is used very heavily. Levels range from trailer parks to chicken processing plants, and the arsenal of odd weapons include a gun that shoots circular saws, a TNT crossbow, and even a machine gun bra. Also, instead of armor and health kits, you restore health and become tougher by drinking whisky and eating pork rinds. But if you drink too much you go into &quot;drunk mode&quot; with blurred vision and stumbling movement.</plot>

  <plot>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</plot>

  <plot>This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, and so on.The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can&apos;t run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.</plot>

Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine&apos;s filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.</plot>

  <plot>Have you ever wondered what a day in the life of Bill Gates is like? Some cynical Finnish programmers decided to cobble together this little program to illustrate the big business decisions coming across Mr. Gates&apos; desk. Starting with a pile of cash, the player needs to decide how to allocate it, in one of three ways:1. First, he can hire bodyguards. These fellows won&apos;t help you make any money further on down the line (in truth, they are a continual drain on your accounts) but in the event of Redmond getting stormed by rabid anti-Microsoft fanatics, their bodies will keep yours from harm.Second, he can file a lawsuit -- most likely against an actual software innovator -- which is a bit of a crapshoot: money is allocated to the legal team and money comes out as a settlement, and if the player is lucky, the latter exceeds the former.Finally, if he&apos;s really desperate, he can develop and publish software. Choosing whether to make a minor (3.1 to 3.11) or major (2.0 to 3.0) update, he then assigns varying sums to the programming and marketing departments. Cross your fingers and see how it pans out in the marketplace!(Conspicuously, this game was never ported to Linux or released for Amigas or Macs 8)</plot>

  <plot>With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it&apos;s time to start a railroad! Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company&apos;s assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). The game is essentially a bird&apos;s-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.</plot>

The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world. In this &amp;quot;jump &amp; run&amp;quot; you can also get some power-ups.

  <plot>Tom Cruise&apos;s film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. You play Cruise&apos;s Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.From times to times you&apos;ll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</plot>

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid.

  <plot>Bargon Attack is one of the less known adventures from Coktel Vision, though it was one of the first that introduced the unique interface that was used in many Coktel games that followed. It was also one of the first of Coktel&apos;s games to use FMV technology in cut-scenes.The gameplay is a mix of science fiction, cyberpunk and comedy elements. It takes place in the near future when an alien race named Bargon conquered the Earth and enslaved its people. You take a role of the young programmer who decides to put an end to the cruel aliens. You&apos;ll travel through 20 or so locations. Each one consists of 1 to 3 screens, similar to other Coktel games.Along your travels, you&apos;ll face dangerous creatures and some strange alien technology. There are some occasions when you can die (though the option to replay the level is always available), plus the game also features several arcade sequences.</plot>

  <plot>1,000,000 square miles of open sea, your nuclear powered frigate and a fleet of Russian ships circling you. This is the set-up of Frigate a strategy battle game taking place near the end of the Cold War.Your mission is straight-forward. Destroy as many enemy ships as you can and try not to die. Points will be awarded for your evasive skills as your enemies are very well armed and for your hunting skills. Luckily your weapons are far stronger but there&apos;s strength in numbers. At your disposal are the following tools; radar, sonar, anti-missile weapons, radio jammers, and of course your ordnance.Your view screen shows two main windows with one devoted to our ship&apos;s status and one command menu where you give orders and receive notes about what is happening around you. Information is constantly being updated as to your ships defenses and weapons as well as the position of enemies and their missiles. The game-play is turn based and you can try and enter as many commands as you like in the given time period. As with many simulation games there are repercussions to damages you will receive from malfunctioning radars to weapon arrays. Graphics are largely non-existent and almost everything except for the title screen are text based so making your own written charts may aid you in successfully completing your mission.</plot>

Are you worthy of the title Star General?Star General can be best described as &quot;Panzer General in Space&quot;. Turn-by-turn, the ships in Star General move exactly like the ground units move in Panzer General. &quot;Spatial features&quot; like nebula, cosmic string, and such work exactly like &quot;terrain&quot; on earth. Even the combat mechanics are nearly identical, where ships are rated in missile and beam values, like the ground units are rated in hard vs. soft assault values. It has several novel features though. Inclusion of a full AI capable of playing to death instead of relying on turn-limits is a first. Having the ground units land on planets after the space war concluded and fight a separate ground battle. Research is minimal (only 4 generic levels) and ships cannot be customized.

  <plot>International Moto X simulates off-road motorcycle races. The main part of the game is the championship mode in which the player controls a 125cc motorcycle. There are various different leagues on different continents.At first the player creates his rider and sets the colour of his bike. More important is the tuning of the bike. It is possible to buy new dampers, tires or engines or update the ones already in use. Also there is a choice between three, four or five gears - inexperienced players can select automatic.During the race the goal is obviously to be the fastest rider by using all the tricks in the book - including stunts like wheelies, risky jumps, sliding or forcing the competition out of the way. There are several shortcuts to use but when the player is caught doing so, he is penalized. Winning a race results in prize money which can be reinvested in better gear. After winning all races in a league the player is allowed to ride in the 500cc league.Because the game is played in a 3rd person perspective there is no cockpit view - so all relevant data is shown in the upper left corner of the screen, including a mini map. Additionally there are two training modes, a time race and a training race against seven other riders on a course of choice. The game also features a scenery editor to create own courses but it not possible to save unfinished work. The competition editor allows the creation of new leagues with old or new courses.</plot>

The player is a lone gunman battling CaponeÆs men down the streets and alleys of the city. The game plays much like Operation Wolf. As the game progresses, the screen scrolls sideways and evil gangsters pop up from behind windows and buildings. The player must take care not to hit innocent bystanders, including women, children, and pets strolling down the street. There are also two indoor scenes, including a warehouse filled with TNT and the finale that takes place inside a bank. Capone was released in the early years of the Amiga, and had a very unique look for its time.Although the major selling point of Capone was it was the first light-gun game available for the Amiga, players could also play entirely with a mouse. During mouse play, a cross-hair cursor appears on screen. Firing is accomplished simply by hitting the mouse button, or trigger on the light-gun.</plot>

  <plot>This remake of Skool Daze replaces the limited 8-bit graphics and sounds from the original with new enhanced assets while maintaining the same classic gameplay from 1985. Besides the overall graphical improvements, this version adds small touches like random weather and other special effects. The player assumes the role of Eric, a school student in a desperate quest to erase a disastrous report file from the director&apos;s computer. The teachers and other fellow students are shown moving about on a scrolling side-view of the building, where the player has to guide the main character to the classes and make him attend and perform other chores from the daily routine. The protagonist can interact with the environment and cause mischief, write messages on the available blackboards, punch the other kids making them fall flat on their backs, and shoot pebbles at distracted teachers with a slingshot.Eric must hit the shields decorating the many rooms of the building to retrieve the password for the headmaster&apos;s computer, where the report file is stored. After being caught doing any transgression, he receives a random number of lines as punishment, with 10000 as the maximum allowed before being expelled from the school. Most of the children are anonymous characters milling around the location, but some have names and personalities that can hinder progress. Angelface is the local bully that sometimes contracts mumps, infecting Eric if he crosses path with him and causing the end of the game, as the sick boy is sent home by one of the teachers. Einstein is a snitch, telling the teachers about any misbehavior he witnessed.</plot>

  <plot>The Lords of Midnight brings to life this epic land, as Doomdark&apos;s forces aim to wrest control of its 4000 screens. Your initial party of the task contains four fighters - Luxor the Moonprince, Morkin (his son), Corleth the Fey and Rothron the Wise, each of whom has their own characteristics. Many more lords can be recruited as the game progresses, with names such as Lord Dreams, Lord Blood and the Utarg of Utarg. If Luxor is killed, only Morkin remains under human control.The game can be won in two ways - by overthrowing the full might of Doomdark&apos;s forces, or by stealing the moon ring back from its location (a task only Morkin can attempt), meaning that the game can be played as a straight strategy title or an RPG of sorts.The land of Midnight includes lakes, keeps, plains and forests (the Fey are usually located here). You can always look in each of the 8 compass directions, meaning that the game features 32000 views - a remarkable tally in systems of this size.Doomdark&apos;s forces, the Foul, move at night, giving the game a turn-based structure, although your characters can also die at the hands of dragons, skulkrin and wolves.</plot>

  <plot>In Zombi you control a team of four intrepid travelers, who have landed their helicopter on the roof of a shopping centre in the hope of finding fuel. The problem is that, with Hell full, Zombies are walking the earth, devouring humans as they please.Zombi is a point and click adventure game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though.</plot>

After a narrow escape from the helicopter bringing him there as it inexplicably crashes, Robert and his droid Joey must search the decaying city, attempting to befriend both the snobby rich and the frustrated poor as the two attempt to get out of the city, but in the middle of everything they uncover the dark truth about LINC, the bizarre computer which makes the city tick.Using the then revolutionary Virtual Theatre engine, BASS&apos; characters can move freely independent of the player, allowing the game world to be much more dynamic than anything seen before (other than Virtual Theatre&apos;s debut game, the less popular Lure of the Temptress).

Once again, you&apos;re a mage whose quest is to destroy the evil Nemesis. Just like in the previous installments, you can throw fireballs at your foes or use them to destroy certain walls. You can find bolts and nukes which allow more powerful attacks, healing potions, scrolls and keys. You can also find gems which allow you to see approaching enemies on your radar.

You must win a total of 9 matches to prove yourself, with two sub-games to negotiate (Revenge of the Beloms and Faulton Feeding - fortunately these can be practiced from the main menu) as well.The basic game sees you and your opponent start with a row of six Beloms (small round creatures) which must be kicked across the pitch quickly enough to leave your opponent with all 12 at his end. When this happens you can run to his end to win. The main things to avoid during the match are being hit by a shot and kicking one into the crowd. When hit you lose time recovering, and are penalised with a Pelvan, which can cost you up to 3 Beloms, by hitting the crowd.After every third match you must play the Faulton Feeding game, which involves aiming at six progressively-higher poles to hit the Faulton creature with the food - fail to get enough of these and you must replay the previous match. After other games you play the Revenge of the Beloms game, in which Beloms hurtle towards you and must be deflected away with your pole - failure to clear enough before one hits you reduces your score from the previous match.</plot>

Gameplay is almost identical to the original Jagged Alliance, featuring overhead-view turn based combat taking place over an area map. The main difference between the two products is the addition of new mission types, new weapons, multiplayer (over an IPX network), as well as scenario and campaign editors. Players begin by hiring up to six mercenaries from a roster of many and equip them with necessary weapons and items. They are then assigned to a mission with particular and unique objectives. The missions are ordered but they are not geographically linked as in The original Jagged Alliance or it&apos;s sequel, Jagged Alliance 2.</plot>

Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don&apos;t get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.Ofcourse, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent&apos;s goal, but that&apos;s where the resemblance ends for me.</plot>

With green symbols, you tune your four weapon types - but you can&apos;t switch them yourself - they change when you pick up a corresponding symbol. Other symbols give you extras like homing rockets or small satellites which circle around your ship and protect you against damage. With a second fire button you can use smart bombs to clear the whole screen.Each of the six big levels consists of three stages: A 3D, a vertical and a horizontal shooter stage. The programmers didn&apos;t skimp on the graphical effects: There is always something that explodes or presents something similar to the eye. Between the levels are rendered 3D cutscenes and bonus games which nod at classic games like Pac Man or Galaga.</plot>

If you know Hogan only from his movies, you&apos;ll have a different reason for crying. One of the films featuring Hulk was called Suburban Commando (1991). Alternative Software turned it into a game two years later, and decided to create a wild mix of space shooter, platform jumping and - of course - beat-em-up action.Loosely following the storyline of the film, Hogan alias intergalactic hero Shep Ramsey travels through space, crash-lands on earth and beats up the bad guys. The first level is a R-Type-like horizontal space shooter; destroy formations of drones and collect weapon upgrades. After that, you&apos;ll enter three platform levels, in which you have to find nine items each. Avoid being shot and dispatch the enemies with kicks and jumps. After each mission, youÆll encounter the level boss, who youÆre supposed to beat up in a Street Fighter clone.Apart from a comic-style likeness of Hulk Hogan as the main hero (with a huge head and tiny body -- strange), the game has little reference to the movie. No other main characters appear. Fans of the film will especially mourn the complete absence of any mimics.

The player starts out with the ability to create Basal Golems, around which the game revolves since they generate your sole source of power: mana. By spending mana they can be transformed into stronger fighter units or, less frequently, into buildings.

  <plot>Based on the board game with the same name this game places you as a nation in the Mediterranean to rise and become the supreme ruler. Spanning about 8000 years, it covers the development of ancient civilizations from the start of agriculture to the emergence of Rome as the dominant power. Although military strategies are possible it&apos;s far from any wargame as the main goal is to gain an overall advancement involving cultural, economic, political and religious powers. The battles which emerge are normally the result of shortage of land rather than attempts to eliminate other nations. The player who effectively balances each aspect of the game will build the strongest civilization and win the game. In contrast to most other board games the results of combat and other calculations don&apos;t involve chance - the only exception are event cards which may involve calamities like earthquakes or revolts.</plot>

The tanks on the player&apos;s side that aren&apos;t controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on.To top things off, there is also a limited amount of resources allocated to the player and can be gained by destroying enemies; these resources can then be used to buy new tanks before the start of the next mission..</plot>

As a mature game, the protagonist is also able to hand strippers a dollars to have them remove their top.The character, voiced by Jon St. John, also regularly delivers commentary on the events through one liners. There are 28 levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, nightvision, protective boots, a hologram known as the holoduke, and a jet pack to reach higher areas.

You are used to orders of hunting down the Resistance, a ragtag band of rebels committing sabotage and other acts of terrorism against the WEC, but slowly, you realized the WEC is not quite what it appears to be... then one day you and two other Silencers, your best buddies, were ambushed by a WEC mech patrol when it was supposed to be a routine mission. You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance... Crusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You&apos;re up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don&apos;t). You&apos;ll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there&apos;s usually a bit of puzzle involved. It&apos;s often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that&apos;ll let you access another part or another level of the map. Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too). The missions range from simple sabotage to rescue.</plot>

  <plot>The dominators are the most powerful but also most ruthless force in the universe and are determined to destroy all living beings in the universe. To put a stop to their doing, you choose between three different ships and then fly out into space.The game plays like a normal horizontal shooter. While the screen moves slowly from left to right, wave after wave of enemies enter the screen from all sides and attack the player&apos;s ship. As the player shoots his way through these hordes of fighters, bombers and other types of ships, he earns points and picks up power-ups. While the power-ups are instantly activated and give him benefits like a temporary fire power boost, the points are used between the missions to upgrade the ship a little in terms of new weapons or more health.</plot>

  <plot>FlipOut! is a puzzle game starring aliens from the planet Phrohmaj. Your objective in each puzzle is simple: you must place all the colored tiles into the correct spaces on the board. The tricky part is that there is always one more tile than there are spaces. That means you are always juggling at least one tile in the air. The game becomes more difficult as you have to juggle more tiles, and the Phrohmajians try to interfere.This game features nine bizarre areas, each with multiple puzzles. The graphics feature a lot of crazy animation of the Phrohmaj onlookers and lots of bright and colorful tiles.</plot>

While it featured a succession of levels based around sections of the movie, these were highly varied and presented in polygon 3D graphics. These can be played in any order in the Arcade mode, or in planned sequence in the Movie Adventure mode, which follows the film&apos;s plot of Japanese investors wishing to replace Robocop with their Robot Ninja designs, and thus expecting him to prove himself as superior.The first task is a car chase resembling Chase HQ, in which a mazey section of road must be followed efficiently. There are several first-person 3D shooing sections,. in which you must use a target to shoot down punks and invaders, without harming civilians. Robocop also takes to the skies in a simulation of his new Gyropack flying device. Also, he must do battle with his intended replacement in a fixed-perspective beat &apos;em up section.</plot>

  <plot>Sid &amp; Al&apos;s Incredible Toons is a spin-off of The Incredible Machine series. It features cartoon characters and items instead of pseudo-realistic contraptions, but the goal is the same: to build hilarious machines reminiscent of the pictures of Rube Goldberg.Sid Mouse and Al E. Cat have probably never heard of Tom &amp; Jerry, but theyÆre just as single-minded: any means to hurt the adversary is a good one. They get plenty of means in Incredible Toons. Around 100 puzzles need to be solved, each one a 2D machine of which crucial parts are missing. The player&apos;s task is to choose useful objects from a separate window, position them on the screen and start the machine to see if itÆs working. A simple example: a piano hanging from a rope needs to be dropped on Al. To accomplish this, you place open scissors next to the cable and drop a ball on them - voila, the rope is cut, Al crushed. However, most puzzles are far more complicated; for example, the player might first have to lure Al under the piano with a fish, which needs to be transported to the right location by conveyor belts.The puzzles involve a score of contraptions, ranging from simple ropes and pulleys to balloons, trapdoors, catapults, bombs, electrical hairdryers, and motors. Sid and Al are accompanied by several other cartoon characters, such as the lady elephant Eunice who will toss things around, or the pet dragon Bik that ignites objects with his fiery breath. Gameplay is spiced up with cartoon animations -- Al chasing Sid is a sight to remember. If the player has solved all of the puzzles, the player can build own challenges with the comfortable editor. Oh, be sure to learn Sid &amp; AlÆs lessons well -- you never know when you need to get rid of a mouse with nothing but some cheese, a trapdoor and an anvil.</plot>

The 32 levels through which you&apos;ve got to guide the ball are full of traps: laser barriers, ramps, tubes, breakable tiles etc. Colored keys will open doors, switches create (or destroy!) helpful items. These include picks to repair floor tiles, parachutes to prevent you from falling off and bombs to destroy walls. Items have to be bought with coins that are found all over the level. The inertia of the ball has a very realistic feel to it, making the control intuitive and relatively easy.

  <plot>Based on the board game of the same name, 221 B Baker St. pits up to four players against each other in a race to solve mysteries set in Victorian London. After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries and read its case file in the game&apos;s manual. The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.Solving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together. Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis. Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful. Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge. Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith. Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz. If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.</plot>

  <plot>The Princess Blue was a trading vessel. While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. As the only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue, you swear revenge... but it&apos;s a big and expensive universe. In order to upgrade and repair the ship, you&apos;ll need credits. Which could be obtained through trading or hunting down pirates or maybe a special mission or two. There&apos;s also the matter of finding those who are responsible for the death of the Princess Blue. Following their trail will require obtaining information from several different characters.Space Rogue is a space simulation, a predecessor to Origin&apos;s better known Wing Commander series and specifically, Wing Commander: Privateer. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Interstellar travel, between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple &apos;tunnel&apos; game where you must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at your ship, so the faster you can get through them, the more armor your ship retains. Finally, when docked on most locations, the game shows your pilot from a top-view and you can walk to different shops/bars/characters.</plot>

  <plot>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world&apos;s most powerful and prestigious over the course of your 8 years in office. Sounds easy, doesn&apos;t it? It would be if the other guy didn&apos;t have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up 3rd world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction.The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc. This game is very challenging, and will keep you up for hours. Be sure to try playing against a human too... it adds a whole new dimension.</plot>

The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account. The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one æprofessional foulÆ (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.</plot>

  <plot>Real-time strategy game with a difference: you fight for control of the sectors, some of which contains manufactories which can gain you additional units. Touch the &quot;flag&quot; in the sector and it&apos;s yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments and armor and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent&apos;s base... And prevent him from doing the same to you...Z differs from other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a bit army. You have finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast you&apos;ll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle. It&apos;s these little touches that makes Z an underappreciated title, as you don&apos;t really need to micromanage each soldier.</plot>

  <plot>This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie.The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.ScroogeÆs office is your headquarters. Here you have three options û you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. ItÆs these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. ThereÆs also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on whoÆs winning between you and Glomgold.You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill à Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.The jungle features ScroogesÆ nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamusÆ backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.Photography, with Webbigail, ScroogeÆs niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.</plot>

  <plot>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.The game&apos;s plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball... sorry, bolt... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</plot>

  <plot>Love for Sail! is the sixth game in Al Lowe&apos;s Leisure Suit Larry series. Larry unexpectedly receives a ticket to a cruise ship. Upon the arrival of the passengers, a mega-contest is announced. This contest includes various kinds of sports and activities, from bowling to love-making. The winner will get to &quot;score&quot; with the sexy Captain Thigh. Naturally, there is no way Larry can win this contest fairly, so he must use his brains to solve the tricky puzzles of the game, and to cheat his way into the Captain&apos;s bed.The game features a context-sensitive interface: clicking on an object brings forth a series of verbs which the player can choose in order to interact with the given object. In addition to that, it is possible to try and type any other verb (provided the game understands it), just like in old adventure games with text interface. Sometimes it is necessary to think outside of the box and to come up with unusual actions in order to solve a puzzle.A lot of new features have been added to this version that make the player into an &quot;active&quot; part of the game. Using a microphone, players can add their own voice, while using a scanner lets players insert their own photos. Another feature that grabs attention is the automatic wallpaper. When Larry &quot;scores&quot; with a woman, that woman&apos;s image can be displayed as wallpaper on the Windows 95 desktop.</plot>

  <plot>An early 4X space strategy game that foreshadowed the more recent Master of Orion I and II. The game can be played with 2-6 players, any combination of which can be either human or AI controlled. There is no real sound in Armada 2525, save for the occasional system beep. Game play can be either open ended or set to a specified number turns. There is no set objective to gameplay (except for your 4X&apos;s) and the story line is almost non-existant: It is the year 2525 and as your race begins its first step in extra-planetary colonization, you discover that you are not alone in the galaxy. You must compete with up to 5 other races in colonizing planets, and the near lack of diplomatic interaction in the game pretty much insures that you will need to build defenses early on. Unlike Master of Orion, diplomacy only occurs when an opponent requests peace, but you cannot make such requests yourself. Armada 2525 offers a fair assortment of ships (approx. 20) and buildings (approx. 15), which can only be built after the appropriate technological advance. One can build research labs which are dedicated to one of eight available scientific fields: weapons, construction, hyperspace, force fields, biotech, planetology, info science, and psycho science. Combat can be controlled to an extent - though you cannot affect the individual actions of ships, you can issue general orders and arrange them into formations.Your race will start at a predetermined homeworld from which it will expand to colonize new solar systems in the usual 4X quest of exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating of your opponents.</plot>

  <plot>Black Monday is a stock market simulation for one to six players. The goal is to earn as much money as possible by the end of ten turns. On each turn you will have the option of buying and selling stocks. The main screen where you can buy or sell will show a list of stocks available, along with their price information and how many you own. Graphs are also available to show the history of a stock throughout the game in order to aid in making decisions. After each player has a turn buying and selling, the stock market closes for the night. When it opens again, you will see a news ticker summarizing the changes to stock prices and the players will again have an opportunity to buy or sell (this process repeats until the end of the game when the winner is determined). Although the price changes to stocks are random, you can attempt to influence the price somewhat by buying or selling large quantities of a stock. If a stock is doing very well, you may earn dividends or the stock may split. If you get into trouble, you can also visit the bank and take out a loan.</plot>

  <plot>Knights of Xentar is a sequel to Dragon Knight II, and is the only Dragon Knight game that was released outside of Japan.You control a young warrior named Desmond (Takeru in the Japanese version). After liberating Strawberry Fields from an evil curse in his previous adventure, Desmond finds himself in a situation unworthy of his heroic status: robbers have taken all his possessions, including his magic sword, and even his clothes! So the first task for the unsuccessful hero will be to get some money. Luckily, the mayor has an assignment for you, for which he is also willing to pay. Desmond accepts the assignment without knowing what it will lead to - traveling all over the world, fighting fearsome enemies, encounter beautiful women, and solving a mystery that will also reveal the secret of his own true identity!Knights of Xentar is a humorous RPG with erotic content. The RPG system is completely different from that of the previous game. You travel now in top-down view on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, like in most traditional Japanese RPGs. The enemy encounters are random. While the Turbo CD version retains the first-person view for battles, in the PC port they are top-down, Final Fantasy-style. Also in the PC version, your party and the enemies attack each other automatically. You can pause the battle at any time to cast a spell, use an item, or change your attack style. You have an attack gauge with 8 different attack levels. At higher levels you can execute more powerful attacks, but your speed decreases.Knights of Xentar features animΘ-style cut scenes, many of which contain erotic images - the girls Desmond encounters and helps will often feel grateful and award him with some &quot;treatment&quot;. In addition to the regular version of the game, the PC port also introduces an X-Rated version with more explicit nudity.</plot>

  <plot>Most of the conventions that became standard for tennis simulations appear in this early title - indeed many were pioneered by it. Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level - winning at one level automatically moves you onto the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, with a player requiring a 2-game lead to win a set, although a tie-break comes in at 6-6 in all but the final set.The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball to give a more realistic appearance and make it easier to judge its height. Spectators turn their heads to view the action, and ball-boys run on to the court to retrieve a dead ball. Shot speed, direction and spin can all be applied, and forehand and backhand strokes are both available.</plot>

When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham&apos;s health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte. King&apos;s Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female as a lead character. As Rosella, you will meet characters that will either help or hinder you. You move Rosella around with arrow keys, and perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King&apos;s Quest games, which used the AGI engine, KQ IV uses the new SCI engine; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while you&apos;re typing, giving you time to give even the longest commands.</plot>

Although Spanish, the game has almost no text, only four words: &quot;Opera Soft&quot;, the name of the company; &quot;Ulises&quot;, the spanish name of the character, and the word &quot;Fin&quot; at the end (spanish for &quot;The End&quot;). The Ulysses character moves from left to right throwing hammers to kill an incessant wave of enemies. The game doesn&apos;t have levels, but sections within one expansive level. Precise jumps are required to clear abysses and gorges, and to avoid collision with dangerous objects. The SPACE bar makes the character throw the hammer forward. O and P move Ulysses left or right, respectively. Q is the jump/move up button, and A is the crouch/move down button. The game starts with three lives, and each rescued damsel adds an extra one.

Gameplay is well-known: You play Jumpman, having to rescue your girlfriend from the clutches of love-sick giant ape Kong, by running, jumping an climbing to get to the top of the skyscraper. You can pick up your girlfriend&apos;s lost items for bonus points and grab a hammer to smash barrels and fireballs thrown at you by Kong.The &quot;Champ&quot; mode is an upgraded version of the classic game, featuring different levels and more bonuses.Finally, the game features a variety of options -- one or two player modes, three difficulty settings, adjustable game speed, input by keyboard, mouse or joystick (Champ even released a &quot;Champ cable&quot; that allowed you to play the game with digital joysticks), and a high score table to round it all off.</plot>

  <plot>In Robin Hood you must perform many heroic deeds to change the public impression of you from &quot;villain&quot; to &quot;hero. To he ultimate aim is to retake your castle, which is captured in the intro sequence. This involves bringing together your band of merry men, and killing the Sheriff and his guards. There are around 6 extra items you can find in the game, most of which aren&apos;t essential but make the game a lot easier. The whole interface is similar to Populous: you don&apos;t direct Robin directly but with icons which are placed around the screen.The AI citizens of Sherwood go about their lives as normal, so it&apos;s another game that you can spend just watching and wandering through rather than trying to complete.</plot>

  <plot>Arnie 2 is an isometric action game. Although it&apos;s obvious to which Hollywood actor the game&apos;s name alludes, Arnie 2 is not a licensed title and not based on any movie.It is the sequel to the Amiga / C64 platform game Arnie (1992). Unlike the previous title it has been developed in-house by ZeppelinFast reflexes and a lust for violence are required for success here. Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.</plot>

  <plot>Pebbele Beach and St. Andrews are two of the courses on offer in this golf simulation, released in the early years of 16-bit technology. The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn&apos;t choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren&apos;t a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Begginer/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring. A uniquie feature for the day was the course designer, which was quite versatile with practice.</plot>

Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.A third consideration is the &quot;Virtual Operating System&quot; controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software&apos;s efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</plot>

  <plot>In the 16th century, Japan&apos;s Sengoku (&quot;Warring States&quot;) period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei&apos;s better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp;amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender&apos;s region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</plot>

  <plot>Evets is a relatively rare roguelike game that has several unusual features like controlling a party of characters instead of a solo character, and group of monsters instead of single monsters. Apart of this and the slightly unusual menu-based user interface, the game is a quite typical traditional.The game starts at the main menu, where you&apos;ll first have to assemble a party. You can create character by choosing a race (six races available), a class (one of four classes, but there are four more classes in the game) and an alignment (D&amp;D like, plus an &quot;Amoral&quot; alignment) and then distributing some points on some class-determined stats. Each character is already quite well equipped, so you can immediately start exploring the dungeons, but you can also spend some money buying better stuff.The dungeons appear in usual roguelike manner -- top-down view in ASCII graphics. You move through rooms and corridors, occasionally meeting groups of monsters which results in a turn-based combat.During combat, you have the possibilities to fight, cast a spell, use an item, parry or run. You may stumble upon several groups of monsters at once, like 4 skeletons and 2 gromes, in which case you&apos;ll have to choose whom to attack first, which gives the combat a tactical touch. When you won a fight, you get experience and gold.The dungeons also feature some special locations like traps, shops and a review board, the latter revealing another specialty of Evets, which is switching character classes during the game.Despite its unusual and promising features, the game has a quite cumbersome and non-standard interface which makes it difficult to handle. For example, spells you want to cast have to be entered by full name, which is somewhat cumbersome as some spell&apos;s name have been abbreviated (&quot;Magic missle&quot;), but at least, the last entered spell is the default.</plot>

  <plot>Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies. The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills. The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases. Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death. A high score table is also included.An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.Base Raid - Akin to &quot;capture the flag&quot;. Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.The CD-ROM manual includes a &quot;Cyberpunk story&quot;, to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.</plot>

And who&apos;s the suspect? Norman Bates, of course. The next night, a daring detective drives out to the sinister Bates Motel. His plan: a) find the jewels, b) free the curator and c) take a nice hot shower, should time suffice.Psycho is entirely controlled with the keyboard: direction keys for moving your character around, shortcut keys for performing actions. You need to stand close to an interesting object in order to examine it. Adversaries will appear at random throughout the house, putting you to sleep by touch and thus draining your precious time -- you&apos;ve only got four hours to solve the case. You may shoot the enemies as soon as you find a weapon. As there is no other option for character interaction, this is how you&apos;ll deal with the Bates family as well.</plot>

  <plot>A good example of the difference a little multimedia can do, the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes plays like a textmode proof-of-concept of the better-known Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. The basic investigative elements remain the same: managing time dashing to various locations around Olde London Towne in search of clues, but here instead of successfully receiving them as video clips you often get cryptic encoded messages in &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; form, intended in total to spell out, some directly and some through phonetic wordplay, the name of the killer, the method they used, and their motive for committing the crime. Characters from the original tales including Dr. Watson, Mrs. Baker and Inspector Lestrade help to establish the flavour of literary canon as you investigate all-new crimes (some user-contributed!)</plot>

  <plot>SimHealth is one of the more interesting and novel ideas to become a game in the famed &quot;Sim&quot; series. It may be stretching it a bit to call it a game, given the detailed level of the simulation and its serious subject matter: the debate in the summer of 1994 over what kind of health care system the United States should have. The player gets the usual godlike power, being able to choose what proposals to adopt and even what assumptions should be in the underlying mathematical models (an especially good thing, since many of the models turned out to be so very wrong).</plot>

  <plot>In this sequel to the original Doom, you play the same hero - the last remaining space marine. After having single-handedly saved Mars from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already invaded it, killed all its inhabitants or turned them into demons. It&apos;s your task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth.Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for keys. Unlike in Doom, which is divided into three episodes, the 30 levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels) form one long episode. You have the same weapons as in the first Doom, plus a new one: a super shotgun. There are also some new demons in this sequel, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal Revenants who launch homing missiles and the Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack. There is also one new power-up, a Megasphere which boosts your health and armor to the max.</plot>

After verifying its content, there was no room for doubt: a spaceship of our defense forces of the future had problems, but it had problems in our time. How was that possible?The ship has been infiltrated by foreign forces and was going to crash in the Arctic zone, which was under enemy control. The question arose immediately -- Could they seize our technology of the future...? It can&apos;t be allowed!Our best man must go into the enemy base to reach the rest of the ship and take off. Objective: to obtain our technology of the future. The mission doesn&apos;t seem easy. For that reason, it has been entrusted to Derdhal, who had already been victorious in dangerous missions in Army Moves and Navy Moves (with the same gaming style), demonstrating a deep knowledge of all the guerrilla techniques and expertise in handling computer networks. The U-92 submarine leads you to the enemy base. When you are above the frozen surface of the Arctic, there will be no return. Your first mission will start. Good Luck! You cannot fail.</plot>

There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot&apos;s power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can&apos;t make slight stance adjustments easily.</plot>

  <plot>An old, but very realistic space shuttle simulator. The package contains, in addition to two game disks, a very thick manual and a large sheet (A2 size, maybe) displaying the cockpit instruments of the shuttle. To successfully fly the missions, the player must learn a great number of dials and how to use every single instrument, located in nine different cockpit panels. The controls can be used with mouse, but keyboard shortcuts are essential for quick operation. In addition to cockpit views, there are various external views, from which you can see the shuttle e.g. in launch pad and in orbit. If you do not use time advance or time skip options during the game, playing one mission can last for days. Going through the proper pre-launch countdown takes five hours, for example.</plot>

You can return to your mother ship and trade your scavenged fuel for additional supplies. (Your mother-ship docking tractor beam can also be used to capture earthly aircraft... hmmm...)The controls are akin to (but different from) a helicopter&apos;s. You can control the amount of anti-gravity; you can pitch, roll, and yaw; you can thrust back and forth, up and down, and side to side. (Thrusting up and down is preferable to the less precise use of antigravity - important while docking.)For advanced flying, it is possible to use anti-laminar transducers to completely eliminate drag (important to keep your hull from overheating), and use the aforementioned gluon devices to &quot;fly&quot; forwards (But watch out for spinout!)There are other options available, including landing pods, illuminator beams, probes, gravitons, shields, teleportation.

  <plot>In StixWorld, you control a stick-figure character created by a little girl in her notebook. It turns out she had gotten into a fight with her brother after he made all sorts of scribbles and monsters in her notebook (your world). The kids&apos; parents had sent them both to their rooms and thrown the notebook into the recycle bin. Your mission is to save the notebook from the recycling truck. Your only hope is to find the guru you heard about who can teach you how to escape the notebook into the real world. Unfortunately, you must deal with all of the brother&apos;s scribbles and monsters along the way.StixWorld is a 2D side-scrolling platform game using a 2D geometry engine rather than sprites. The artwork is in the style of a child&apos;s stick-figure drawings in a notebook, down to the notebook-paper style background. The story, art-style, and underlying 2D geometry engine allow all the objects to be animated, rotated, and scaled.So for example, in one level, you ride a hot-air balloon to the moon and are able to walk all the way around the moon, ending up upside-down at the bottom, where a sign says &quot;Earth&quot; with an arrow pointing down -- you jump and rotate while falling until you land back on the Earth. In another level, you jump from car to car along a train, trying to get to the engine, and you see mountains in the distance. Once you reach the engine you find that you can jump from the smoke clouds to the tops of the mountains, and the world scales as you jump -- it was just a small toy train after all.</plot>

While power in Britain has been restored after the death of King Arthur and the destruction of evil sorceress Morgan Le Fay a terrible force has been unleashed. The demonic Shadowmaster, a dark summoning of the slain witch, is terrorizing Britain entrapping the King and stealing the fair court enchantress, Nineve. You must command the knights of the kingdom to find and destroy the vile beast. The gameplay takes place in seven acts or episodes and features a mix of RPG, adventure, and simple strategy game (for combat) elements.

When all the bricks for a level have been cleared, the player will advance to a next level.The racket can fire rockets at any time by using a &apos;Gigablitz&apos; weapon. To activate it, hold down the &apos;Alt&apos;-key and wait for an indicator to reach the top. The trick is, in order to use Gigablitz, no balls must hit the racket, or the Gigablitz sequence will be aborted.When some bricks are hit, they release gadgets that can be collected. Many of them enable more balls on screen, enlarge balls or let you advance to the next level. Beware though, do not collect red-coloured gadgets as they can shrink your racket, invert racket movement or substract points.Finally Tronic also has a built-in level editor that lets you create, play and save your own Tronic levels.</plot>

  <plot>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd&apos;s classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six &apos;Wedges&apos; you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select &apos;yes&apos; or &apos;no&apos; to tell it whether you got it right.The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</plot>

  <plot>In Clif Danger players control the titular protagonist who flies through the galaxy with his spaceship when he receives a call for help by the amazon queen Swihip. Her planet Pleasure 6 got invaded from the rather hostile Glox so it is up to him to save her population. The game focuses on the typical run, gun, jump mechanics and as such the plot is not that important. The game offers twenty stages with multiple weapons, where Clif encounters a dozen different enemies and free the amazons from their rather inconvenient position of being bound on plugs.</plot>

  <plot>The ultimate goal in Empire! is to build a great galactic empire protected by a huge frontier shield. Before this can be achieved however, players have to complete various missions, trade with starbases and fight off invading aliens.The ship is controlled from a top-down perspective, with four gauges indicating its energy level, temperature, radiation level and shield status. When the radiation level or temperature reach maximum, the ship is destroyed. The ship heats up when it&apos;s near a sun or firing weapons. The radiation level rises when radioactive pods are carried. When the ship is running out of fuel, it can be refueled by collecting ore from planets. Two direction finders at the bottom of the screen point towards the next starbase, mission objective or manually chosen target.At starbases, players can accept missions and trade minerals, ore or people. These three goods can be found on planets (in form of pods). In order to land on a planet, players must enter a warp hole. Once on the planet&apos;s surface, the game switches to first-person perspective and the player has to dodge or destroy rockets fired at the ship and follow the direction finders towards pods or the &quot;exit&quot;. Starbases need to be supplied with materials to be able to produce &quot;performance pods&quot; and equipment for the ship.In order to reach other star systems, players have to fly through asteroid belts. Although some systems can only be reached with a special hyperspace pod.Many star systems are overrun by aliens and can only be reclaimed when all aliens are wiped out. There are also systems that are infected with the plaque and players must take care not to spread it to other systems. As the game progresses, more aliens, better equipment and new starbases appear. When all systems have been visited, players can buy starbases. When all systems are owned by the player, the game can be finished by constructing the frontier shield.</plot>

There are three game modes: training, single race and championship. The first two will be useful to practice in any of the 30 circuits, while the last one is where the serious stuff begins.In the championship mode you will first have to choose difficulty (easy, normal or hard) and the circuit where you want to start (as in real life, each circuit will be also divided in ten parts). Finally, you will have to choose your car, which will be either a Toyota Celica or a Lancia Delta HF Integrale, whom depending on your economical gains after the races, will be upgradeable.</plot>

  <plot>It is the unimaginably distant year 2009. You are Nick Vrenna, falsely locked inside a high security prison. The genetic experiments conducted in the prison, combined with a full-scale riot that took place recently, caused all guards and inmates to be transformed into insane, aggressive mutants. Your job is to escape while stopping the genetic plague from transforming the whole world. Abuse is a side-scrolling platformer with a lot of shooting. It&apos;s a nonlinear game, as the levels often have a few exits that lead to different areas. Your character is a cyborg equipped with various weapons; initially, you only have a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers. You move through a building complex, fighting any enemies you might encounter on the way. The enemies are mostly the mutants, but also the defense systems (such as stationary missile launchers). While you move with the keyboard, you can aim with your mouse, so you can shoot at any angle no matter what direction you are running. On your way, you&apos;ll find elevators, teleporters, cracked walls that can be destroyed and more. Apart from ammo and health, you can also find upgrades which have a number of beneficial effect - increasing your running speed, for example.</plot>

Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley&apos;s lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It&apos;s an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping.

All the modes play pretty much the same except you get different units in all the modes. To win you have to destroy your opposing King/General/Control Tower.Each unit has a health and power bar. When you move or use a special attack the power goes down then the King/General/Control Tower must come to re-power them. This puts your main piece in danger.

Little did they know that the club was entering an unprecedented run of success that has continued well into the 2000s.The basic control system will be familiar to anyone whoÆs played a Kick Off game, as it involves holding fire to trap the ball under your playerÆs foot, and releasing fire to pass, although the ball will be kicked onwards if it is moving fast when it comes to you. Other gameplay features include diving headers, variable pitch conditions, penalty shoot-outs and accurate deflections. 2500 players featured in the game all had a range of varied ability statistics, as well as different skin tones.As well as individual matches and custom-created tournaments (which have much the same range of features as Sensible Soccer, plus full calculation of injury and suspension severities, including disciplinary points and differing injury lengths), you can play out a full season of matches for any club in EnglandÆs top 5 divisions û all domestic league and cup matches are included, with promotions and relegations taking place after each season.

  <plot>F1 Manager Professional is the successor of F1 Manager, keeps its main structure and offers subtle changes in the game mechanics. It is still a managerial game which simulates a racing team in the Formula One.One part of the team success lies in the financial side. Money is gained by getting companies to sponsor the team and by getting good results in the races. The budget limits the quality of the driver and the other employees. Besides the driver the most important part of the athletic success comes from the used car. Like in the real world it needs to be constantly evolved and tuned. If the player doesn&apos;t want to do this part himself he can hire engineers which take this job on. This part of the game is played in several menus in a 1st person view which are reached by a main menu.The actual race is shown in real time and 3D and can be watched with several camera angles. There the player can see if his preparations and pit stop strategies were useful. The preparations are optimisations referring to the course and the expected weather, e.g. using the right tires or fuel. Pit stop strategies can be changed during the race. During the multiplayer mode the time which every player has to his disposal can be chosen freely. The game has no official licenses so all names are alienated but can be changed with the editor. Registered owners of the predecessor can buy an upgrade version for less money.</plot>

  <plot>Flight Unlimited is a civilian flight simulator. You can choose between an Extra 300s, a Bellanca Decathlon, a Sukhoi SU-31, a Pitts S-2B and a Grob S-103. Take part in aerobatic competitions or, if you&apos;re a beginner, learn how to fly in 34 lessons. Flight Unlimited stresses reality: All ground textures and elevations are based on real satellite photodata, and the flight model has a heavy basis in real world physics. The manual is quite detailed, and combined with the in-flight tutorials, the user is provided with a very gradual introduction to flying.A very comprehensive piece of work, and a defining title for Looking Glass, whose only competition at the time was Microsoft Flight Simulator (which look immediately dated compared side by side to Flight Unlimited).</plot>

  <plot>If you&apos;re bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</plot>

  <plot>Pit historic and legendary baseball teams from 1901 to 1989 against each other with accurate team members and stats in Budget Baseball. This top down sports simulation plays more like a strategy game with a dash of RPG thrown in for chance rolls. After the initial selection of team members simple ASCII graphics are used to represent where they are on the field. Typical placement of hitters and pitchers are also done before a game starts. As opposed to controlling what your player does with graphic instructions you select from a menu how your batter will react to pitches. You can bunt, try to hit a single and even try for a home run hit. While this happens you can try and force your runners to steal if they can and all successful moves and failures are determined with a chance roll by the AI. After your turn at the bat is finished it&apos;s your turn to play batter again as the opponents or pass the controls over to a friend via shared keyboard and let them have a go.The shareware version of the game comes with nine pre-loaded teams including; 1989 San Fransisco Giants, 1988 Oakland A&apos;s, 1975 Cincinatti Reds, 1954 Cleveland Indians, &amp;amp; the infamous 1927 New York Yankees. More teams of the registered players&apos; choice could be purchased upon registration.</plot>

In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin&apos; hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee&apos;Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee&apos;Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</plot>

Worst of all your magic users won&apos;t help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard&apos;s Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air.

  <plot>May 15 1984. In a bar, shortly after a shady deal took place two men enter the bar. They are undercover cops, and once the criminal notices them, he flees the bar, and as his motorcycle skims past town, the pick-up truck used by the undercover cops isn&apos;t capable of keeping up when the criminal goes past a fence into an open field. However, while escaping, he left something very important behind.Three days later, someone breaks one of the agents&apos; house. Inside, John and Jackie Ryan are brutally assassinated by an unknown hitman. Their son Jake witnesses everything hidden from the closet in his parent&apos;s room.11 years pass by, and Jake Ryan, living with his grandmother since the incident, joins the Academy and graduates with flying colours. His parents&apos; death turned into a cold case, despite the best attempts by Lyle Jamison, one of John&apos;s closest friends and P.I. to bring the criminals into justice. As he is assigned to the local Jackson Beach PD, he learns that stolen National Guard weapons are suspected to be circulating in the area, and one night something catches Jake&apos;s eye that might bring him closer to the truth...Designed by former Police Quest mastermind Jim Walls, Blue Force is an adventure game mostly similar to Walls&apos; previous games with Sierra, where real police procedures are blended into the gameplay. Visually it is also inspired by late SCI engine games, with carefully crafted backgrounds overlayed with video-captured sprites as characters. Interface, however, is different, as the player has the complete inventory on the bottom side of the screen and actions (walk, look talk and use) can be reached using the right button.</plot>

  <plot>Space is a dangerous place. For that reason, the Alliance of Space-Faring Alien Races (ASFAR) was formed to prevent interstellar war from breaking out. The ASFAR provides robotic Perimeter Defense Computers (PDCs) to watch over the star systems of each member race and prevent any single race from mobilizing weaponry. For 70 years, this has been successful, until suddenly, in the year 2704 A.D., PDCs direct armadas from all other systems to attack Earth. While bloody, the planet ultimately survives and rebuilds its military forces. The TV-202 is constructed, an advanced fighter craft that is equally agile in space and atmosphere. The TV-202 will be sent to various ASFAR planets in order to destroy their military compounds and prevent them from rebuilding attack fleets.Terminal Velocity is a first-person flight simulator sometimes compared to Descent due to its free-roaming nature. Players take control of the TV-202, a fighter notable for its ability to fly in 720 degrees of direction, ignoring gravity and providing constant thrust. While flying to different planets, the TV-202 is able to speed up and slow down, but will never come to a complete halt. The majority of the game takes place in the air (and sometimes space), flying above landscapes which include trees, mountains, rivers, snow and other terrain. Additionally, tunnels can be found, often hidden, dug into the sides of landscape. Upon entering these tunnels, the TV-202 loses its ability to turn around (going ahead constantly) and must navigate avoiding enemies, moving walls, rotating obstacles and other hazards. Power-ups are found by destroying enemy forces or destroying enemy bunkers which are scattered around each level.The TV-202 has an energy shield which is depleted by enemy fire and running into terrain, when the shield is gone, the player is destroyed. Shield Power-ups and Energy Core power-ups can be found to restore shield energy. For weaponry, the player begins with a single Plasma Assault Cannon (PAC) weapon that fires straight ahead. Other weapon power-ups can be found which include a PAC power-up, an Ion-burst gun (ION), Rapid Targeting Laser (RTL), Manual Aimed Missile (MAM), Seek and Destroy Missile (SAD), Shock wave Torpedoes (SWT) and Discrete Annihilation Missiles (DAM). With the exception of the Annihilation Missiles, all these weapons also fire directly in front of the player. There is an afterburner fuel power-up which will allow the TV-202 to increase its thrust substantially, traveling much faster than normal.Each world features its own unique enemies and hazards. The different levels of the game provide unique objectives which can include flying to checkpoints, destroying specific targets (including bosses) and entering tunnels. Upon completing the necessary objectives, the player is directed to exit the level via a Departure Unit (DUN) located somewhere on the map.</plot>

  <plot>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who&apos;s the boss.Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers&apos; own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.Turrican can get some different weapons for his arm cannon:1. The bounce weapon which rebounds from surfaces into smaller bouncing balls when powered up;The laser, which can shoots beams as large as Turrican himself when maxed out; the multiple shot beam, which can shoot up to five beams covering approximately a 90 degree angle. The Turrican suit weaponry is not limited to the arm cannon however:1. He also can fire a continuous beam, activated by holding the fire button. This beam can be rotated around Turrican, so it is possible to blast things below him in this way;Additionally, he can fire power lines by pressing the space bar, resulting in two energy bars as high as the screen going from the Turrican suit to the left and right of the screen, severely damaging enemies in the process;If the space bar is pressed when the hero is crouching, the Turrican will morph into a shuriken shape. In this state, it will roll to the left or the right, damaging enemies while being invincible and small bombs can be dropped by pressing the fire button;Finally, the most powerful attack, which can only be used one time per life, can be delivered by pressing the fire button and the space bar at the same time. The Turrican suit will morph into a shuriken shape and fly around the screen for several seconds, while firing shots of the different weapons in multiple directions.</plot>

The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence. Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</plot>

Enemy robots are thrown onto the grid by a drone emitter. The robot drones are initially not too difficult to deal with as the only danger is in colliding with them. But as increasing numbers of drones start bouncing around the playing area it becomes increasingly difficult to keep your ship safe.You are aided in your attempts by the ships invaluable quad directional auto cannon. The game play is unique in that moving and firing is independently controlled by four keys each. This takes some getting used to, but results in intense action once mastered.The concept is simple.

And that&apos;s your job, help Kwirk reaching the exit.The game offers two different game modes, &quot;Going Up&quot; and &quot;Heading Out&quot;, the difference is how the exit and the game field looks like. In &quot;Going Up&quot; you heading for stairs which lead to the next level. In &quot;Heading Out&quot;, you just head for an open tunnel which will lead to the next level.Going Up&quot; offers three different difficulties, which will effect the complexity of the level, not only the size, but also the amount of puzzle elements. In each difficulty you can play 10 different levels. &quot;Heading Out&quot; has only one difficulty, easy, but has 31 levels in a row.You do not need to solve a level in order to get to the next, all 61 levels are accessible directly from the main menu.In the levels itself, you need to move around wooden crates in many different sizes and forms, some are only in the way to the exit (and you must get around), but some others are needed to cross water. In addition there are gearwheels in the level, from two-arms to full four-arms. You need them to rotate in order to get somewhere, or to make room for a crate to move. Furthermore, there are sometimes solid obstacles in the level, where you can end up with a crate in a dead end...If you fail the level and can&apos;t reach the exit, you can easily restart it, and play it so long how you want.On a few levels, you aren&apos;t alone, there are sometimes multiple Kwirks, all under your control, positioned at different places in the level. In this case one Kwirk needs another to complete the level, but all Kwirks must reach the exit, if not, you&apos;ve failed the level.</plot>

Connect via the GEnie network or fly head-2-head against a friend at modem speeds as low as 1200 baud. If you played via GEnie network, the battles could contain up to 50 people from all over America at the same time.Each plane has unique features in regards to performance, maneuverability, and flight control characteristics. Using the keyboard control help-screen (brought up with the F10 key) during flight helps reduce the learning curve. Chat communication in real-time air battles is limited to keyboard text, which makes quick abbreviated responses a necessity.

This game featured an updated database, but the most significant new features were:1. The multipolar level, where small countries could go to war with their neighbors on their own. Of course, you could help them out (or encourage them!) by sending in military aid.18 more countries, bringing the total to 80.A &quot;Crisis Advisory Board&quot; of four people, who would give you advice during international crises.

  <plot>In Fisher-Price: Firehouse Rescue, the player controls a fireman driving a firetruck. Both the fireman and the firetruck bear the familiar style of the popular Fisher-Price toy line. The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck&apos;s ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.While the first level confines the entire neighborhood to a one-screen maze, later levels span multiple screens, thereby increasing the challenge. Further, later levels also add time limits and additional keys that the player must collect before attempting the rescue mission.</plot>

  <plot>Baron von Bansai has stolen Terry&apos;s precious collection of crystals, and dropped them onto 32 different kingdoms, so Terry sets off to retrieve them. Viewed from above, his challenge sees him having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no &apos;lives&apos; as such, but there&apos;s a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement&apos;s effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well.To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you&apos;ve already done).Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself (other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which contain crystals, and so on.</plot>

Unlike earlier first-person RPGs like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder, the player can move in every direction and the graphics are updated continually. The dungeon also is not made entirely of corridors and rooms arranged in a rectangular fashion but has a lot of variety: slopes, stairs, bridges and more.Underworld&apos;s combat system is action-oriented. The player has to draw his weapon and aim at his opponent in real time. The magic system is based on runes that can be found in the Abyss. If combined in the right order, they produce a magical effect. As the Abyss is populated by more than just monsters, there are also various dialogue sequences with NPCs, who one can also barter with.</plot>

  <plot>International Athletics is an arcade track &amp; field game by the Spanish developer True Emotions. It was initially published by Opera Soft in Spain in 1992 under the title Olympic Games &apos;92, then licensed by Zeppelin in 1993 for their &quot;International&quot; series of sports simulations.International Athletics consists of eight events, grouped in three basic categories:1. Running - 100m, 110m hurdles2. Jumping - Long Jump, High Jump, Triple Jump3. Throwing - Javelin, Shot Putt, DiscusRather than the traditional rhythmic key tapping or joystick rattling of the Decathlon offspring, International Athletics requires only timing, with most events mastered with only two key presses. To run the 100 meters for instance, you hit the action key once to get your athlete started, then adjust his target speed on a slider. Once that&apos;s done, you lean back and watch him race to the finishing line. Events such as triple jump and 110m hurdles require several accurately times keystrokes in order to succeed. In general, mastering the events and even setting new world records is a matter of only one or two repeats.Practice mode lets you exercise your timing, competition mode plays through all eight events in set order. If you fail to meet the qualification requirement on one event, you are out instantly. Up to four players can compete on one PC in split-screen mode. The game&apos;s presentation is thin, with digitized photos of the eight events as the main eye-candy and a complete lack of atmospheric stadium sequences, ceremonies or national anthems; in this respect, International Athletics doesn&apos;t even meet the standards set by Summer Games and Epyx&apos; other late-80s sports classics.Options include three difficulty levels, changing wind and different weather conditions, which are not visually represented but affect the achievable event result. Likely one of the most esoteric options seen in a track &amp; field game so far is the possibility to activate doping. This doesn&apos;t mean that players can actively dope their athletes, but they may fail random doping checks after each event, which results in immediate disqualification - essentially a form of Russian Roulette.</plot>

  <plot>The sun is about to go supernova and humanity must find a new home. All the population is packed into a huge fleet of ships and they set off for a suitable planet. Unfortunately the route goes straight through the territory of a hostile alien race, the Rexxons. The game is a space shooter but you also get surface missions on different planets. The main emphasis on the game is the graphics which were excellent when the game was released but this meant that the game was very short with just 7 levels. There are loads of cutscenes all with music from Holst&apos;s planet suite.</plot>

  <plot>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-&apos;em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</plot>

  <plot>The 3rd installment in the Tony La Russa Baseball series. This sports an array of new features and improvements for both arcade-action fans and baseball strategists and statisticians. The response time of all input device options has been optimized to improve the reactions of the on-screen ballplayers. From pitching and hitting to running and fielding, gamers will now enjoy quicker, more responsive interaction when playing the game. With the new pitcher/batter matchups, specific confrontations between each pitcher and batter can now be simulated even more accurately, with an expanded database of stats reflecting each pitcher&apos;s and batter&apos;s tendencies versus any opponent they&apos;ve faced during their careers. In addition to providing detailed play-by-play and color commentary for each game in the &quot;action (arcade) mode&quot; as they did in Tony La Russa Baseball 3, the game&apos;s veteran announcers, Mel Allen, Lon Simmons, and Hank Greenwald, supply more realism than ever by referring to each player by name when pitching, batting, fielding and baserunning. Two &quot;universes&quot; of data-final 1995 season stats and 1996 Spring Training rosters-are available when simulating a single game, an entire season, or multiple future seasons in the &quot;General Manager Challenge&quot; mode. New stat categories have been added, which help define each hitter&apos;s performance in specific situations, such as: runners in scoring position; pinch-hitting appearances; and other critical circumstances such as close games in the late innings. Clutch performers like Wade Boggs, Mike Piazza, Barry Bonds, and Don Mattingly are now portrayed more faithfully than ever before.</plot>

  <plot>Constructor gives the player the chance to run a construction company in a place where real estate is up for those who want to develop it first and where everything is allowed to get rid of the competition.Starting in a single plot of land with the headquarters, a construction team (composed by a foreman and one to five workers) and a repairman, the player must start by building a wood mill and provide housing to the bottom of the social ladder: slobs. From there, taking advantage of their fast reproduction rate, the player can train new workers, and as soon as three different wooden huts are available, the council will allow the construction of a cement yard, which in turn allow the construction of better buildings. However, slobs wouldn&apos;t appreciate living in such luxury, and so a gadget factory can be built so that computers are distributed to their houses, allowing for a new generation of better educated citizens. While the workers pack a nasty punch when in a large group, violence should be left to the professionals. After building a Pizza Parlor, the player is allowed to use the services of gangsters. These are able to take on that pesky foreman or that building the Council asked to get rid off.But there&apos;s more to the game than build from ghetto houses to luxury buildings, and as they say, all is fair in war, and construction IS war. The player can send his foremen to capture other teams&apos; buildings, or do even worse: provide housing for the scum of society. From hippies to ghosts, these can do a number on the other teams&apos; properties. Want to stress out a tenant? Send the thugs to do a wild party in their house. Need some cash or materials? Send the thief to relieve a team from them. All this while avoiding the others do the same on you by assigning police patrol to key areas. As time passes, it pays out to build other, more friendly, buildings. A school allows everyone to breed more civilized members of the society, the hospital allows recovery of wounds much faster or the park, where everyone goes to relax a little, among others. Improving the rooms and giving them garden furniture is also a good way of keeping tenants happy, but jealously can grow among neighbors. Failing to comply to tenants requests and demands will quickly turn the Council against the player.The player will have to balance the output of their tenants to achieve success: overdoing one of the elements will take a dent on the bank account (leading to bankruptcy), cut the arrival of new workers (putting a strain of existing teams), replacement for deceased tenants (leaving houses vacant that eventually decay into a flaming pile of rubble not before giant cockroaches settle in) or police and mob favors (to patrol areas against undesirables and gangster actions). The difficulty level affect what maps can be selected, but also which actions the undesirables can perform. To choose higher difficulty settings, more computer players (up to three) must be activated.</plot>

In a nutshell you have to pick up speed in order to beat the track before your time runs out; you also have to destroy various obstacles in your way and collect weapon upgrades.This game was never made into a title by Bullfrog and was released as a freeware game -- see trivia.</plot>

With this money you buy airplanes, which differ in statistics like range, price or room. On a world map you define routes, ticket prices and load (passengers or commodities) and send them on the flight. The rest is handled by the game itself and the only thing you have to do is buying new planes, sell parts of your stock due to financial difficulties, watch your balance sheet and handle a few random events like strikes or oil crises.

  <plot>Jonny Quest is an action-adventure game with beat-em-up sequences.This game is based on the Hanna-Barbera animation series The Adventures of Jonny Quest of 1964. Jonny is bright young fellow with a talent for judo-fighting, defeating evil creatures and generally doing heroic things normally not suited for 14-year-old boys. When mayan idols disappear in the South American rain forest, the Team Quest sets out to comb through the jungle and a couple of temples.Gameplay is divided into two parts: On the top-down map of the forest and the temples, Jonny and his friend Hadji search for useful items and solve puzzles. If they encounter an adversary, the game switches to a side-view. JonnyÆs then got to defeat his opponent in classical beat-em-up-style with a variety of punches and kicks. After a short time, Hadji and the dog Bandit appear on the scene and help Jonny by casting spells (Hadji) and dragging the enemy around (Bandit). If you lose, youÆll get two additional chances; after that, itÆs hasta la vista.All main actions (talk, look around, access inventory) are performed via the F-keys; more sophisticated possibilities like using items involve strings of F-key/direction key usage. The puzzles are of the &apos;find item, use item&apos; variety.More information about the Jonny Quest TV series can be found in the trivia and links sections.</plot>

  <plot>Featuring the English national squad in a top-down soccer game, England Championship Special represents British publisher Grand Slam&apos;s attempt to cash in on both England&apos;s respectable semi-final entry at the 1990 World Cup and the popularity of Anco&apos;s acclaimed Kick Off series.With its 1991 release, English Championship Special is somewhat awkwardly set in between the 1990 World Cup (England made the semi finals, its best result since 1966, then lost to Germany and to Italy in the third-place match) and the European Championship of 1992, to which the &quot;Championship Special&quot; part of the title refers. The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you&apos;ll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match.While Grand Slam got the England team and manager to officially endorse the game (thus having names and photos of 20 squad members from Robson to Gascoigne), they didn&apos;t buy the Euro Championship license. You&apos;ll be playing seven out of 22 European nations for the &quot;Champions of Europe&quot; title in a nondescript international tournament, from group matches to finals.Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don&apos;t affect the ball at all.</plot>

  <plot>In Black Box there is an 8x8 grid which contains several atoms hidden in it. Your job is to find the location of all of the atoms by projecting rays from the side of the box and observing what happens. If a ray directly hits an atom it will be absorbed. Rays that pass within one box of an atom will be reflected. After you have fired enough rays, you can venture a guess as to an atoms location. To help prevent random guessing you lose points for a ray that completely misses an atom or an incorrect guess about the atoms location, and gain points for rays that are absorbed or reflected and for a correct guess. If you get stumped you can end the game early and peek at the location of all atoms.</plot>

In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back.Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.</plot>

  <plot>A strategy game with cartoony graphics and an innocent line in humour. At the start of the level you choose a starting point, the intention being to get lots of flat land as well as resources to mine and ideally existing sources of trees, stones and water (for fish). Your people are vying for supremacy with up to 3 others.The gameplay focuses on resource management. Each building requires a certain amount of wood (and stones for some of them) to be constructed and requires particular resources to perform its function successfully. Food must be produced (either fish, bread (requiring a windmill, grain-farmer and baker) or pork (requiring a pig-farmer and butcher as well as the grain-farm) to feed the people working in mines to produce the iron, coal and gold (as well as additional stones).Huts and Watch-Towers are built to expand your territory, sometimes at the expense of an enemy&apos;s land (clever play involves targeting an area where your opponent has a crucial building, thus compromising his production). To finally win the level, you must defeat your opponents. Combat is fought one-at-a-time by the little soldiers and a victory results in all surrounding buildings being lost.The game features 30 preset missions. 6 tutorials missions will help beginners to learn the game mechanics.The game also offers the possibility to play semi-randomly (based on a 16-number key) generated maps.The map size varies from small maps, for quick matches, to large maps to, depending on how much RAM is available, huge maps, for very long matches as the fact that the in-game statistics can be displayed on a 50-hour scale illustrates.These semi-random maps can be played in single-player mode but can also be played by 2 players on one system, if you have 2 mice, in which case the screen is vertically split.</plot>

  <plot>Young Simba just can&apos;t wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba&apos;s father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you&apos;re skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</plot>

  <plot>Veil of Darkness is a adventure game with RPG elements featuring a fixed isometric perspective and a fair share of action-RPG style combat.You take the part of a cargo pilot whose plane is shot down by a mysterious force while flying over a remote valley in Romania. A helpful village girl named Deirdre rescues you from the crash and takes you to her father Kiril, who informs you that your arrival via plane crash marks you as the chosen one who is prophesized to destroy Kairn. Kairn is the local vampire lord who long ago murdered his father and brothers so he could inherit control of the valley. Ever since he&apos;s used his powers to cut off contact with the outside world Kairn has been living it up, torturing the villagers with madness and death, feeding off of them like livestock, turning the village women into his personal vampiress servants, and generally being a spoiled pain-in-the-butt.Meanwhile the villagers are miserable, as every day they face the possibility of either being devoured by werewolves, gnawed on by zombies, driven into stark raving lunatics, or turned into vampires by Kairn and his posse.Since Kairn has cut off all ways out of the valley the only way you&apos;re going to leave is, as the old saying goes, over his dead body. That&apos;s not going to be very easy, however. Wild animals and unnatural creatures roam the countryside. While some villagers wise to help you rid them of Kairn, others have been driven mad with despair and by the valley&apos;s oppressive aura, causing them to commit unspeakable acts or otherwise act in an unhelpful manner. Even your most trusted allies may turn out to have a few skeletons in the closet...</plot>

  <plot>As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.</plot>

  <plot>Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx&apos;s Destroyer (1986).ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.There&apos;s no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open ôDeltaö option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.</plot>

  <plot>At the height of the World Wrestling Federation&apos;s European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord&apos;s Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter&apos;s Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.The game is a beat &apos;em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent&apos;s strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.</plot>

This continues until you reach the rank of Grand Admiral, where you are able to view the whole map.When you are in command of a region, you must worry about its economy. Ensure that taxes are collected and that the people are well-fed and reproducing. 75 new scientific discoveries can be made over the course of the game.Your enemies are a bunch of alien races. They each have their own style of architecture, ships, and land-based units. However, some are more inspired than others. Diplomacy options ensure that all-out war is not the only way to victory. In combat you have ships to protect and mercenary pirates to deal with.There is a plot-driven interactive movie element to the game, with an opening movie, and cutscenes appearing whenever you advance in rank and also at certain other points in the game. Voices used in these are computer generated. The player has to refit every single ship manually. The land battles resemble Command &amp; Conquer , though with only vehicle units.</plot>

  <plot>Apollo 18 simulates a fictional mission to the Moon in the early 1980&apos;s, following on from the last real flight (Apollo 17) before NASA cancelled the program. One of the game&apos;s key features was digitised speech, which sounds crackly like a real mission controller would. Telemetry screens provide realism, with the player having to set items and computer programs to get the crucial GO signal. The game is split into several sequences. First is launch, where pressing the button to stop a moving bar at the right point determines success. Course corrections and an orbital rendezvous (to undock the lunar module) are next. The player had to land the module safely on one of three possible landing sites before running out of fuel. The moonwalk was next, and must be completed in a set time before returning to orbit. On the way home the astronaut performs a spacewalk to capture and repair a satellite. Finally there is the tense re-entry sequence and splashdown.</plot>

  <plot>Commander Keen 2: The Earth Explodes is the second game in the first trilogy of Commander Keen platform games, called Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons.In this episode a Vorticon Mothership is poised above Earth, preparing to destroy the planet with their deadly Tantalus Rays! Commander Keen&apos;s mission is to stop these evil Vorticons from blowing up the Earth. In order to do this you need to find and destroy each X-14 Tantalus Ray, powered by cells from the big purple Space Amoeba. The game begins with a top-down map of the mothership. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter. On each level, you have to find the exit; if this is one of the levels with a Tantalus Ray, you&apos;ve got to destroy the Ray before exiting. Once you reach the exit, you&apos;re back on the map of the mothership. The levels are typically full of enemy creatures and hazards. If Keen gets shot or touched, or falls into a pit or hazard, he dies, and you&apos;re booted out of the level back to the overhead map and lose one life. Thankfully, Keen can defeat some of the enemies with his raygun. He also has a pogo stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include keycards that open locked doors and bonus items which give score (Keen gets an extra life if he collects enough score).</plot>

Eight-year-old genius Billy &quot;Commander Keen&quot; Blaze, the hero of the universe, the saver of planets has a problem: his mom forces him to eat yucky vegetables. This night, he dreams that he found himself in the land of Tuberia, where sentient vegetables live and reign supreme, and where the evil king Boobus Tuber enslaves children brought by his Dream Machine.The objective is to reach and destroy king Boobus Tuber, but before this happens, Keen must find a number of Boobus Bombs which are the only things that can harm the king. The game begins with a top-down map of the land of Tuberia. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter. On each level, you have to make your way to the exit, collecting Boobus Bombs on the way if there are any on this level. Once you finish the level, you&apos;re back on the overhead map. The levels are full of evil vegetables of all kinds and deadly hazards. If Keen gets hit or touched by an enemy, or falls into a pit or touches something hazardous, he dies, and you lose one life. Unlike in other Commander Keen games, Keen does not have a raygun or a pogo stick to help himself. Rather, Keen fights his enemies with &quot;Flower Power&quot; - special bombs which can be thrown to temporarily turn enemies into harmless flowers. If they miss an enemy and fall to the ground, they can be retrieved. Other items to find include: keys to open locked doors, bonus points that give score, an extra life and a rare &quot;magic eyeball&quot; which gives three extra lives and a lot of ammo.</plot>

  <plot>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It&apos;s effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn&apos;t leave the playing area, and doesn&apos;t hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a &apos;defensive flick&apos; involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</plot>

  <plot>Inner Worlds is a side-scrolling fantasy action game in which you play the role of a woman named Nikita who happens to be a werewolf. The game consists of three episodes (the first was distributed as shareware, you had to buy the full game to play the other three).In the first episode, Nikita is trusted by the village elder to free her people from the Gralob, an evil creation of a misguided genius, so she must travel to Castle Drofanayrb where the creature lurks. In the second episode she finds out that the Gralob was only one of two horrible creatures. And finally, in the third episode, she must travel to a volcanic mountain, inside which the secret of Drofanayrb lives, to fulfill her destiny.The gameplay is quite simple. You can jump, climb, crawl (same things in wolf form, however you&apos;re much smaller as a wolf, thus you can squeeze through narrow passages and you have a special &quot;frenzy&quot; move that tears enemies apart). In some levels you can find necklaces that upgrade your health, mana or attack damage. You can find weapons such as hammers, swords, or bows, and you can upgrade them with scrolls giving them unique abilities (ex. the hammer can &quot;throw&quot; lightning). You can also find different gems that give life or mana and potions that help jump higher, fall slower. Mana is needed for spells that you can aquire from level bosses. Each episode consists about 9 levels, and every third level has a boss.The enemies consist of animals, and experimental creatures of the castle. So you&apos;ll encounter spiders, bats, huge centipedes, alien-like creatures, huge green beasts that can stretch their arms.The graphics of the game are a little strange as the characters are in 2D but the scenery and the foreground is a little bit 3D. The music creates an eerie mood suitable for the game.</plot>

  <plot>Your name is Kevin Codner û rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and &quot;shipsmarts&quot;.In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can&apos;t use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.Each level has a certain &quot;save limit&quot;, meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you&apos;d better be on time with some assistance.At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.</plot>

  <plot>Oligopoly is a turn based strategy game for two to six players which is similar to the board game Monopoly. The object of the game is to build up your business empire and become the richest player while other players are forced to either declare bankruptcy or resign. The game world consists of 52 different countries, each of which contains one company. You begin the game with 100 million dollars, and need to travel around the world to buy companies. Each turn begins in the board room, and then you will be randomly sent to one of the countries. If the company there hasn&apos;t been bought yet, you have the option to purchase it, but if another player already owns it you will have pay them a profit for landing there. In addition to landing on a property, you also have other options on each turn: you can invest in companies you own (this increases their profits), borrow money, pay back money, sell companies, make deals with other players, or even resign if there is no hope of winning. Each turn is equivalent to roughly a months time.Each of the companies available is part of a different industry (chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, and textiles). In addition to building plants, you may also increase your companies profits by building vertical monopolies. To obtain a vertical monopoly, you must own three companies, one in each area of a particular industry (for example, a vertical monopoly in the electronics industry requires that you own companies in copper mining, semiconductors, and computers). Their is also a fifth industry which is owned by the computer and cannot be bought by players: shipping. Since the companies owned are located in different countries, each player will need to pay shipping costs every quarter (every three turns). A players shipping costs are determined by the number of companies owned, their locations, and what industries they are a part of. From time to time, a random event may occur on a players turn which can help or hinder progress. Natural disasters can destroy factories, workers may strike, you may have a chance to gamble at a casino, you may take a vacation (and lose a turn!), you may receive a grant from Washington D.C., or you may become ill are some of the events that can occur.</plot>

This body consists of five different types of cells: The proto cells (the &quot;flesh&quot;) will grow quickly and aimless, unless you border them with skin. To control proto growth, you can install control cells; they consume energy produced by support cells. Sense cells will provide you with information about the well-being of your organic entity. The basic cells will grow all by themselves, but also rot if left unattended. Your task is control: Move or destroy unwanted cell blocks, build and link a power supply throughout the structure, prevent decay and (in later missions) virus attacks. There are 99 levels to fulfill. Early ones make you rebuild a given design; later on, you&apos;ll have to reach goals like a certain amount of energy stockpiled.

  <plot>Pete Cooke&apos;s follow-up to the previous space shooter-explorer takes things away from the Tau Ceti setting. Players take the role of a student at an academy for advanced piloting. There they need to solve 20 simulated missions on a wide range of planets.The self-contained missions mean that the game uses the Tau Ceti structure and theme, without the causality of previous decisions having an effect on later choices. This reduces the complexity of management. Although players can customize the ships, including giving them names of your choice, the game comes with supplied ones include a variety that should suit many different circumstances.Whichever vehicle is chosen, players will control it from a 1st person perspective and a series of controls. All ships skim over the surface of the planet and feature weapons. Most missions will involve destroying rogue robots enemies. Players will have to dock with buildings to refuel or move on to a different planet.</plot>

  <plot>Star Command is a quite unknown sci-fi role-playing game by SSI, designed by Phantasie designer Winston Douglas Wood. It features a huge universe to be discovered, detailed character generation and development, a mass of items, some exotic aliens and tactical space and squad-level combat, similar to SSI&apos;s Pool of Radiance released the same year and other games of the Gold Box series. The game has nothing to do with Star Command Deluxe or Star Command: Revolution.The game plays in a distant future. Earth is a distant memory, having been destroyed long ago. The small human population is concentrated in a small portion of the galaxy, called &quot;The Triangle&quot; due to its form, and threatened from its neighbors: The Alpha border is plagued by pirates, recently united under a certain &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, the Beta border is frequently ambushed by an intelligent insect-like alien race who is thought to plan an all-out war. The third border leads to largely unknown territory with space-faring robots of unclear origin. The only hope for mankind is the Star Command, the headquarter of military forces. You control a spaceship crew, trying to secure peace by completing missions issued by Star Command.Game starts at Startport Luna, where you first will have to assemble and equip your crew and buy a starship before rushing out saving humanity.Assembling the crew, i.e. character generation, is quite detailed and done by first recruiting and then training characters. Each character has seven basic stats like Strength and Intelligence. If the stats look okay, you select one of four classes (Pilots for flying ships and communicating with aliens, Marines for espionage, Soldiers for fighting, and finally Espers with strange psi powers). The character now has to be trained for eight years; each year, you select a skill to be trained, and, if you&apos;re lucky, the character increases his skill -- he may also learn nothing. Skills can be trained more than once, increasing the effective skill level. All in all, there are 18 skills, with a different set available for each class. Some trainings does not improve skills, but basic stats -- Special Forces, for example, increases speed and accuracy.Character usually start out as Privates, but they the rank can be increased by going to Officer&apos;s school. There are 13 ranks up to Grand Admiral, with increasing pay -- money is sparse, so this may be a good choice. Then again, it may be not. Later in the game, with enough funds, you can create clones of your character to replace him when he dies. Character also age during play.After you have created your crew, it&apos;s time to spend your money. First of all, you need a spaceship -- there are nine different ships, with different attributes like armor or fuel capacity. The ship may be upgraded by several systems, including from engines, guns, shields, drop ships, computers, etc. Finally, you have to equip your crew, again choosing among a vast selection of armor, weapons and miscellaneous items. Having a fully equipped crew at your disposal, you&apos;re now ready to get some mission from the Space Command and launch your ship!While in space, you are shown a view of the environment, with commands at the bottom and the crew or ship status on the right. The galaxy is quite big, consisting of 32x32 sectors, each containing several systems, with each one having up to 10 planets. You can select the view, changing from Galaxy Scan (showing the whole galaxy) to Long Range Scan (showing 8x8 sectors) to Sector Scan (all systems and starports of a sector) to System Scan (the star and its planets) to Visual Scan (direct view of a planet, starport or space station with its statistics).While travelling through space, you may encounter ships. The game then switches to turn-based tactical combat -- but that may include peaceful interaction. In each turn, you first have a selection of communication strategies -- bargain, plead, ask, demand, even impersonate a deity are possible. Then you can move and rotate your ship, and finally, you can fire.Some situations, for example when you&apos;re boarding an enemy ship or while travelling on land, you can engage in squad combat, which closely resembles spaceship combat, but is influenced gravity, atmosphere and terrain.One some missions, you will have to explore underground complexes, which may contains traps and other specials events.There are 17 missions all in all, but they have no time limit, so you can do other things -- and you should, like trying to get some cash. Additionally, some missions are randomly generated, so each game differs somewhat. Character get training after each completed mission, but they can also pay for it, which is very expensive.All in all, the game play is simple to learn, but quite complex and addictive despite the crude graphics and nearly non-existent sound, as the game emphasizes on character development and atmosphere.</plot>

  <plot>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung&apos;s mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &quot;Fatality&quot; on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game&apos;s fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</plot>

  <plot>West life is nothing easy. Especially if we consider that in most of the towns exists a series of people who suffer from two defects: avarice and presumption. This is the case of the Zorton Brothers, two gunmen and real bad guys who think that they are the center of the world, and that all the other mortals must obey them. In addition, they enjoy killing the weakest and making them suffer, something that we are sure you, intrepid &quot;justiciero&quot;, can&apos;t allow anymore.The Zorton Brothers have arrived at a calm, Pacific town whose sheriff acts as more decorative than practical. He is small, weak, without aim and too talkative. Before this panorama, the Zorton have decided to seize the town with the inestimable aid of their band. It is up to you to save the town from their clutches.Los Justicieros&quot; is a conversion that comes from the &quot;Zorton Brothers&quot; Laser Disc arcade game made by Picmatic on 1993.

  <plot>Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic text adventure game. The player begins as an &quot;adventurer&quot; standing near a white house in a nice forest, but soon descends into the Great Underground Empire, where most of the game takes place. The player&apos;s quest is to collect the Nineteen Treasures of Zork. As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as &quot;examine mailbox&quot; or &quot;take torch&quot;. For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as &quot;north&quot; or &quot;east&quot; - or just &quot;n&quot; and &quot;e&quot;), and can check what items are being carried with the &quot;inventory&quot; command (or just &quot;i&quot;). Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first &quot;text adventures&quot; and is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its popularity in the &apos;80s.</plot>

  <plot>In 1992, Maxis published A-Train, a railroad management simulation by Artdink, a developer of some renown in Japan but virtually unknown anywhere else. A-Train was the third episode in ArtdinkÆs Take the A-Train series, which dates back to 1986. An earlier installment of the series had been internationally published three years prior to MaxisÆ A-Train by Seika Corp., under the name of Railroad Empire, with little to no public recognition.In a goal-oriented approach, your task as a railroad tycoon is to build a trans-continental track that connects New York with California in the US scenario, England with Turkey on the (considerably more challenging) Europe map. With transportation service limited to passengers only and scheduling options minimized, creating smoothly running train lines is comparatively easy û just make sure that trains donÆt collide on the single-track lines. The main focus is on efficient track building using the A-Train, which you control directly. A limited supply of rails and geographical barriers such as rivers with few pre-constructed bridges make careful planning essential. Optional cargo trains help distributing building materials to the station closest to your A-Train. In a unique feature, days pass in an accelerated real-time day/night cycle, with track-building only possible during daylight and changes to train schedules and switches only allowed at night.</plot>

Every aircraft from USNF was kept, with lots of new planes and some new weapons. One of the new features was a comprehensive Jane&apos;s research suite on all the game&apos;s aircraft, weapons, vehicles, ships, etc.There are 2 full campaigns, lots of single missions, an in-game mission creator, and a quick mission creator. Replay value was further increased by Duosoft&apos;s toolkit, which allowed players to greatly modify the game with custom add-on libraries. The game focus is on futuristic aircraft and campaigns, with many of the flyable aircraft still in development at the time of the game&apos;s development.

  <plot>Panthers in the Shadows is a tactical and hex field based war simulation. In five WWII scenarios, e.g. the invasion of Normandy. the player controls either the Axis Powers or the Allies. Aside from the scenarios there are the game modes &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Defend&quot; or &quot;Encounter&quot; where the attacker has to move to the opposite end of the map and the defender has to prevent this. In the encounter mode both opponents are gaining ground. Most of the game is played on the hex field map where movement and attacking orders are filed. Other windows include statistics and detailed settings. There are two phases: In the first one the player give his orders and in the second one the orders are carried out. The execution phase also is divided in several phases: Airstrike, arty, surprise fire, defensive fire, and movement. For the results of the orders the game uses several complex calculations, e.g. every shot from a machine gun salvo is calculated separately. The sighting also uses this calculations and take the vegetation, lighting or smoke into account. It is even possible to see some units in a hex field but not all.Another important feature are order delays. Orders travel from TF headquarters to the battalion HQ and then to the individual unit. Other things the player has to consider are tactical possibilities like carpet bombing or amphibious assaults and the morale which affect every other action. If the morale of a unit is too low they surrender or go berserk. There are absolutely no animations in the game, all fighting results are shown in text messages</plot>

Jacks or Better: The most popular form of Video Poker, you must get a pair of Jacks as a minimum to win a hand;2. Joker Poker: Similar to Jacks or Better, but with an added Joker card, which can be used to represent any other card in the deck, therefore improving your hand.3. Deuces Wild: All deuces (&apos;2&apos; cards) are considered wild. However, you now require a hand containing three of a kind as a minimum to win a prize.4. Multi-Meter Progressive: This is almost the same as Jacks or Better, but you can bet up to six coins in this mode. Whenever you bet six coins, a special jackpot increases. The more you bet six coins, the larger the jackpot.5. Double Down: The game begins just like Jacks or Better. If you get a winning hand, you have the chance to double your winnings by playing against the computer. The dealer will draw a card, and you will have a choice between four different ones. If your card is higher than the dealer&apos;s, you win double your prize. You can continue doing this as long as you wish, or until you lose.6. Second Chance: The game plays like Jacks or Better, but if you win and the computer notices you have a chance at getting a straight or better with a card, it&apos;ll ask you if you want to try it. You can then bet again and if you win, you earn your original payoff plus the bonus one.The game also keeps a score of your total winnings, hands played, and other statistics.</plot>

  <plot>Noctis is a game that is very similar to Frontier: Elite II and its sequel, but it is also very different at the same time. While the Frontier series is focused on combat and trading, Noctis is more geared towards space exploration. Considering that Noctis seems to have been conceptualized and designed by a single person, the results of the effort exerted into the creation of this game is nothing short of impressive.In Noctis, there is no sentient life in the galaxy you are set to explore. Even your own race has disappeared, only leaving behind a small fleet of manned scout ships whose mission is to catalog and explore all the stars in the galaxy. You, of course, control one of these scout ships.You can travel to any star you want to, at any time, provided you have enough fuel (as in Elite and the Frontier series of games). There are 11 different types of stars that you will see in this galaxy, and each star system out of the possible MILLIONS that you can visit have their own unique system of planets and moons, which you can land on and explore most of the time (landing is handled by a method that is similar to the landing system in Starflight). The star types range from S00 class stars, which are similar to our sun, to S11 stars, which are highly radioactive pulsars. You can label the stars and planets in most of these systems with any name you can think of, provided it&apos;s not a real star or planet name from our galaxy, or if the name hasn&apos;t already been taken by another explorer.When I say &quot;taken by another explorer&quot;, I mean that you can upload the names of the planets and stars you&apos;ve explored, and also upload any notes you&apos;ve taken regarding the explored celestial objects to the official website, which will then get released in a download that will also contain notes from other explorers. You can read their notes about the planets and stars they&apos;ve discovered once you integrate the information into your copy of Noctis.Noctis is a game that is played in real-time and has a persistent universe.</plot>

  <plot>Conquest of Japan is a strategy title in which you must conquer your opponents cities on the Island of Honshu in 16th century Japan. The ten cities must be occupied to win, you do this by forming armies to defend your five cities and attack those of your opponent. When a city is taken, any mobile army that came from that city is automatically disbanded. In this way, potentially overwhelming forces can be routed by conquering their cities -- but only if you can conquer the city before its army reaches its target. Depending on how the cities are located at the start of the game, you may find this to be a key part of your campaign strategy. When armies battle, the game switches from the strategic map, to a tactical one. Formations, unit orders, and moral are factors in the tactical battles.</plot>

You control both Cobra and Lady, each equipped with a gun. Shoot at everything that moves, and try to find the exit of the multidirectionally scrolling arena. As a backup weapon, you have also a set of five grenades to throw at troublesome enemies. Being hit once or twice is no problem, for you have a rather well-stocked energy bar. Controlling two characters at once means that you may be separated while rounding a corner or another obstacle, but the obstacles can also be used to regroup into a tighter or wider formation, depending on your choice of tactics.This tie-in uses a high resolution, at the cost of colours, to animate the screen with a high detail. Sounds is quite minimal, with no in-game music and simple sound effects. All in all, the game plays like a slower, isometric Gauntlet without the powerups.</plot>

  <plot>Rocks &apos;n&apos; Diamonds is a puzzle game, based on the concept of Boulder Dash. The player&apos;s goal on each level is to collect all the gems and reach the exit, avoiding hazards (such as falling rocks or hostile monsters) and solving puzzles (e.g. skillfully digging sand from under rocks so that they fall in the right way, giving access to some gems). The game comes with a level editor, and with 4 sets of levels, which are converted versions of levels from the classic games: Boulder Dash, Supaplex, Emerald Mine... and Sokoban, a different puzzle game where the player&apos;s goal is to push objects into proper places. The Supaplex levels feature the graphics from the original Amiga game. An enterprising level designer will quickly find out that the level editor contains tons of possible elements to cram into the map - there are countless types of monsters, many different types of gems, some keys and doors, switches, and other interesting elements. The game can be played with up to 4 players simultaneously on one computer.</plot>

  <plot>Operation Harrier is an action game starring Britain&apos;s famous VTOL aircraft. It uses an enhanced version of the Rotoscape system first used in Creative Materials&apos; earlier Rotox: the own plane is seen from the top and when steering left or right the polygonally rendered background rotates around it. A new addition is the ability to change altitude. The game consists of several missions, each with a specific goal like destroying an enemy cruiser or power plant or defending an airfield from enemy fighters. Before a mission, the Harrier can be armed with a variety of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles as well as two types of bombs. Standard armament is a forward-firing cannon with unlimited ammunition. A radar screen and a map help finding the enemy during a mission. Fuel is limited, but in some missions in-air refueling is possible. While the Harrier can survive a few hits, it can also be repaired (and refueled) after mission&apos;s end. Sometimes it is also possible to make a mid-mission resupply landing at a friendly base.</plot>

The most important ones are the tracking systems (e.g. radar, active or passive sonar) and weapon systems (e.g. torpedo, rockets or anti-aircraft). Every station offers many settings or actions to consider. These can be reached from the bridge where the player can switch between the stations by clicking on the corresponding monitor. There is also a tactical map which can be used to start attacks. Typical mission goals are destroying enemy units (ground targets, submarines, ships or aircraft), escorting friendly units or recon missions.</plot>

  <plot>The second installment in the series represents the advertisement of the Ford&apos;s 1990 product line and consists of five sections.DRIVING SIMULATORCustomizing the controls (i.e. using the keyboard,mouse, or joystick and related functions), sound, level ofdifficulty and type of driving, you may select the game of your choice from three different driving events: Test Track, City Challenge, or Back Roads. Test Track event is divided on Drag Strip (you have to drive straight shifting the gears up as smooth as possible), Amoeba Track (you have to drive as fast as possible on the whirly track), Obstacle Course (you have to drive as fast as possible on the whirly track avoiding as much pylons as you can).City Challenge takes place in Airport, Shopping Center, and Downtown. Each place is a whirly road with other cars in your way.Back Roads have three distances: 5 miles, 10 miles, and 15 miles. They are also whirly tracks with the trucks.During gameplay you should drive in first-perspective view behind the wheel of the Simulator Car (S.C.). There are three levels of difficulty to choose from: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. Running off the road or hitting an object at the Intermediate and Advanced levels disqualifies you from the game. Also most of the events require manual gear shifting on Intermediate and Advanced levels and automatic one on Beginner level.Finishing the track, you may see the results such as your average speed, the number of avoided obstacles, and the score you earned. The score is calculated dynamically on the basis of difficulty level.ELECTRONIC SHOWROOMMenu of 16 vehicles allows you to see the picture and description of the vehicle you have chosen. FORD BUYER&apos;S GUIDE&quot;Buyer&apos;s Guide&quot; provides you with names for eachmodel category, giving you an overview of Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles, trucks, and vans. It also provides you with a list of &quot;specifications&quot; on the vehicle and allows you to choose additional information such as standard features, optional features and packages, as well as compare two vehicles, or prepare a &quot;financial spreadsheet&quot;. The Buyer&apos;s Guide information may be printed out. FORD INFOCENTERElectronic sampler of innovations in Ford Motor Company vehicles may be examined through menu of the desiredfeatures. Each feature is described by text with supporting animation sequences.CUSTOMER FEEDBACKThis section will allow you to provide The Ford Motor Company with your opinions. You should complete the on-line questionnaire, then print out your answers or put them on a sheet of paper, and mail to the address indicated in the program.</plot>

  <plot>Before Electronic Arts sought to imitate television coverage of sports with their EA Sports titles, Cinemaware had the same idea, initially applying it to (American) Football. Cutscenes follow dramatic moments in the match, and each match is preceded by a TV-style introduction. The game is primarily action-based, although you also choose your plays before executing them. You then bring the passes and runs to life on the pitch itself. You can play single matches or full leagues, with any of the NFL teams of the time.</plot>

  <plot>You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.As if gravity and accurate flying wasn&apos;t challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who&apos;ll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you&apos;ll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.</plot>

  <plot>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late &apos;80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player&apos;s pointer can move along.The player&apos;s object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</plot>

The object of the game is to eat all the food that there is in the level. Once all food is eaten by Roy, a tone will sound, meaning that the gate that leads Roy into the next level will be open. Stopping him from doing this is insects and other wildlife, including rats, birds, bats, and many more. Roy is able to fix this, however, by using a variety of weapons like his foot, his fat tummy, carrots, mushroom bombs, and my personal favorite, his burp. He can also jump in the air and land on his ass to get rid of enemies. If he touches an enemy, he loses one of his lives. If he loses all his lives, the game is over. Once Roy has collected all the food in a stage, he has to face a boss that is usually much bigger than him.Fatman can also pass flags, which lets him continue where he left off if he loses a life.

  <plot>Reach for the Stars is the original &quot;spaceploitation&quot; game. The player has the opportunity to name his civilization and those of his (up to three) AI opponents before he begins his attempt at galactic domination. The game is very bare bones by modern standards: the 2D galaxy map is marked only by planets and their names in few different colors. Also, there is no diplomacy and no player control over tactical combat.What remains is a hard-core game of grand strategic and economic production. The player must tweak his planets, build ships, research new tech levels, and deploy fleets. A nice feature of the game is that just about all of the underlying dynamics can be altered and customized by the player, which means that Reach for the Stars is infinitely replayable.</plot>

  <plot>In the 24th century, on the frozen Jovian moon of Europa, earth has established a colony to extract water from the moon. One of the mining facilities accidentally discovers on their excavations members of a long-buried alien race. The creatures, now awake, slaughter all the miners and destroy the moon&apos;s capital city. It&apos;s up to you now to defend what&apos;s left of the colony and eliminate the aliens, or at least hold them off until help arrives.Gameplay consists of 3D space combat action (though mostly on the moon&apos;s surface) with a twist: you don&apos;t play a specific character or campaign, instead you are placed on the shoes of different characters with each new mission. Each trying to do their best to survive using 7 different vehicles, from starfighters, to recon scouts, to ground-based turrets.</plot>

  <plot>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple &quot;ditch-a-hot-car&quot; jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player&apos;s wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.</plot>

The focus is on the realistic simulation of the ten aircraft, this means for instance that there is no indicator for ammo. The game features several missions which can be either played independently from each other or in two campaigns for the United States or Japan. The goals are mostly to liberate an area, to defend an area or to destroy a specific target. The special feature of this game is that it also can be played as strategy game. On an overhead map the player gets presented with the position of all aircraft and he can order his troops around. The player can take control over every aircraft he wishes to and switch between both modes instantly. He can also record his performance and cut small movies with different camera angles out of them.</plot>

Ryu can collect up to 2 ninja shadows that follow his every movement and use the same weapons at the same time that Ryu strikes.Ninja Gaiden II tells its story through liberal use of cinematic scenes interspersed between the action levels. Different levels feature a variety of environmental interaction; e.g., one level has Ryu on a high mountain where snow is falling fast and the wind is blowing hard. The shifting direction of the snowfall indicates how the wind is blowing and Ryu has to fight against the breeze. In a night level, much of the environment is dark and is illuminated only sporadically by flashes of lightning.</plot>

There&apos;s even talk of a mysterious Monolith, secret character of great power, hidden somewhere in the tournament.Gameplay is similar to normal Pong but with the exception that each Paddle also has a projectile attack that can harm the opponent. First player to 10 points wins the match and will activate the words &quot;FINISH HIM!&quot; wherein the player has the chance to enter a command sequence and complete that particular paddle&apos;s finishing move... gore and all.

One day the curious girl uses the wand; as a result, an evil demon is unleashed into the world. The spirit of the wand, a rabbit-like creature known as Sirius, tells Marble that it is now her responsibility to save the world from the demon, whose vile plan is to brainwash and sexually abuse ripe pretty young girls!Marble Cooking is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The game consists of seven stages; each stage has one-screen levels. Marble is inserted into the level, with hostile creatures of various kinds (ghosts, books, demons, gangsters, brooms, etc.) wandering around her; the girl dies if any of the creatures touches her. The only way to defeat the creatures is through summoning Sirius. First, it is necessary to place a line of carrots on the floor. At any time afterwards, the player can call Sirius by pressing a button; the rabbit will then re-trace the carrot line, stopping where it ends. The goal is to time all this in such a way that the hostile creatures will collide with the running rabbit, leading to their demise. The levels get more complex as the game progresses, with room layouts (corridors, angles, and so on) working against Marble, more aggressive creatures with hard-to-predict movement patterns, etc.Scenes with explicit sexual content (mostly involving various fetishes, torture, and other sexual deviations) appear between stages.</plot>

Some of the missions include destroying all enemy vessels in a given area, surveillance requiring you to identify the location of enemy ships (without sinking them!), or to escort a supply ship through hostile territory. As missions are successfully completed you earn points based on how successful the mission was, and with increasing points you can advance in rank, from deck mopper up to admiral. Your performance on one mission won&apos;t have an affect on future ones, and you can choose to play missions out of order as well. Several missions include other craft you can control to help out (both ships and helicopters). A time compression mode is included, which can be used to reduce the amount of time waiting to arrive at a destination, or even left on to make the action sequences more challenging.</plot>

The player can reenact six crucial carrier battles from that era including Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Midway, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz and the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.The game features completely new graphics including a menu overhaul to make more use of a windowed interface. Most important in the graphic overhaul is that combat is now presented in animated graphics.Gameplay has also changed with new features including fire damage on ships, which can be repaired, but can also easily spread to do more harm (and this too is graphically represented). More airplanes can be commanded and now individually inspected instead of in squadrons. The AI has also been refined to play more like a human player with imperfect information available to it.</plot>

  <plot>Last Half of Darkness is an adventure game that takes place entirely in and around a haunted mansion, complete with graveyards, crypts and foreboding swamps. It is considered by some as the forerunner of the Horror genre in adventure gaming, featuring a gloomy atmosphere, spooky music, creepy sound effects, and a spine-tingling, suspenseful storyline.Your aunt was a type of voodoo witch in New Orleans who made potions to help friends and neighbors with their afflictions. She was killed, and you have inherited her entire estate - with a catch! In order to receive the fortune coming to you, you must finish the potions she was working on and solve the mystery of her death.Explore the scary old house, endure the sudden noises and ignore your pounding heart. Search for clues and objects and solve puzzles to unravel this mysterious story of terror.Graphics in the original version are 16-color EGA and are a collection of stills. The main screen is divided into 5 major sections: Graphic Gameplay Screen, Inventory, List of Exits, Commands, and a description box at the bottom. Position your mouse on a command (Move, Examine, Take and Operate) and left-click to perform that action.There is also a VGA version of the game, released in 1991, featuring revamped graphics. The rest of the game is exactly the same as the first EGA version.In the Windows re-release, the story remains the same. This version has improved graphics, sound and video cut-scenes. However, puzzles and locations are different from the original DOS releases. The gameplay screen is expanded to full size with the command menu placed at the bottom of the screen.</plot>

  <plot>Universal Warrior (or The Machines, as is the official title of the PC version) is a top-down maze shooter in the vein of Gauntlet and Alien Breed, with added economic elements. The game alternates between equipment management and the actual in-level action, in which a remote-controlled robot runs through maze-like maps and shoots mechanical enemies. With the money earned in these sci-fi contests, improved equipment can be bought in five categories, making the robot more powerful, more maneuverable and less easy to damage. On the other hand, getting damaged means you must spend money on repairs. This encourages careful and effective playing.The game can be played solo, competitively in two-player hot-seat mode or cooperatively in split-screen mode.The Amiga and the PC version of the game have the same basic design, but entirely different levels. For a comprehensive list of differences between the versions see the trivia section.</plot>

  <plot>Viewed isometrically, this role-playing game saw you leading a party of four intrepid souls on a mission to restore peace to the land. Sixteen levels awaited them, all filled with traps and monsters. Spells could be collected as the game went on, and multiple ones cast in quick succession. The characters could be split, and sent off on different routes and tasks to save time.The gameÆs title was inspired by its innovative use of light, or rather of darkness. Nothing could be seen without the torches your characters had; these meant that vision faded outside their circular arc. You had to manoeuvre the torch around to reveal secret areas, and it could be used to ward off some monsters, although it alerted others to your presence.</plot>

  <plot>The Time Spinners do not look kindly on failure. They&apos;ll yank your status, terminate your entity, and zap you into the netherest of the nether regions. Your journey begins when Executive Time Spinner (ol&apos; T.S., you know) drops youill-prepared and poorly armored into the fray, to fight off everything the Razerrians ...antiquated holdouts fromthe Snarr Sector... can drop, kick or throw at you. Blast through their defenses, traverse the 50 levels of time blocks they&apos;ll use to impede your travel. They&apos;ll tantalize you with pictures from your home planet, hurl you through space,instead of merely time, and dazzle you with nefarious patterns reminiscent of the arcades in the Neo-Draconian Sector in a celebrated age long past.As for other Break-out clone games, the basic plot is: BLAST IT! When you hit the blocks, they explode, disappear, change your launchpad into something more (or less!) functional, or alter the &apos;ball&apos; in some beneficial - or nefarious - way. The worst of these is the dreaded smiley. The smileys don&apos;t do anything. The ball metamorphoses into a cute, fluffy, and USELESS tennis-ball-like blob, and won&apos;t work on any of theblocks until it turns back into a blue piece.Some of the blocks put a nasty spin on the ball, and there&apos;s a magnetic block that does exactly what you&apos;d like it NOT to do. You can also add spin to the ball by striking it on the move - just like with table tennis. The longer the ball is in play, the faster it moves, and the less time you have to hit it.Some effects are controlled by a timer, and will revert to their previous state if you can outlast the time clock.In Two-player mode, saves (and losses), and multiple-ball episodes, are twice as much fun, and it&apos;s only half as difficult to win. You can also play two-player mode with one person! Just select the SAME input device for both players in the setup menu.</plot>

  <plot>Castle Ralf is a shareware interactive fiction first released in 1987.The background story: While driving out on holiday, you get lost in the middle of nowhere, when suddenly your tire has a puncture. Remembering a driveway just before the tire blew, you return to it, and guess where it leads? Right, to Castle Ralf. (Reminds me of Rocky Horror Picture Show, that.) The game starts with you trying to enter the castle.Once you did it (this won&apos;t be too difficult, but will cut off the way back), you&apos;ll quickly find that Castle Ralf is quite big and peculiar, extending onto three floors and a basement, including a Grand Central Closet and a sauna. You&apos;ll find some keys, enough burnt pizza for 87 people and a gigantic cheese, a video game called &quot;Chiwawars!&quot; which you can play, but also some technical puzzles which you will have to solve, designed by the castle&apos;s slightly eccentric owner, some Dr. Bellefleur.Castle Ralf features an innovative user interface: Besides typing your commands the traditional way, you can also select verbs with the cursor keys. This comes with a simple but well-done parser which understands some unusual and/or useful words, like IT, MAP (which gives you a map of the places you visited so far -- interactive fiction with automapping!), SMELL or COGITATE (which may or may not give you some hint). You can also use multiple commands, as &quot; N. W. S. GET BEANS. All in all, the parser / verb selection combination works quite well, once you got used to it.The game&apos;s puzzles are quite challenging, but logical. As you will die a lot, you should SAVE often.The texts are short and to the point, being often quite funny and even a little Zorkian. They thus manage to convey a unique atmosphere while you are exploring the vast castle and try to solve Bellefleur&apos;s devious mechanical puzzles.</plot>

  <plot>The adventure of Tipi is a classical side-scrolling Jump&apos;n&apos;Run game with Manga-like characters and animations, similar to games like Elfland, Realms of Chaos or Commander Keen.You play Tipi, a young warrior who lost his (future) wife to the mighty red dragon who rules the land. To bring that terrible reign to and end Tipi decides to kill the dragon. However before you finally reach the dragon you first have to pass six levels, each one with an own setting and a level boss. In a typical Jump&apos;n&apos;Run style you have to jump from platform to platform and fight the numerous enemies with your sword. Fortunately you won&apos;t die immediately if an enemy touches you, instead you have a life bar which can be refilled by jumping over various food items scattered around in the world.Each level contains doors in various colors which can only be opened when you have found the matching key for it. Those keys are that important that the number of keys already found is always shown in the upper right corner.The game has no savegame or password system, so you have to start all over again if you lost all your lives or restart the game.</plot>

  <plot>Front Lines is a tactical wargame of the &quot;near&quot; future (set in 2020 or 2044, depending on whether you play the U. S. or German version). It can run in either single-player or two-player mode, and can use a head-to-head feature by modem. All the usual forces of the modern army are present, but by this time heavy laser weapons have become practical, soldiers wear powered armor, unmanned ground strike aircraft are common, tanks can hover as well as roll, and artillery projectiles are even more powerful and accurate than they are today.You command your army, which may incorporate some U. S. forces, in the European theater. Some of the opposing forces answer to a corporate conglomerate. The roles of offensive, defensive, and supply assets have to balanced properly. The game progresses through a series of land battles over various kinds of terrain -- and the terrain gives varying combinations of advantages and disadvantages. The game has some limited representation of Europe&apos;s real-world geographical features, which gives a sense of why they are militarily important. For example, you can see the importance of the Fulda Gap, just as it was important in previous World Wars, and just as it would have been important if the Cold War had become hot.Each battle has one or more objectives, and also a time limit. To win, you must accomplish your objectives while stopping the enemy from accomplishing his, and you must do this before time runs out. Each objective accomplished earns you a certain number of victory points. At the battle&apos;s end, the winner is the player with the most victory points.</plot>

New season offers the player the chance to race against sixteen other competitors on any of the four racing machines competing for season points as well as money to upgrade equipment.Choose between roller blades, a luge (basically a sit-down skateboard), a mountain bike, and the skateboard. The player can also determine which character they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus. For example one might be top-notch at roller blading but be bad at bike-riding so there is no point choosing the bike with him/her. In a season, the player competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the obstacles become more and more tricky to avoid as well as the other racers becoming faster and more agile. The tracks are: Italy - Country roads leading down to a town area; Lake Tahoe - Twisting roads and strategically placed haystacks;South America - Lots of caves and thin jungle roads; San Francisco - Hundreds of obstacles and hills; Utah - Falling rocks, secret routes, and some hungry looking crocodiles.</plot>

  <plot>Fantasy General is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world with some steampunk/high-tech elements. The forces of evil, in the form of the dreaded Shadowlord and his henchmen, have conquered most of the world. On the brink of defeat, the player (in the form of one of four heroes) is summoned as champion who will change course, free the world and defeat evil - or lose all.The game features 10 unit types from four realms with lots of upgrades, complemented by a similar plethora available primarily to the opponent. Most of the game takes place on battle maps. Outside of those there&apos;s just a bit of basic recruiting, setting research priorities and financial managing. Battle maps are hex-based and feature lots of different terrain types that require a suitable approach - cavalry will rule on plains but is crippled in swamps. The player should build an army that is composed of the right mix of units and can adapt to new situations.The game will look similar to players familiar with Panzer General since it uses a modified engine of said game.The game offers two modes: the campaign against the Shadowlord or arena mode (single battle) against a computer or human opponent.In campaign mode, the player selects one of four heroes, each with his or her special abilities and sets out to defeat the Shadowlord. The player must prove his or her own ability to adapt play style and army across five continents with different challenges until the player finally defeats the Shadowlord on Fire Isle.</plot>

The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.DOOM&apos;s engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein&apos;s, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein&apos;s orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein&apos;s arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect &apos;frag&apos; points for a kill and re-spawn in a random location after being killed.</plot>

  <plot>In today&apos;s moral climate, it seems that almost everyone is living by the rule &apos;kill or be killed&apos;. Some people are taking the idea to extremes, plunging into danger just to prove that they are really tough and a lot stupider than the rest. In this game, players control Kwon, dubbed the Human Killing Machine. He has vowed to demonstrate the power of his homeland; and does this by battling a series of opponents in several countries such as Moscow, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. HKM uses the term &apos;knockdown&apos; for players who defeat their current opponent. Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent.Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.</plot>

Carrying a parting message from Roger&apos;s old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future.. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, sometime in Space Quest XII. The series has gone to ruin without it&apos;s hero, Vohaul rules all.. Roger must quickly hotwire a time pod and undo Vohaul&apos;s plot. The most logical way to do this is to run amok through past, future and the end of the universe, having a few laughs along the way. If there&apos;s a few spare moments, he might swing by the galaxy&apos;s biggest mall, charm his ex-girlfriend whom he knows nothing about and provoke some brawly monochrome bikers living in the original graphics of Space Quest I.Space Quest IV is the first in the Space Quest series to feature Sierra&apos;s SCI interface (better known as &quot;VGA icons&quot;). Sierra&apos;s standard icon set, used here, includes icons for Walking, Looking, Using/Pickup, Smelling, Tasting as well as inventory access.

  <plot>Death Knights of Krynn is the 2nd volume of the Dragonlance epic and is the sequel to Champions of Krynn. Characters from that game may be imported to this game.This time the party faces an undead threat that turns former friends into fierce enemies and infests Krynn with hordes of decaying monsters. The party must find the origin of these nightmarish undead creatures and eliminate it in order to save Krynn from turning into a land of undead. Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection with the availability of the &quot;Knight&quot; class, unavailable in AD&amp;D non-Dragonlance RPGs. Characters in this game may level-up to higher levels and obtain new skills as well as more powerful spells. Experienced Knights may ultimately choose one out of 3 &quot;clans&quot; to focus more on a different type of fighting style.Adventuring consists of either overland map travel or the standard 1st person town adventure. The player&apos;s party consists of 6 characters (of which one must be a Knight) as well as possible NPC characters joining your party. Wandering monsters will of course attack the party on occasion so gear up and prepare for undead monster-bashing combat!</plot>

Similar to Zork (which was released on the VAX mainframe not long before Acheton&apos;s original appearance), it is a fantasy treasure hunt set in a claustrophobic dungeon. It boasts over 400 rooms and 200 objects, thereby making it much bigger than Zork. As with many games of this kind the most time is spent by exploring the environment and solving item-based puzzles. Everything is described solely with plain text and the player interacts with the game by typing in phrases which describe his desired action, e.g. &quot;take bottle&quot;.

  <plot>Mega Blast is a game based upon simple rules popularized by such classic titles like Dyna Blaster or Bomberman. A couple of players are placed in a maze and each of them have time-bombs at disposal. The goal is to eliminate adversaries; players can achieve this by detonating an explosive when enemy is in its range.The walls and obstructions will initially make it difficult for you to move, but most of them are not resistant to explosions, so you can blast your way through. When you knock down a part of the maze, it may reveal a hidden bonus, like increased firepower, additional bombs, and so on. The most important thing, and the core concept of the game, is that bombs have delayed explosion time. You have to be very careful and pay attention where you place them, so that it won&apos;t turn out later that not only you did no harm to your enemy, but took your own life instead.</plot>

  <plot>The Future Classics Collection is a collection of five distinctly-themed games that stress action and strategy equally. The programmers of the games had previously worked for Cinemaware and MicroProse.The gameplay of the five games is extremely varied:DiskMan: Backup your computer disks; collect as many disks as you can, avoiding all hazards along the way and inserting the disks into the disk drive to open the exit to the next level.Tankbattle: Work your way across a battlefield to capture the opposing coat of arms to open the exit to the next level. Avoid turrets, bombs, and other obstacles.Lost &apos;N Maze: Quickly travel through the corridors of the maze until you locate the keys to the exit. Collect various power-ups and bonus points along the way.Diet Riot: Put all the junk food stores out of business by having your man gather all the food crates for each store and throw them in the dumpster. Beware of junk food -- eating it slows you down and threatens you with a heart attack; you can &quot;work out&quot; using the exercise equipment to speed back up, as well as eating healthy food.Blockalanche: An isometric-view Tetris clone, with the differences of being able to select your next piece (if you&apos;re quick enough) and being only able to rotate your block around one axis.The gameplay options are also quite varied: Each game can be played one player alone, two players alternately, two players simultaneously, or one player against one of three computer personalities -- including split-screen play for head-to-head competition.</plot>

  <plot>Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.As the nation&apos;s leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won&apos;t survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won&apos;t produce anything until you fix the situation. If you&apos;re ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you&apos;ll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they&apos;ll demand tribute from you), but eventually you&apos;ll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents&apos; units and cities (possibly taking over them). Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies&apos; cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you&apos;ll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you&apos;ll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you&apos;ll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there&apos;s too much of it, global warming may occur. How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you&apos;re living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it&apos;s a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.</plot>

It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game&apos;s commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum systemFIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it&apos;s possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup.

But while Keen was exploring Mars, the alien Vorticons stole vital parts from his ship and hid them in the Martian cities. Now Keen must find the stolen parts if he wants to return to Earth. Commander Keen 1: Marooned on Mars is the first in a series of platform games. Your objective is to find the 4 missing parts to your ship. The game begins with a top-down map of Mars. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter. On each level, you have to find the exit, and possibly grab a missing rocket part which may be on the level. Once you reach the exit, you&apos;re back on the map of Mars. The levels are typically full of enemy creatures. Most numerous are Yorps, which are mostly harmless, if annoying, but other creatures are a genuine danger. If Keen gets shot or touched, or falls into a pit or some hazardous object, he dies, and you&apos;re booted out of the level back to the map of Mars and lose one of the lives. Thankfully, Keen can defeat some of the enemies with his raygun. He can also find a pogo stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include keycards that open locked doors and bonus items which give score (Keen gets an extra life if he collects enough score).</plot>

  <plot>This BBS door game has a misleading name: rather, it should be called &quot;See how much you can get away with bugging the SysOp before he wakes up&quot;, the SysOp being (for those of you who weren&apos;t online at the time) the system operator of a bulletin board service the player remotely dials in to. Often the BBS computer would be running in the SysOp&apos;s bedroom, and frequently users would pester the SysOp with the oft-abused (P)age SysOp menu command, which would make his computer beep and chirp to get his attention. What&apos;s the emergency? What? You&apos;re bored? You want me to install better door games? Well, ok.This is a game played from a BBS&apos;s log-off menu, when the user is already on their way offline, and simulates varying levels of harassing a hypothetical and simulated SysOp, for points, with the dire consequence of being kicked offline should the virtual SysOp actually roll over in their simulated slumber and be disturbed. A low-key cyber-Russian Roulette, if you will. Higher-point harassment (choosing the option to call the SysOp&apos;s voice line, for instance, or hollering outside their window) bears with it a greater chance of failure and disconnection. High scores are noted, and players can compete among themselves on a call to call basis to see who stays on top.</plot>

  <plot>Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager is the sequel to Dark Sun: Shattered Lands. Although it has the same engine and basic gameplay as the original game, the graphics have been improved considerably with larger character sprites, etc. Like its predecessor, this game is a departure from the earlier Gold Box Dungeons &amp; Dragons games and is more akin to Baldur&apos;s Gate. Instead of a first person &quot;maze game&quot; focusing on dungeon crawling, the game has a third-person top down view with more of a focus on interacting with the characters and environment.The game takes place from a top down perspective from which the player views the world from above, and they control their character&apos;s actions with a mouse-driven icon-based point-and-click interface similar to those used in adventure games. Combat takes place on the same screen/environment as the normal adventuring portion of the game, and is turn based where the player issues their commands and then the computer issues its commands.Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager follows from Dark Sun: Shattered Lands, taking place on the barren burning wasteland planet known as Athas. Characters from the first game can be imported. After defeating the Drajian Army in the first game, the party journeys to the recently liberated city of Tyr whose evil Sorcer-King Kalak was recently slain. Although freed from Kalak&apos;s Tyranny, Tyr is now defenseless against the ambition of the Dragon (Athas&apos; resident Ultimate Evil). The Dragon sends his powerful undead general the Lord Warrior to Tyr to conquer it and prepare for his coming. The player&apos;s characters hook up with a rebel underground known as the Veiled Alliance and must oppose the Draxans and the Lord Warrior, all the while they are secretly being observed by the Dragon through his crystal ball thingy (he makes various nasty comments about their progress during the map load screens). The party soon learns that the Dragon may be the least of their worries, however, as it becomes apparent that the Lord Warrior has his own hidden agenda and intends to unleash a long dormant monster of immense destructive power upon the world.</plot>

  <plot>Reaping the Dungeon is a turn-based, randomized dungeon crawler in the vein of Rogue and Hack. Below the surface of Jupiter, a machine runs out of control and floods the underground tunnels with synthetic creatures. You must descend into the depths to find and destroy the machine. The adventure is split into a freeware episode of 15 levels titled The Weapon Recovery and the second episode The Machine, which contains 50 more levels and must be purchased.The basic challenge is to explore each dungeon level and collect treasure while fighting enemy creatures in simple hit-vs.-hit fashion. Precious metals and gems can be sold in shops to buy better weapons and equipment; raw crystals gained from defeated enemies help improve your characterÆs abilities, such as damage ratio, sight range or performance speed. Through battles and careful exploration, your protagonist becomes increasingly more powerful and efficient.All level layouts and contents are randomly created. Each level introduces one new creature and at least one new map element or item.Reaping the Dungeon adds a number of original elements to the genre:1. The drop shaft that leads down to the next level relocates in random intervals. It must be found and tagged. Data chips scattered throughout the level reveal its current location;In addition to weapon/device energy and health, your character has an oxygen pool. Each step consumes oxygen, which makes uncoordinated running-around in the dungeon wasteful and potentially life-threatening;Energy, health and oxygen can be harvested from cell plants, which grow in a five-step life cycle. Good timing is essential to maximize the cell harvest;2. Reaping the DungeonÆs magic system is based on rare mushrooms that give special powers for several turns, such as improved sight range, perfect weapon proficiency, seed planting or the ability to walk through walls.Reaping the DungeonÆs graphics consist entirely of customized 16-color ASCII characters. The sound is limited to PC Speaker noises.</plot>

You started off managing one of the teams in the Conference, and had to try to reach the Premier league and win European competitions, either by improving your current club or by doing well enough to earn job offers elsewhere.For each match you had to select the team, and choose a formation and a set of match tactics - intensity of tackling, height and length of passes, and shooting range could all be varied. In total there were almost 500 permutations of these options, as well as 18 basic formations.You could sign players from other clubs, which involved making a financial offer to both club and payer and hoping that no other club offered more. Players who&apos;s contracts had expired could be signed for no club fee - so make sure all your players are under contract.You also had to negotiate sponsorship deals, plan ground improvements, ensure that injured players got the right treatment, set up training schedules, and hire backroom staff (such as coaches and scouts).</plot>

  <plot>In this domino game, two players are each given a hand of five square tiles with numbers on each side. The players take turns placing these tiles onto a seven-by-nine grid, but tiles can only be placed next to one another if their touching sides have the same numeric value. Fortunately, tiles can be rotated to find the best possible fit. Every time a tile is put down, the player that placed it scores a number of points equal to the number of sides touching tiles already on the board multiplied by the values of those sides. Certain areas of the board are marked as BONUS or MINUS squares -- placing a tile on one of these causes a player to immediately gain or lose twenty points. The game supports player vs. player, player vs. computer and computer vs. computer play, and it also has three difficulty levels. Higher difficulty levels feature a greater variety of tiles for players to cope with. In-game hints are available if needed.</plot>

  <plot>This is a remake of the game Bolo for Atari ST. It is a Breakout variant with a twist: Your paddle is not restricted to the bottom of the screen -- it can move all around the screen. Your goal is still to destroy all the blocks on the game field.There are a lot of gimmicks in the 50 levels: lack of gravity, ice levels with slippery controls or various paddle forms. Sometimes a rubber band is used to tie the ball to the paddle, to a block or even combinations of the two. Even the blocks offer a big variety of effects: magnetising the ball, teleport the ball, obscuring the game field or the summoning of killer paddles are just a few of them.You can only save one game which gets deleted if you load it. Every level has a illustrated background. When scoring a highscore of 50,000 points or more you get access to a training mode where you can choose the levels directly.</plot>

  <plot>Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit. The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it&apos;s up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal&apos;s face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</plot>

  <plot>Big Rig is a simulation that lets you experience the life of a long-distance trucker. Your task is to safely drive a 18-wheel tractor-trailer combination from coast to coast in time, trying to make a profitable trip.The gameplay and user interface are pretty basic. The game is played in text mode only, with your choice made by typing the right letter at the prompt. At the beginning of your trip, you can choose between three types of cargo (with or without time limit, perishable or not) and three routes -- each with different characteristics, like length or chances for bad wheather etc. After these preliminaries, you begin your trip.Gameplay is turnwise. At each turn, you choose your travelling speed (go too fast, and you may be stopped by the police -- too slow and you may not arrive in time). YouÆll have to keep an eye on your fitness and your gasometer û driving tired can result in deadly accidents, and running out of gas will cost you time and money. Gas and sleep can be replenished at truck stops.YouÆll also be slowed down by roadworks, flat tires, accidents, traffic jams, bad weather -- all those little things that make trucking fun! To get to New York in time, youÆll need strategical planning, and a small amount of luck, too. And you&apos;ll get to learn a bit about the daily chores of your average trucker.</plot>

  <plot>In 2045 terrorists conquer a island in the Pacific Ocean and declare it an independent state. Because the whole world is afraid of these terrorists they send a mercenary group named Panic Soldiers on the island to drive them away. The game is a real-time strategy game which emphasizes on the combat aspect without base building.Before every mission the player chooses which combat robots and pilots he wants to use. They are distinguished in three attributes: defend power, attack power and accuracy. With every solved mission the used pilots get experience points and as a result increase their attributes. The robots don&apos;t earn experience but can be upgraded or replaced with money which is earned by completing objectives. These are mostly to kill all enemy soldiers and destroy their buildings but sometimes the player has to rescue soldiers. The game uses standard real-time strategy controls: With the left mouse button the player gives his units move or attack orders.</plot>

  <plot>The year 1942 is the subject of many computer games that deal with World War II. The reason: this was the year that many pivotal battles were fought including Midway, Stalingrad, N. Africa, and... Guadalcanal. This game deals with the desperate battles fought in the Solomon Islands, specifically in and around the island of Guadalcanal, in which the Allies tried to stop the Japanese from their drive to Australia. In TF42, you can play as either the Americans or Japanese. All the major ships that participated are represented, including the infamous Yamato and devastating Iowa. It features individual historical battles, as well as the whole Guadalcanal Campaign.The objective in the Campaign is to take over both bases on Guadalcanal, but as you are the Naval commander, you do not have direct control over the land battle. Your main objective is to keep the marines on Guadalcanal supplied and bring reinforcements to them, to shell the enemy base, and to stop the enemy from bringing supplies and reinforcements to their troops. These 3 tasks are accomplished by assigning the ships available to you into Task Forces and Task Groups, and send them on Patrol, Supply, and Bombard missions. More ships become available as time progresses.The game has a strategic mode in which you can order your fleets around and monitor the overall situation, and a tactical mode in which two fleets meet and you can actually command the battle in real-time and &quot;jump into&quot; any ship and fire the guns or torpedos.You also have air support. The planes can patrol or, if you have fighters/dive bombers/torp bombers available, attack enemy fleets! The air units and amounts of planes available to you change as they did in the actual war.You can create your own &quot;Dream Matchups&quot;: Yamato vs. Iowa; North Carolina vs. Nagato; A group of New Orleans Heavy Cruisers vs. small but fast and deadly torpedo-armed Japanese destroyers... all the ships are available.</plot>

  <plot>The second of Lucasfilm Games&apos; air combat simulations and follow-up to Battlehawks 1942, Their Finest Hour recreates the Battle of Britain during WWII in the summer of 1940.Players can fly both for the German Luftwaffe and the British Royal Air Force.On the British side, two planes are available: the Spitfire and the Hurricane. For the Germans, there is the fighter Bf 109, the heavy fighter/fighter bomber Bf 110, the infamous Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, and the three light/medium bombers Do 17, He 111 and Ju 88.Next to training missions for every plane, there are several historical combat missions to be flown. In accordance with history, most RAF missions consist of defense assignments - intercepting and destroying German bombers. Most Luftwaffe missions are attack runs - either flying the bomber escort or the bombers themselves. In the heavier planes, not only can the pilot of the plane be controlled, but also the gunner(s), and, in the bombers, the bombardier.The special Campaign Mode allows one to actually change the historical outcome of the Battle of Britain. On a strategic map, planes must be organized into groups and assigned to missions, one of which must be flown. The outcome of that mission affects those of all others and also the status of the overall campaign. The British side wins by simply surviving for a certain time or by destroying enough German aircraft. The German side wins by destroying enough RAF fighters, either in the air or on the ground.Also included in the game is a mission builder for designing custom missions, and a film playback option for reviewing recorded flight footage.</plot>

The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however.There are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders.

  <plot>Peace had arrived finally at &quot;Cocovillage&quot; thanks to the good work made by Mad Mix, who had become the worthy successor of his grandfather. But the nightmare had still not finished, because a few miles away, in the town of his cousin Ope, &quot;Cococastle&quot; (a place crowned by a phantasmagoric Castle), it was happening a strange phenomena. All the indications made think that a &quot;coco&quot;, survivor of &quot;Cocovillage&quot;, had converted the Castle into his dwelling, establishing in addition a maleficent alliance with the sinister inhabitants from that place. The terror had seized the inhabitants of &quot;Cococastle&quot;, and only Mad can give back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants of this village.The game consists in eating all the &quot;coconuts&quot; (small ball species that are dispersed through all the Castle) which appear at every moment. Once you have finished with all the coconuts of the level you will pass to the following stay of the Castle of the Ghosts, this is the mechanic until you have been able to explore all its corners. However, you shouldn&apos;t care only in eating all the &quot;coconuts&quot;, but in addition you will have to be very kind trying to not collide with any of the inhabitants of the terrific Castle, as well as to avoid the different traps (or using them in your own benefit) while taking helpful -some with really curious effects- objects.</plot>

  <plot>Six levels of horizontally-scrolling shooting await in this R-Type style action game. The attack waves vary in style, with some attacking you from quite fiendish angles.These give off blue power-up tokens, which are used towards selecting one of many weapons. There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren&apos;t using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability).Each level has a very different setting, and an end-of-level boss to defeat. The chance to resume from the level you died at is offered up to level 3.Unusually, the game has an option to emulate an auto-fire function using software (this makes it one of the few Amiga shoot &apos;em ups you can hope to get as far through on an emulator on keyboard as on joystick on the real thing).</plot>

Like a typical shooting gallery game, your goal is to move a gun across the screen, shooting skulls, bugs, ghosts, and other creeps that pop up at random intervals. Every time you hit a target, you score points. Shooting a target usually results in an animation and sound effect. In some stages, gravestones move across the bottom of the screen to block you shots.

Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack&apos;s dilapidated mansion of Hell&apos;s Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That&apos;s where Carnby comes in.Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace&apos;s kidnapping).Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell&apos;s Kitchen and Jack&apos;s army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery. Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.</plot>

  <plot>Digger is a remake of the classic Digger, your task is to collect diamonds, try to stay alive from falling diamonds/rocks and avoid ghosts.The game offers 32 levels, once you completed a level, you get the level code for the next, so you can skip levels the next time you play.Once you started a level, you have 3 minutes time to collect the amount of diamonds needed to complete the level. At the time you&apos;ve done this, the exit is accessible and you can leave the level, but you can still collect the rest of the diamonds. You get 10 points per diamond, but only 1 point per second from the time from the 3 minutes you have spared when you exit fast enough. So for highscore purpose, it&apos;s good to collect most (or all) diamonds. After you gain a certain amount of points, you gain an extra life. Once you completed level 32, all remaining lives will be added to your score.Make sure, that you donÆt block your exit with a rock, or that you donÆt get trapped. If so, your only way to complete the level is by committing suicide and replaying it again.To make your diamond-collecting challenging, there a rock balls in the game. You can stand directly beneath them, but when you move just one square down, the rock will fall, and when you get hit, you&apos;re dead. This also happens to falling diamonds. So, if you must go down, move fast, and move then left or right to prevent impact. If itÆs only one rock, you can move them horizontal, as soon as there is more than one rock, itÆs impossible to move them further.Sometimes there are not enough diamonds in the game, in this case there are some sieves in the level, where you must put a rock on top of it, and if there is space beneath the sieve, the rock will fall through it, and gets transformed into a diamond. But of course, this is also a good idea to do this, when you already have the certain amount of diamonds to collect.And for a bit more challenge, there are ghosts in some levels, which you must avoid, or they kill you. The good news is, that they donÆt hunt you, they just follow a patrol route. The bad news is, who knows their route since most of the time, their route is blocked by a diamond or rock, once itÆs removed, they comingà But you can kill them, if you good enough to let a rock or diamond fall on their head, then they ôexplodeö and destroy all 8 squares around them, so make sure, you are not in one of them. But be careful, the explosion will destroy anything, including solid walls, and this may trigger more fallen rocks/diamonds.If you once become tired of the levels, make your own ones, with the included level editor.</plot>

Each track has a pit stop where cars stand still to be repaired, but they can be pushed out of the area. When going for kills, team members will not engage each other.There are different camera angles, a replay function, and both automatic and manual transmission.

  <plot>Set during the collapse of the Soviet Union, this arcade style game puts the player in control of a Soviet tank. This tank must explore the areas of Vilnius and Baku and rescue all Russian citizens. Meanwhile, the rebel armies will attack with everything they have.The game uses an overhead view of the battlefield and multi-directional scroll. The gameplay is reminiscent of games like SWIV, but the need to rescue a certain number of hostages to complete the level adds a limited strategy element: the goal of the game is not to defeat the enemies, a task literally impossible as they re-spawn within seconds, but to rescue the hostages before being blown up.</plot>

  <plot>Little Bombuzal has to blow up bombs on little islands in this puzzle game. In order to advance to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</plot>

  <plot>As the name suggests, this arcade conversion updates the basic Asteroids gameplay. That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising CorpÆs control.Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.</plot>

  <plot>This game is an Adventure/RPG hybrid set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland in the Northeastern United States. Toxic pollution and war have reduced the United States to a state of anarchy except for the occasional city-state. The player takes on the role of the Crimson Tape, the new leader of the Superhero League of Hoboken, imbued the amazing power to Create Organizational Charts. The team is joined by Tropical Oil Man (capable of raising the cholesterol level of his opponents), Robomop (an intelligent kitchen appliance capable of cleaning up almost any mess), Iron Tummy (capable of eating spicy foods without any distress), Captain Excitement (his &quot;aura of lethargy and dullness&quot; can put many opponents to sleep instantly), and Mademoiselle Pepperoni (capable of seeing inside a pizza box without even opening it).The goal of the game is to complete missions assigned by the Commissioner and relayed via the League&apos;s computer, Matilda. Gradually, the player will raise Hoboken League&apos;s ranking, and finally be able to take on the evil Dr. Entropy who is seeking to thwart the rebirth of civilization. As the League&apos;s ranking and prestige grow, new superheroes will join up and make life easier.Gameplay includes standard third-person adventure game interaction similar to other late Legend games such as Companions of Xanth and Death Gate, top-down map exploration, and turn-based combat (similar to Bard&apos;s Tale). Heroes have the usual range of stats (brawn, brains, toughness, and health) and equipment slots, along with their superpowers.</plot>

  <plot>The famous Indianapolis 500 Mile race, held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on the Memorial Day weekend, is one of the most famous automobile racing events in North America. The event is simulated here using 3D polygon graphics to recreate the 33 cars in the race. Players are able to choose their car and customize it with a variety of options. Modifications include wing down-force, tire pressures, wheel stagger (making the right-side wheels larger, to compensate for the banked corners) and turbo output (which provides boost, but stresses the engine and uses more fuel).After qualifying (by performing during four laps and taking the average) players can race over 10, 30, 60 or the full 200 laps. Lower modes remove car damage and the &apos;full-course yellow&apos; system, the absence of these can make for repeat carnage including traffic collisions and huge pile-ups.</plot>

Too late, and the duck will insult you.

You must guess how many out of 100 answered Yes or No. Your opponent then has the chance to guess whether the true answer is higher or lower than your answer. If you are right, you are taken to the &quot;Cards&quot; screen to play a video version of the &quot;High Low&quot; card game. Guessing correctly lets you keep control of the board, and the next question. If you lose, your opponent receives the next question. If you win enough times, you&apos;ll go to the &quot;Big Bucks&quot; card screen where you can bet all or part of your winnings on a more elaborate board of &quot;High Low&quot;.</plot>

  <plot>Trains is a top-down managerial game. In the age of steam powered trains, there are opportunities to make money on great railroads. It will be up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad and turn a profit. The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply raw material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing the whistle to begin the loading process. This is then delivered to the stations of industries that need them, unloading taking place the exact same way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of available industry supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can only be stopped and move forwards and backwards, following the path of the train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, where the track splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal, multiplied by the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the coal yard, and is loaded into the coal car the same way as other goods, spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of coal while driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered to the train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll and any crashed train costs another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique track design, and can take place across cities, deserts, mountains and plains. As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the edge of the screen which will lead to the next level.</plot>

  <plot>In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.This is the first game in the Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.</plot>

  <plot>Life &amp; Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You&apos;re the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you&apos;re kicked into the medical school, where you&apos;re given hints as to what you&apos;ve done wrong.</plot>

  <plot>A fan-made VGA remake of the original King&apos;s Quest using Chris Jones&apos; Adventure Game Studio engine. Besides the upgraded graphics it also features a point &amp; click interface, voices (optional) and MP3 music (optional).When Sierra remade their early AGI adventures using their new SCI engine, their first game, King&apos;s Quest, was also the first to be remade. Unfortunately this meant using SCI0 which still had 16-color graphics and a typing interface and not 256-colors and point &amp; click interface like the SCI1 remakes of Leisure Suit Larry 1, Space Quest 1, Quest For Glory 1 and Police Quest 1 had. So a group of King&apos;s Quest fans decided to do what Sierra didn&apos;t and supply King&apos;s Quest 1 with a worthy remake.In 2009 AGD Interactive released King&apos;s Quest I VGA 4.0, which can be considered a remake of their original 2001 remake. It contains the following enhancements:1. Newly enhanced game backgrounds and character dialog portraits that has improved the visual look of the game tenfold.2. All new &quot;no dead-ends&quot; gameplay mode (optional) to ensure that the game can be completed from any point.3. Full narrator speech and lip-syncing for all characters by the very talented professional voice actor, John Bell.4. Windows Vista support.5. Native Ogg Theora movies, which means in-game cutscenes/movies will now play in Linux and PC emulations under Macs.6.

Gameplay consisted of &quot;flipping&quot; tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</plot>

There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert. This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.</plot>

  <plot>Mindbender uses similar gameplay principles to Deflektor, which means that you have indirect control over a beam of light. On each of the 50 levels you must guide it from a starting point to an ending point, taking out all the enemies along the way. Rotating each of the many mirrors on the level to send the beam onto the points the enemies hover over does this û reaching many of them will involve several attempts at finding the right combination of angles. Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, Tron-style.</plot>

YouÆre not restricted to one city û you can build another area, linked by roads, once youÆve got the first one running smoothly. You have slaves at your disposal to build and maintain everything.

Needless to say, all of these problems crop up.Via the forums, you will get public opinions, which are affected by how high taxes are, and whether people feel theyÆre getting value for money. If they donÆt they could riot;û what will you tell the Emperor if that happens?Barbarian threats are commonplace, so you need to maintain an army, and at times send it into battle. If you own Cohort 2, you can fight the battles using that, but otherwise you just issue the orders then learn of the result.</plot>

  <plot>GameTek&apos;s home version of the classic game show The Price is Right. Bob Barker and the Beauties are not present, but a multitude of pricing games from the show, as well as the wheel and the showcase, have been faithfully replicated. Four (or a maximum of eight, counting both rounds - the programme suggests switching players) contestants can play, with the computer filling in for the rest. Whether bidding on Contestant&apos;s Row or playing a pricing game, contestants will attempt to closely guess the price of an item provided. All items in the game are often-unintentionally-humorous misspellings of recognizable brand names, to avoid trademark infringement.Pricing games include the Mountain Climbing (in which your 3 guesses must be less than $300 away in total, otherwise a goat will push you over the edge), Safe Cracking (in which you have 3 possibilities for each part of the price, and must correctly guess it) and the Dice Game (in which you accept or reject random rolls to get the real price).There is a persistent Hall of Fame with winners and their scores, and a parser for guessing/bidding prices. Players have to type in their price guesses, and answer to the math of how &quot;off&quot; they were, as they would if they were on the show.</plot>

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. On the way, you&apos;ll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</plot>

  <plot>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</plot>

In the &quot;authentic&quot; mode, you have only 2 weapon bays, but you have higher stealth rating. In the &quot;theoretical&quot; mode, you have 4 weapon bays like F-19 Stealth Fighter, but your plane is easier to detect due to a lower stealth rating.</plot>

  <plot>Aboard the lethal Gunship Gladiator helicopter, it is your job to ensure that a coup fails to install a dictator as leader. The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all you&apos;ll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.</plot>

Other than practice events, the player can perform an air show or just go for a free flight. In the air, players fly from a 1st person perspective inside the plane or a 3rd person perspective from a chase plane behind the player. Additionally there are 4 different camera views and 3 different gameplay speeds. After the flight, an analysis is displayed of the flight and the player&apos;s performance graded.</plot>

Take over any plane in flight if you think they need help. Send in DEA agents to gather more intelligence and resupply local rebels. Can you win the war?ATAC can be described as two games in one. On the strategic level, you need to figure out how the drug barons are forming their pipeline and the best way to destroy the pipeline while causing minimal damage to the civilian population, while defending your own base against intruders and attackers. You can order recon flights or gather intelligence from rebels and DEA agents on the ground. When you get enough intelligence, you can issue target orders to up to 4 crafts (F-22&apos;s or AH-64&apos;s). and they&apos;ll go accomplish those missions if they can. Once you&apos;re off in the air, the game becomes first-person simulator, where you fly through the jungles of South America chasing the target you need to destroy while fighting the drug baron&apos;s mercenary forces.

His glory is soon stolen away from him by the professor he&apos;s assisting at the University. The same professor he&apos;s been assisting for years in the hopes of tagging along for a treasure hunt. Tired of taking things lying down Nevada sneaks into the professor&apos;s office and steals back the ancient map he found and afterwards he runs home to pack his bags and outrun the professor to the tomb inside one of the great pyramids of Egypt. Once inside the pyramid, Nevada will face hazards such as traps, falling spikes, bottomless pits, and dangerous denizens of the pyramids including, bats, monsters, and of course mummies to say the least. Nevada must find a number of keys on each level to advance to the next level and must also be on the lookout for treasures. one other hazard in his way are mysterious winds that blow on certain levels which add to the challenge of exploring the level. Nevada isn&apos;t exactly defenseless however. His adventures begin with five lives and he&apos;s got a couple of spears which he can throw at the creatures in his way.Pharaoh&apos;s Tomb is a platform game where the player controls the actions of Nevada Smith. Nevada can run around and jump and he can also throw spears at enemies. More spears can be picked up on certain levels and bonus lives to give you a better chance at getting through the adventure can also be found or earned. Levels are passed once the required number of keys or treasures are found. Players can save their progress at the beginning of any level. Enemies in Pharaoh&apos;s Tomb are restricted to move in strict patterns and players must pay close attention to these patterns to avoid them. Throwing spears at enemies also requires some space between the player and the enemy and therefore enemies can&apos;t be speared when Nevada is right next to them.Pharaoh&apos;s Tomb is comprised of four volumes:1. Vol.1 - Raiders of The Lost Tomb2. Vol.2 - Pharaoh&apos;s Curse3. Vol.3 - Temple of Terror4. Vol.4 - Nevada&apos;s Revenge!The shareware version of the game is the entire first volume. Each volume of the game includes twenty levels taking place deeper and deeper into the pyramid. Pharaoh&apos;s Tomb uses a proprietary animation system called FAST (Fluid Animation Software Technology) which allows the game to run on older machines at a good performance level however the restrictions of this system are the enemies are located in bounding boxes and therefore players need to imagine a rectangle around enemies and other hazards in order to fully avoid them.</plot>

  <plot>Commander Keen has already foiled the Vorticons&apos; plans to destroy Earth. Now he heads to their home planet in order to confront the Grand Intellect: a mysterious leader who enslaved all the Vorticons and forced them to carry out his evil deeds. But before Keen reaches him, he must get through numerous Vorticon cities whose mind-controlled residents all received one order from the Grand Intellect: &quot;Keen must die!&quot;Commander Keen 3: Keen Must Die! is the third in a series of platform games. The game begins with a top-down map of the Vorticon planet. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter. On each level, you have to make your way to the exit. Once you reach the exit, you&apos;re back on the overhead map. The levels are typically full of enemy creatures (mainly various types of Vorticons) and hazards. If Keen gets shot or touched by an enemy, or falls into a pit or something hazardous, he dies, and you&apos;re booted out of the level back to the overhead map and lose one life. Thankfully, Keen can defeat most enemies with his raygun. He also has a pogo stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include keycards that open locked doors, bonus items which give score (Keen gets an extra life if he collects enough score) and the Ankh, which gives temporary invulnerability.</plot>

  <plot>HergΘ&apos;s famous cartoon character is brought to life in this multi-stage action game, specifically based around the episode of the same name. In many details the story was similar to the real moon landings, then many years off. A more accurate title for the game would be &apos;Tintin Gets to the Moon&apos;, as reaching it is your challenge. The game is split into two distinct types of sections; the first of these involves guiding the rocket through space. Steer it to avoid contact with asteroids, and to collect eight red spheres. Yellow spheres boost energy, and so should be collected.This is followed by a platform-based battle, as the evil Captain Jurgen has tied up several crew members, planted time bombs, and started several fires. Use your extinguisher on Jurgen and the fires, and touch the bombs and crew members to solve those problems. Turn gravity off to reach the more troublesome bombs.</plot>

  <plot>The Cardinal of the Kremlin is a global management simulation.It is the time of the Cold War. An American ground reconnaissance satellite discovers a strange structure near the northern border to Afghanistan. It is identified as project &quot;Bright Star&quot; - the Soviet laser ICBM defense system, capable of destroying satellites and airplanes with a beam of energy. At the same time, the USA is busy developing their own SDI project, code name &quot;Tea Clipper&quot;. And as the race for the deployment of a space-based laser defense system begins, KGB and CIA agents swarm out to infiltrate the laboratories. Among them: The United States&apos; top spy in Moscow, the Cardinal of the Kremlin.Based on the popular novel of the same name by US author Tom Clancy, The Cardinal of the Kremlin puts you in the position of US project leader. Your task is to build, test and deploy a network of laser defense satellites before the Russians manage to do so. In this time of crisis, however, all your actions are overshadowed by the threat of espionage and treachery. The scientists that you hire may be geniuses, but are they trustworthy? The more technology tests you schedule, the easier it is for Russian spies to steal your knowledge. If you tighten up security on the other hand, the overprotection will throttle research efficiency. As you race against time and an invisible enemy, the word &quot;paranoia&quot; gains a whole new quality.Luckily, the counter-intelligence department is at your command, too. CIA agents in Moscow not only supply you with information on the Soviet project&apos;s progress, but also on KGB operations in the USA. How accurate the reports are, however, is for you to judge. You must also supply the Afghan warlords Archer with weapons and equipment, as only he can launch a desperate attack on the Bright Star base that will hopefully throw back the Soviet project for months. You conduct battles in a simple top-down action sequence.</plot>

  <plot>On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham&apos;s family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack&apos;s clutches.King&apos;s Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King&apos;s Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the &quot;Walk&quot; cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the &quot;Eye&quot; cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing &quot;Look at&quot;. The &quot;Hand&quot; cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The &quot;Head&quot; cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King&apos;s Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don&apos;t get stuck or have to start right from the game&apos;s very beginning.</plot>

It contains 15 new single-player levels spread over three episodes, a new deathmatch level, and new monsters, weapons and power-ups.There are two new monsters: The Centroid is a huge mechanical scorpion who uses his sting for close attacks and two nail guns implanted in his claws for firing from afar. The Gremlin is a small and fast creature which can steal the player&apos;s weapon and use it against him.New weapons include the proximity mine launcher, which fires grenades that will attach themselves to walls, ceilings or floors. The grenades are motion-sensitive and are triggered when creatures walk near them. The laser cannon fires energy blasts, which can bounce off walls, possibly coming back at the player or hurting another enemy. The final new weapon is the Mjolnir, being the hammer of Thor. Running on energy cells, it sends out bolts of lightning at enemies when hammered on the floor.Among the new power-ups are the Empathy Shield, which gives some of the damage received by the player back to the attacker and the Horn of Conjuring, which summons a creature to fight by the player&apos;s side.</plot>

  <plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football&apos;s world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &quot;isometric&quot;) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>

  <plot>Curse of Enchantia is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based interface.Lil&apos; Brad didn&apos;t believe in witches until he met one. The evil hag torments the fantasy land of Enchantia, and has just summoned Brad from the Earth as an ingredient to her potion of eternal youth. Brad doesn&apos;t like this plan. And who would be better suited to rid Enchantia of the sorceress than a tender teen? Well? A heavily armed mercenary? Yeah, good point, but there&apos;s none available, I&apos;m sorry. Brad&apos;ll have to do.Starting in a prison cell, you help Brad free himself and find his way on the ocean floor, through a medieval city, a junk yard and an ice castle. You command Brad via an icon bar that pops up if you press the right mouse button. Our hero can perform plenty of actions, e.g. wearing, inserting, combining or fighting. Apart from steering Brad around, you do not need to click on the screen. Brad has to stand next to the object he wants fiddle with, which will then appear as an icon in the command bar.Curse of Enchantia features an interesting design element: The game manages to do almost without written messages. There are no object descriptions - the purpose of (most) items is apparent. In the rare occasions of interaction with other characters, symbols in balloons substitute words. If there is text on the screen, it&apos;s either signs or comic phrases - splash! You cannot die in Curse of Enchantia; in fact, doing potentially deadly things is often rewarded with funny animations.</plot>

  <plot>A version of an old Norse board game called King&apos;s Table. The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d&apos;etre. The white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some &apos;borrowed&apos; from chess.The presentation of this interpretation is similar to Battle Chess, with bold 3D graphics and lots of animation.</plot>

  <plot>It is 2124, and alien life has been found in our own solar system. The location of this life is just as surprising as its existence; There is a whole ecosystem living within the incredibly hostile atmosphere of the gas giant, Jupiter.When these findings became public, and the hostile nature of some of the creatures became known, the &apos;eye&apos; of Jupiter was declared a frontier zone. Of course, it wasn&apos;t long before someone thought of a great way to make money out of our new neighbours and the first Hunters were dispatched from earth. Now TVs across the globe display nightly broadcasts of Hunters engaged in blood-thirsty combat with the inhabitants of Jupiter. Does no-one care that these new life-forms are being wiped out in the name of mass entertainment?Well, I.C.E. care. The Interstellar Conservation Executive has sent you, its newest recruit, off to Jupiter to study and document all the lifeforms you can find. You make money not by killing them, but by filming their actions. You can then use this money to upgrade your ship&apos;s engines and descend lower into Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere, to discover even weirder creatures. You&apos;ll also find people who want you to collect rare objects for them (also in exchange for cash), you&apos;ll find strange alien artefacts that may or may not help you in your quest and you&apos;ll probably have to engage in a few fights with the Hunters. It&apos;s a little sick, but these images will be broadcast to the audiences back home, too, so you&apos;ll make more money from that. Still, better to kill an evil Hunter from earth than a peaceful space whale from Jupiter, right?</plot>

There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as &quot;OPEN Door&quot;). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</plot>

  <plot>The game uses the name of genuine cricketer and adheres to the one-day cricket 1991 rules interpreted by developers for the guidance.Contested by two teams of eleven players each, cricket is a very technical bat-and-ball game played on a grass oval-shaped field, in the centre of which are a flat strip of ground, called a cricket pitch, and two wooden wickets placed at each end of the pitch. The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard, fist-sized cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman, a player from the opposing team. In defence of the wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler&apos;s team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman ù if he or she does not get out ù may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the &quot;non-striker&quot;), who has been waiting near the bowler&apos;s wicket. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The match is won by the team that scores more runs.Choosing between a bowler, or a batsman, game player defines the role of its team. During the match game player may control all his team players, nearest to the ball to achieve the main goal. Power, direction, and the moment should be used properly to achieve it more successfully. Eight countries (England, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, South Africa, India, West Indies, and Pakistan) are available to select and game player/players may be appointed either to CPU, which has a three difficulty levels, or to human.</plot>

Although it&apos;s strategical simulation is rather simplistic, taking a more entertaining approach, it has many features, available options and a lot of feedback from the computer (including tips from the computerized Patton&apos;s and Rommel&apos;s).The game had a feature very similar to today&apos;s well-known Fog-of-War, though it&apos;s functionality was not as smooth as it is today.

  <plot>The UFOs are invading our skies! Reports of human and bovine abductions are increasing daily! Cities are terrorized! Something must be done!XCOM, or eXtraterrestrial COMbat unit, was founded as an international force to combat the alien menace. Start with one base, two fighters, one transport, and a few soldiers, you must stop the alien threat... once and for all.X-COM: UFO Defense is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can&apos;t afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished... You can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it decides you aren&apos;t operating efficiently enough within its region. It&apos;s even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether. Once you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.In combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though). The game aims to mix strategic considerations, resource management, and tactical combat considerations, along with plenty of authentic UFO lore.</plot>

  <plot>In the dark future the new brutal sports game will be invented - Killerball - a blend of American Football, Roller-Skating, and Pinball. The three leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by the level of brutality. The action takes place in a circular rink. Each team of five players should put the iron ball in the small hole of the opposite team to make a score, and do not allow the players of another team to make the same. Each team player has health indicator, which will decrease during the game, because the only way to take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any brutal way. Each match during the season has time limit, but it may be finished also if all the players of any team will be unconscious and at least one ball will be put in the hole.The game has a training mode, where you may play a single match with a computer or another human player, and tournament mode, where eight teams controlled either by computer or human players will fight for the victory. Tournament progress may be saved and restored.</plot>

  <plot>A top-down space shooter that was different from most others at the time in that it did not just scroll continuously in one direction, but could scroll at different speeds in all possible directions on the X and Y axis, on the player&apos;s whim.The game takes place above the surface of a ruined, devastated planet: each level starts within a large area, in which your ship has free movement. Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one.Absorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat. At 0% power, the game is over - although you may get an option to continue, based on how far you got.</plot>

  <plot>Compiled by iD Software in response to various commercial Doom wad collections like D!Zone, the Master Levels for DOOM II was intended to be the largest mega-collection of additional Doom maps (the &quot;Maximum Doom&quot; collection), plus twenty new official maps (the &quot;Master Levels&quot;).The &quot;Master Levels&quot; are twenty stand-alone maps from independent level designers commissioned by iD. There is no overall campaign or an attempt to tie the levels together, though some of the levels from the same designer do have a connected story of their own.Maximum Doom&quot; is a collection of 201 .wads (map packs with varying numbers of levels inside) for the original Doom and 1,629 wads for Doom II, leading to the package&apos;s claim of 3,000 total new levels. These wads are not commissioned by iD or made by professional designers, and no claim is made as to these being the &quot;most popular&quot; or &quot;best designed&quot; homebrew levels available. The maps were gathered from various free or FTP sites on the Internet; however, the time and dial-up cost for a player to find and download the same collection of .wads themselves would have been substantial.</plot>

  <plot>In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.</plot>

  <plot>Theme Hospital is a level-based hospital management simulation where players have to start on an empty building, and then assemble rooms with all kinds of material, from desks and file cabinets for the general diagnosis to the expensive ultra-scanners and x-rays to diagnose such bizarre diseases such as Bloaty Head, Slack Songue or Alien DNA, and treat them with with even more bizarre machines like an Head Inflator or a DNA fixer. There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don&apos;t have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.However, rooms don&apos;t run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can&apos;t run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they are sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms.As levels advance, the player faces increasingly harder situations: VIP visits, emergencies, epidemics and earthquakes, which can either take a toll on reputation or on the bank account. On the other hand, as more and more equipment is required, additional plots of land are available for purchase in later maps.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the 1950s TV series of the same name, The Honeymooners is a series of mini-games. Ralph Kramden wants to hold the annual meeting of the Raccoon Lodge at Miami Beach. However the treasury is fairly empty and in order to make his dream come true, the Kramden&apos;s and their friends, the Norton&apos;s will need to work extra hard and be a little lucky to reach the required amount. But Miami Beach is a popular destination, and the families must hurry before all the hotels are booked.The Honeymooners is really 4 different mini-games for one to four players who compete against one another. The goal is represented by a train car heading towards Miami Beach. The goal is to earn enough points (presumably representing money) to move the train car all the way there. In order to gain points, the player attempts to complete one of the following mini-games:1. No If&apos;s, And&apos;s or Bus: Ralph Kramden is a bus driver and must pick up as many passengers and take them to their destinations. The game is played as an overhead view over a map of steet names and passangers. The goal is to pick up waiting passangers and deliver them to the destination they want. The player only controls the bus&apos;s direction (up, down, left, right) and speed. Delivering passengers earns points but leaving passengers on the bus will lose points. Hitting other traffic or returning to the bus depot will end the game.2. Sewer I Do: Ed Norton works for the sewer company and has a map of the tunnels&apos; layout. However his map has blown away so he must navigate the sewers from memory, fixing leaks and eventually returning to his ladder. The game is played in first-person 3D maze with the player being able to move forward, back and rotate left and right.3. Going to Pieces: Alice Kramden works at a department store and is talking to Trixie when she drops a jig-saw puzzle. The player must reassemble the image before time runs out.4. Additionally, &quot;The $99,000 Answer&quot; is Ralph&apos;s favorite game show, sometimes appears at the end of mini-games as a double-or-nothing bonus round. Players must answer trivia questions related to The Honeymooners TV show. However game shows are all about luck and sometimes the player will win or lose randomly without a question being asked.</plot>

  <plot>Super Stupid Space Invaders is a ASCII graphic spin off of Space Invaders. You play a man who destroys aliens. However, there is no village to protect from the aliens.In each game there are two players, and every time one player loses a life, the other player continues right where that player left off. You control a small missile firing device with you arrow keys, left and right to move back and forth, and up to fire missiles. To move on to a new level you must destroy all the aliens on the field, sometimes the aliens reproduce each level. You can also hit bonus aliens for new weapons that fire more shots. When both players lose all their lives, you get a &quot;game over&quot;, and both players are put in the Hall of Fame. If you make it, your final standings for the game are shown including the final score, the level you made it to, your shots and hits, and your percentage.</plot>

  <plot>Something&apos;s happening in these lands, and the only hope seems to be the moonstone. You, as a chosen knight from the druids are about to find it and bring it back. The game can be played from 1 to 4 players at once, with no difference between solo and multiplayer as no matter how many players play, the story stays the same for everyone. However, if you choose to play with only one player/knight, the other three will be the computer rivals. Wandering through the map, you can visit enchanted places, towns where you can buy equipment or try your luck in gambling, but mostly visited places on the map will be cabins which represents the places where certain enemy beasts are. Each spot has about two or more beasts which after defeating them can be rewarding in a certain way, depending on game&apos;s randomize placement.Also, for example, if the place has three beasts and you kill two before you die, next time you (or some other player) go back there, there&apos;ll be only one beast left to fight. It&apos;s also possible for two players to run into each other and, once defeating the other, the one who prevails can steal the other player&apos;s money and/or weapons. Thus, searching for the moonstone begins, but that&apos;s only half of the story. The rest unfolds once you find it.</plot>

  <plot>You might be mistaken for thinking that the &quot;treasure hunt in a mansion full of secrets&quot; theme had been played out -- if not in text adventures, then surely in interactive CD-ROMs. And yet here is a text adventure that puts us squarely in that familiar setting, but one which siphons out the worn cliches and tired pretension and shores up the fragile framework with a vigorous injection of healthy, red-blooded absurd fun.One magical Christmas you visit your grandfather&apos;s estate at Attervist Manor, only to discover him mysteriously caught in an unwakeable slumber, suspiciously bearing a letter from the solicitors of the sinister dentist who lives next door regarding his purchase of Grandad&apos;s estate. You will travel the length and breadth of this estate in search of a cure to your grandfather&apos;s condition and buried treasure to ensure the estate&apos;s financial independence.But that&apos;s not what this game is about: it&apos;s about the particle accelerator in the bedroom and the Viking longboat stuck in the pond ice; it&apos;s about the clockwork shark (Grandad&apos;s contribution to the war effort) baking goodies in the kitchen; it&apos;s about needing the gloves so you can pick up the hedgehog. No, these don&apos;t make sense -- but as games are about fun we can overlook that and hide it beneath the Groucho Marx-glasses of &quot;whimsy.</plot>

The marketplace is the only area in the whole of Eriosthe which provides services such as a Shop to purchase and sell weapons, items and food, a Forge to repair weapons, a Hospice to heal wounds and cure diseases, a Mausoleum where your dead can resurrected or laid to rest (removing dead members), a Guild to meet and replace (if needed) dead companions with new recruits and a teleportation portal, which links to other portals (such as those in Sanctuaries) and other areas. The Marketplace also links to Temples and the Magic Circle, which allows your Priest and Magician to advance (by obtaining rings of power). There are also rumors that a sage provides services in identifying objects somewhere deeper in the Eastern tunnels...Adventuring in Eriosthe consists of exploring its caverns and defeating randomly encountered (or pre-set) monsters. An auto-map feature is also available, as well as a directional compass to help you guide your way. Certain encounters, such as puzzles may prompt the player to choose various options in handling the situation, each choice with a possible different outcome.Turn-based combat occurs automatically when the party meets opponents while adventuring (indicated by a sudden picture of the opponent). Fighters and Paladins take the offensive role, while Priests and Magicians (usually) take the support role of casting spells, summoning elementals, and invoking the gods. Surviving combat may uncover money and items. The Dark Heart of Uukrul has no sound or music.</plot>

  <plot>In Star Fleet I: The War Begins, you are a cadet fresh out of Starfleet Academy and have assigned to command your first U.G.A.S. Starship! The Federation is currently at war with Krellans and Zaldrons, so choose your first ship from the Federation starport and prepare for your first mission!The graphics of the PC version of Star Fleet I: The War Begins are represented by ASCII characters. Everything from your starship, the mainframe to torpedoes are all ASCII characters. GameplayGameplay consists of fulfilling the target number enemy kills mentioned in the mission briefing in a specified amount of time. Higher levels demands more kills and less time requirements. Gameplay consists of 2 major areas:1. Main Computer and NavigationYour starship is equipped with state of the art navigation equipment. The main screen displays your main visual display, consisting of the main star chart map, your current position and visual displays. Other sections/information of the starship maybe accessed through the appropriate buttons.Navigation may be conducted automatically or manually. Standard navigation (automatically) is conducted by accessing the main computer and setting out a course. Higher levels may result on random events during navigation (such as electrical storms, running into asteroids or enemy ships). Each map is randomly generated and also uncharted. Each quadrant is represented by numbers, where each number refers to: Stars, Starbases and number of enemy ships. Your starship is also equipped with long-ranged sensors to view adjacent quadrants an well as short-ranged sensors to view your current surroundings. For even further exploration, your starship also has probes to scan far-away quadrants. Combat: Starships, Starbases, and MarinesCombat is the essence of gameplay in Star Fleet I: The War Begins. Entities in a combat situation may consist of the following: Your starship, enemy Krellan starships (max 5 per quadrant), enemy cloaked Zaldron starships (usually one per quadrant), allied Starbase and Space Marines.Combat initiates when your starship enters a hostile quadrant (portrayed by a red number on the main map), usually patrolled by a minimum of 1 (one) Krellan starship. Red Alert is automatically set (unless configured otherwise) resulting the rising of shields and direct attack by enemy starships. Enemy starships are either Krellan starships or the Zaldron cloaked. Krellan starships fire only phasors to soften up your shields. Although your starship is greatly over-matched compared to a single Krellan starship, numerous enemy ships will prove very dangerous. Zaldron starships are unique as they have the ability to cloak (invisible on the both map screens). Zaldrons also use phasers as their main weapon.This type of combat consists of either eliminating all hostiles in the present quadrant (by destroying the enemy ships) or by capturing those ships (and optionally delivering them to a starbase). Your main arsenal consist of Phaser, Torpedoes and Mines. Torpedoes are reserved for direct destruction of enemy vessels. Phasers are usually reserved for the intent of disabling an enemy vessel for capturing purposes. Mines are used to damage enemy vessels that have the bad habit of moving around when eluding your torpedoes.Capturing enemy vessels may only be conducted when the enemy vessel is disabled (by phasers or other means). Space Marines then must board the adjacent ship and automatic combat occurs between your space marines and the enemy crew. If successful, the enemy ship will be captured as well as some power reserves and enemy prisoners. Be warned that enemy prisoners or enemy spies may board your ship without your knowing and damage your ships systems (indicated by &quot;Intruder Alert&quot;). The enemy ship may then be towed to be transported to a Starbase.If enemies prove to much for you and your heavily damaged ship, you can opt for &quot;Self-Destruction&quot;. Be warned, you will survive but it may hamper your mission score greatly.Unique combat situations refer to &quot;Starbase Under Attack&quot; where an allied Starbase is under attack by enemy starships, requiring your immediate attention for rescue.After successfully completing a mission, your mission success is rated: Number of enemies destroyed, captured, starbases rescued, etc. You will then be considered for a promotion or a commendation for a medal!</plot>

  <plot>During the span of history, there have been many great strategists that have lead their troops to victory. The greatest of these are known as Battle Lords and are respected greatly. In a tournament to discover the greatest of these battle lords, great warriors have been pulled out from different eras and available to be controlled by the strategists. The Battle Lords will make their champions fight 1 on 1 amongst themselves to find out who can triumph over all others and obtain the highest ranking. The Battle Lord who can master his will over different warriors will become the Ruler of the Battle Lords.Battle Wrath is a side-scrolling fighting game. The player starts by naming their Battle Lord and then choosing to duel with an enemy battle lord (either computer or another player) in a sanctioned (adjacent rank) or unsanctioned (very different rankings) fight. Each Battle Lord then chooses a character from amongst the available 8 different warriors. These characters then appear in an arena and must deplete each other&apos;s energy. The player has two attack buttons, one for arms (punches) and one for legs (kicks), which can be used with the directional keys to perform a variety of moves. If the enemy is hit a certain way, decapitation can occur (though this can be disabled as &quot;PG Mode&quot; in the options), which limits the attacks available from that player. Each character also has a unique &quot;special move&quot;, which deplete power gems. These power gems can be gathered by having the character stand still and charge up. Each character also has a &quot;Battle Wrath&quot; special move which can only be used when the Battle Lord is ranked #1 (and therefore is the Ruler), likewise better ranking enhances the normal character abilities.</plot>

Fortunately the magician Kafkar knows a promising young apprentice who may stand up to Vissuluth.

It&apos;s an action game with some elements from other genres thrown into the mix. The biggest part of the gameplay is FPS action. You fly around on your magic carpet, clearing levels by killing monsters and battling other wizards. Instead of guns, you use offensive spells like fireball, meteor, lightning, tornado etc.Every monster you kill leaves behind a certain amount of mana which you can possess and store in your castle. You need this mana to cast spells and if you store it in your castle other wizards can&apos;t steal it (in some levels you need to defend your castle from attacks by monsters and rival wizards). With enough mana you can upgrade your castle which allows you to cast more powerful spells. During the course of the game you&apos;ll get all kinds of new spells and improve the ones you already have.Like many other games by Bullfrog Magic Carpet 2 is also a bit of a god game. Many realms are inhabited by neutral citizens; you can help them by destroying monsters that attack them or destroy their cities yourself.

  <plot>Duke Nukem II is a platform game, featuring the famous, muscled hero Duke Nukem. While giving an interview on TV he is captured by the evil Rigelatins, who intend to use his brain for conquering Earth. Duke easily escapes his prison cell. Now he has to make his way through four episodes, each one consisting of an assortment of levels with varying graphic design. On his way, Duke has to destroy lots of obstacles and enemies - both Rigelatin forces and apparent local wildlife. Initially, Duke has just a weak laser rifle, but he can also find a flamethrower (which allows you to shoot down to launch yourself), a rocket launcher or a far more powerful laser cannon. Unfortunately, these stronger weapons have limited ammo. There are also lots of items to collect: health items such as soda cans or atom power-ups, Duke Nukem merchandise which gives score, keys and access cards that let you pass through locked door or electrical barriers. You can also find a rapid fire power-up which lets you shoot faster, a cloaking device which allows you to go through forcefields and a globe which will give you a hint, if you manage to bring it to a pedestal. A lot of items are hidden in boxes of various colors which have to be opened by shooting. Beware, as some boxes do not contain items, but rather a harmful bomb! On some levels, Duke can find a small spaceship. He can enter it and fly around the level, using the ship&apos;s powerful cannon to mow down everything in his way. However, the ship won&apos;t fit everywhere, so Duke will have to get out of it eventually.</plot>

Your quest is to explore the city, and find the clues that will lead you to your captors and help you get back home. In addition to standard first-person RPG&apos;s of that era, like skills, stats, experience points and a repertoire of shops and places to visit, the game offered moral evaluation of your character, and depending on your actions you would be good or evil, and that affected how the environment reacted to you.

Through the gates new souls arrive regularly which were sinful or virtues in one specific aspect. These go to the appropriate zones to receive their gifts or punishment - but only if the player constructed a street system. If there is no place left they wander through hell/heaven which is of course bad for business. After some time they get sent back to the home planet. These souls are the source of the player&apos;s income. Of course these facilities also need personnel. These can be either hired or trained by building special training facilities. There are also additional things the player has to keep in mind, e.g. the satisfaction of each soul and the energy supply. Every buildings has to be micro-managed by adjusting their settings but there is also the possibility to use a tool which does it automatically - for a price. Random disasters like &quot;Birds of Paradise&quot; (excrement rain down on the facilities) break the economic circle and challenge the player to repair the damage.

  <plot>Hind is a simulation of the Soviet Mi-24 helicopter (codenamed &quot;Hind&quot; by NATO and nicknamed &quot;Flying Tank&quot; by Soviet troops), and the followup to Apache. It features the most of the same options, including the ability to change between realistic or more arcade-ish controls by reducing roll, adding unlimited ammo or make the Hind indestructible. Gameplay was changed to fit the differences between the fast and maneuverable Apache and the slow and rock-solid Hind - Instead of relying on speed, Hind pilots must be prepared to take all openings possible to attack and focus on avoiding missile fire (as the hull can take machine gun and even cannon rounds happily). Several viewpoints are available, from pilot or gunner to several external views.There are three campaigns, Kazakhstan (where you face a similarly-equipped enemy, pro-independence rebels), Afghanistan (the Mujaheddin, mostly foot soldiers armed with machine guns, rockets and the odd AAA but in a very hilly terrain) and Korea, where you can skirmish against American equipment. Campaign missions range from fixed target destruction (such as a bunker or a fuel depot), troop deployment (or evacuation), attack enemy positions or even lasing a target for the MiGs. There are day, night and foggy missions, where you have to rely just on instruments for navigation, making pre-mission planning (you can edit the flight plan to include more waypoints, or move them to go round or over a mountain, for instance) more important. Each campaign include 10 scenarios that can be played by their own, along several training missions (which are crucial to get the most of the helicopter). Netplay is included, and given the similarities between Hind and Apache, owners of each game can go head to head together.</plot>

  <plot>Dracula Unleashed is an interactive movie in the same vein as Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective. Basically, you can choose from several locations to go to, and at each location you are shown different events through live-action video clips. Clues in the videos will point you to where you should go next. You also have an &quot;inventory&quot; which you can use to affect the outcome of certain clips (for example, if you enter an asylum with the blackjack you&apos;ll be able to defend yourself against any escaped inmates, but if you don&apos;t bring the blackjack with you you&apos;ll be killed). Time is constantly moving and new events will pop up at different times of the day.In Dracula Unleashed it is the year 1899, ten years after the destruction of count Dracula chronicled in Bram Stoker&apos;s novel. You take the role of Alexander Morris, the younger brother of Texan Quincey Morris who died defeating Dracula. Alexander has come to London to investigate the circumstances of his brother&apos;s death, but became sidetracked when he fell in love with and proposed to a local girl named Annisette.Now, the dawn of a new millennium approaches and an evil force is stalking the streets of London, draining victims of their blood and transforming innocent women into bloodthirsty vampiresses. With the aide of your brother&apos;s old friends, the survivors of Dracula&apos;s evil, you must uncover the identity of this new vampire and prevent him from transforming Annisette into his queen of the night. Do not fail her, or she will personally rip your throat out.</plot>

  <plot>In the year 2104, the Solar Union (the government of Earth and the solar system) faces trouble from three former colonies. Under the guise of negotiations, the colonies&apos; forces attack and capture three mining worlds: Neptune&apos;s moon Triton, the Earth-like planet Romulous and the water world Pacifica. Earth&apos;s survival is at stake. It is the player&apos;s mission to strike back at the invaders and recapture the three worlds. Earth&apos;s full arsenal of ground, air and naval forces is standing by.This version of Nectaris is an updated and expanded version of the original game with a new background story, an entirely different graphical style and lots of new content. It includes all maps (the setting of which has been changed from the Earth&apos;s moon to Triton) and units from the original game. Two new sets of maps (the Romulous and Pacifica campaigns) have been added for a total of 96 levels. There are also many new units, more than doubling the number of the original. The non-lunar settings of the new campaigns allow for naval units for the first time (including submarines and ship-based aircraft), as well as such units as helicopters, jump-jet infantry and paratroopers.Gameplay is unchanged from the original. Units move and attack in turns on a tactical map. Each unit has different ratings for attack and defense as well as range. Combat is decided by various factors including the combatants&apos; abilities, troop strength and experience, terrain, and the positioning of support units.Units cannot be created. The only way to gain new units is to capture depots containing neutral units.To win each map, either the enemy&apos;s headquarters must be captured or all his forces be destroyed.At any time between battles, the campaign can be switched among the three different worlds. The last mission beat on each world is automatically saved, and earlier maps can be accessed through passwords. It is also possible to save the game during a battle.In addition to the single player maps, there are also 8 special multiplayer maps, which can be played by up to four players (or AIs, if not enough people are available). In multi-player mode, various diplomatic relations can be set between the different parties, from alliances to all-out war.</plot>

  <plot>Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called &quot;worlds&quot;; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to &quot;restore the equilibrium&quot; within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level. To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it &quot;yours&quot;. To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect &quot;your&quot; mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won&apos;t be able to hold much mana, so you&apos;ll have to keep casting the &quot;castle&quot; spell at it to make it bigger. The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors. There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though. Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time.</plot>

To celebrate the defeat of the Guardian, Lord British invites the Avatar and his companions to his castle. However, in the night of the feast the Guardian attacks again, encasing the castle in a giant gem of blackrock. Deep in the sewers of the castle, another blackrock gem is found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a teleporter to other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now you, the Avatar, must travel to these worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian&apos;s spell.This sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with its 3D world, action-oriented combat, and magic and dialogue systems. The storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world, a totally alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void. Graphics and sound have also been improved: the size of the viewing window has been increased, there are all-new monster graphics and the game now features digitized sound effects.</plot>

  <plot>Hard Drivin&apos; is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is &quot;reset&quot; and you get up to speed again. The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</plot>

  <plot>KrisalisÆ fourth licensed Manchester United game û the title refers to their success in winning both the Premier League and the FA Cup in the same (93-94) season û- something only six clubs have achieved.The gameplay is overhead view, and has much in common with Kick Off, offering loose control, a range of moves, and an emphasis on short passing. ItÆs not easy at first, but persistence reaps rewards, especially with a two-button controller.Making life easier is the Tacti-Grid tactics editor, which allowed you to customise tactics by instructing players on exactly where they go when the ball is in a particular position. The editor is the most comprehensive ever seen in an action football game, allowing you to rename players, change their appearance and skills, transfer them across clubs, move clubs around the divisions, change their kits, and more.</plot>

You are in charge of the air traffic in a certain sector, making sure that every airplane gets to his destination safely. Your main screen is a radar, which features the aircrafts as green dots or little airplanes, moving at a certain speed at a certain height. The game is a full-talkie, featuring pilot&apos;s voices and those of the ATCs. Interestingly Tracon doesn&apos;t use a sound card for that. The voice acting is done over the PC internal speaker.The more traffic is in the air, the more hectic your job becomes. You have to set routes for the planes and organize punctual arrivals. The game is also featuring emergencies, to make your task more difficult. It is possible to connect the game to a Microsoft Flight Simulator installation on another computer.Tracon was used to train professional ATCs in the early nineties. Then Wesson decided to develop special simulation units for professional users and continue the Tracon series as entertainment.</plot>

  <plot>Brutal Deluxe doesn&apos;t live up to their name - in fact they&apos;re the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 &apos;legs&apos; with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are &apos;portals&apos; which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team&apos;s power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</plot>

Things are starting look good until a strange portal opened in the sky... And UFOs emerged from it... XCOM is needed again... Hire recruits, buy weapons and equipment, outfit your squads in the vehicles. Engage the UFOs in the Cityscape, then go into Battlescape and engage the individual aliens that managed to escape. Research captured equipment and aliens, and hopefully figure out the cause of all this and end the alien threat to Mega-Primus once and for all...XCOM:Apocalypse is a real-time / turn-based tactical combat game that features a unique mix of research, resource management, macro tactical combat, and micro tactical combat. At the city screen, you control your vehicles to engage the threats (everything from rival factions to alien UFOs). If a UFO has landed or infiltration has been reported, your vehicles and land/dock at the infestation site and engage in tactical combat with the equipment at hand. Once you&apos;ve captured aliens and alien equipment, the scientists can research them and perhaps copy them for your use. You&apos;ll also need to balance the budget as everything cost money, from agents to equipment... Also keep the various human factions happy or they may attack you... XCOM:APOC is the &quot;true&quot; sequel to XCOM, designed by Mythos Games. The graphics are reworked, the maps are larger, the world is more complex, and now you get to choose between real-time or turn-based tactical combat.

Other than that the gameplay is pretty much the same as in Ultima I, with your single character roaming the land fighting monsters and looking for key items.In the original Ultima a hero from a certain third rate blue planet orbiting an insignificant yellow sun came to the world of Sosaria and slew the evil wizard Mondain before he could fulfill his dreams of universal domination. Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the people of all time. Unfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero&apos;s homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.</plot>

The player controls a single character giving orders to the others, with his statistics improving as the game progresses.True to the danger of Vietnam, you can run into traps like tripwire, panji stake pits, and more. As point man, you&apos;ll need to &quot;mark&quot; those so the follow-up don&apos;t run into the trap.Seal Team is one of the few games in which you get to see the &quot;riverine&quot; attack boats, including the Swift and PBR&apos;s. Sometimes they serve as infiltration and extraction vehicles, other times as fire support.To simplify gameplay, civilians and VC wear different colors of &quot;pajamas&quot;. VC gets black, civilian gets purple. This makes target ID much easier.</plot>

  <plot>The sequel to the popular RPG Bard&apos;s Tale. After your characters defeated the wizard Mangar the Dark and freed Skara Brae from eternal winter, all seemed well in the world. Fortunately for your employment prospects, the evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta shows up and splits the Destiny Wand into seven pieces, scattering them all over the land. The Destiny Wand has protected the lands for 700 years, and without it the realm will fall into chaos. Thus it falls upon your party to reforge the Destiny Wand. Also, one among you must ascend to the position of Archmage and use the wand to defeat Lagoth Zanta.Bard&apos;s Tale 2 uses the same engine as the original with similar gameplay, but takes place in a much larger game world, featuring several different cities (instead of just Skara Brae). You can generate new characters or import characters from the previous Bard&apos;s Tale.</plot>

While the crates don&apos;t necessarily have set destinations, there is a limited number of valid positions for them to occupy and leave the level still solvable, making this in some thematic senses a platformer variant of Soko-Ban.But protagonist Demolisher Dirk, no doubt rockin&apos; out to Bachman-Turner Overdrive in his Walkman, needs to do more than schlep a bunch of boxes around an empty room; there are hazards to be avoided (electricity arcs, eek!), switches to flip (altering level lay-outs) and a plethora of power-ups allowing him to jump higher and bash or blast through certain kinds of pesky wall.</plot>

Some levels are hidden, and can only be accessed through a secret exit. After the end of 6 levels, you must face a boss.You begin your adventure by choosing the difficulty level you want to play (easy, normal, and hard). The difficulty level will affect how much treasure you must find in the level. If you exit the level earlier than finding the percentage needed, you have to replay the level, as long as you not succeed in finding enough treasure. In easy you must find 55%, in normal it&apos;s 65%, and in hard it&apos;s 75% of all coins &amp; diamonds in the game. Some are visible, some are hidden.In a level, you have no weapons to defeat an enemy. However, you can jump on top of them, or using a shield to defeat them. Charlie has both health and lives, if you get hit by an enemy, you loose one of your hearts (the health). If you loose all of them, you loose a life. If you jump or fall on top of spikes, you immediately die. The initial number of hearts depends on the difficulty.Charlie can not only run and jump, he can only dive. This is needed to find hidden areas in the level.On his adventure, Charlie can find a lot of Power-Ups, mostly hidden in crates, which shatters if you jump on top of them.The following Power-Ups can you find: Heart (will increase Charlie&apos;s health by filling up hearts), Super Heart (will give an extra heart; means when you had 2, you now have 3), Egg (will provide Charlie with an extra life), Letters (there are an A, a C, an E, a H, an I, a L, and a R in a level; if you find them, they will form his name and when you will have them all, you get an extra life), Shield (will make Charlie invulnerable for a moment).</plot>

  <plot>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character&apos;s abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ&apos;s basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, PepΘ Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that&apos;s similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</plot>

  <plot>The Ultimate Tapan Kaikki (Translates roughly to The Ultimate I&apos;ll Kill Everyone) is a simple top-down shooter. The goal of the game is, as the title suggests, to kill everyone on the map by using weapons either picked up from the map or bought from stores. That sounds simple, but it isn&apos;t as easy as one might think, as the enemies are numerous and stimpacks are scarce.The game comes with two episodes and ability to create more on your own with a simple level-editor.</plot>

  <plot>Commander Keen 6: The Armageddon Machine is a platform game, the sixth in the Commander Keen series as a whole.Molly, the babysitter of Billy &quot;Commander Keen&quot; Blaze (an eight-year-old genius) has been kidnapped by the Bloogs from the planet Fribbulus Xax, for purely gastronomical purposes. Keen must set out to Fribbulus Xax to save her!The game begins with a top-down map of the Fribbulus Xax. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter, though some places on the map require you to find specific items (such as a grappling hook) to get through. On each level, you have to make your way to the exit. Once you finish the level, you&apos;re back on the overhead map. The levels are full of enemies, including the club-wielding Blooguards, the Flects which can reflect your shots with their teeth, and Nospikes which charge at you in hopes of impaling you. There are also many deadly hazards. If Keen gets shot or touched by an enemy, or falls into a pit or touches something hazardous, he dies, and you lose one life. Thankfully, Keen can stun most enemies with his raygun. He also carries a pogo stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include: ammo, gems that are needed to open locked doors, bonus items which give score, bird-like &quot;Vivas&quot; (100 of them give an extra life) and the rare Queen Viva which gives an extra life.</plot>

  <plot>Chess and destructive laser beams together at last! Laser Chess, which is a DOS version of the award winning original, for the most part plays like a regular chess game except that some pieces have been replaced by deflectors and a laser cannon. You move your pieces on the board as usual but have to place your deflectors in strategic positions all the while keeping an eye on your opponent doing the same thing during their turn. Turns are used up when you move a piece, rotate a piece or fire the laser. Once you feel a deflector is in the right place, unleash your laser and shoot the opposing players. Be careful though, because some pieces if rotated in the wrong direction will bounce the beam or split it in wrong directions and even worse can even bounce back at your laser cannon destroying it. Check mate means the game is done.</plot>

  <plot>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall&apos;s job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn&apos;t bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor&apos;s hammer, Odin&apos;s sword and Frey&apos;s spear in three worlds. You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these worlds to collect the god&apos;s weapons.The first is Midgard (or Earth), the second is Utgard (the world of the giants) and the third is Asgard itself, the home of the gods. Each world has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.When you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall&apos;s stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don&apos;t do well then you won&apos;t get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.The first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).Once you&apos;ve done this it&apos;s time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god&apos;s missing weapons.</plot>

  <plot>The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed &quot;Material Defender&quot;, to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that&apos;s more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship&apos;s energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine&apos;s reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player&apos;s strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.</plot>

  <plot>Deluxe Ski Jump is a shareware ski jumping simulation with full 3D graphics and excellently modelled real world physics. The game contains 32 different hills, which vary in size from the tiny K50 in England to the huge K250 in Slovenia. DSJ also allows for up to 16 players (computer or human controlled) to compete for the World Cup trophy simultaneously, using the same computer. The actual jumping is performed using the mouse buttons (for jumping and landing) and by moving the mouse up and down (to angle your jumper in flight). This system works quite well, though it takes practice to master.There are several factors that affect the outcome of a jump, of which the most important is timing. A poorly timed &quot;take off&quot; will most likely drag you down and force you to land prematurely. Other factors include wind strenght and direction as well as a certain knowledge of the hill you&apos;re jumping.</plot>

Locate and return Mjollnir to Thor;3. Locate and return Gjall to Heimdall;4. Locate and return Mimming to Freyr;5. Locate and return Gundnir to Odin6. Find a manner for Tyr to fight with one arm.*Further details of each quest are presented within the game (options) as well as hints on how to accomplish them.Valhalla offers 6 classes to choose from. However, these classes are not permanent in effect. After every 10th level, you may choose to switch to other classes for maximum affects, as most skills and powers of each class are usually achieved at the 10th level. The classes you may choose from are (in no particular order):1. The VikingThe Viking is the &quot;Fighter Class&quot; in Valhalla. Being the strongest class in the beginning of the game, the Viking at higher levels may achieve the status of a Weapons Master and learn second attacks.2. The BlacksmithThe Blacksmith is one of the most respected classes in Valhalla, able to forge weapons and armor, the Blacksmith is the very soul of adventuring. A master Blacksmiths may learn to forge his/her own weapons and armor.3. The WoodsmanThe Woodsman is the &quot;Ranger Class&quot; of Valhalla.

The ConjurerThe Conjurer is the &quot;Mage Class&quot; of Valhalla. There are 5 available spells available for casting. Buy the 10th level, all five will be in the disposal of the Conjurer. The Master Conjurer may also learn the skill to teleport. Each class has their primary skill and power (if any) as some stated above. However certain magical items or events may grant the character skills and powers previously not available to that class, either permanently or temporary. The world of Valhalla itself is divided into 3 realms. There are also 5 minor planes and countless other areas outside the boundaries of space and time. Each realm has its own unique terrain and set of monsters. The main three realms are:Midgaard û Land of Mortals;7. Asgard û Land of Gods;8. Niflheim û Land of the Dead.One in particular is the random world feature. Each new game in Valhalla is completely unique, including shopkeeper locations and the items sold, making Valhalla as a whole, a completely repeatable game.</plot>

  <plot>Starting as a young Roman legionnaire in 275BC, your job is to conquer the known world through force or diplomacy, fighting on land and sea. Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let&apos;s just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province. When you enter a province you don&apos;t yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn&apos;t very likely, and you&apos;ll often have to fight. When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander&apos;s voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat. Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.</plot>

  <plot>Inspired by the famous 1986 film, Top Gun: Danger Zone is a desert dogfighting air combat simulation set on board an aircraft carrier (the USS Brigham) patrolling the waters off Libya and the Middle East. You have a choice of two aircraft - the F-14 Tomcat (in which you also get a Radar Intercept officer to assist you) and an F-18 Hornet (where you&apos;ll fly solo). The choice of missions is limited to eight - intercept, escort, clear airspace, provide air support and run interference. However, you also get to participate in the &quot;Top Gun Challenge Board&quot; in the Officer&apos;s Mess, where you challenge 12 other fellow pilots in simulated one-to-one dogfights to practice your skills, get their respect and increase your ranking. You also have a choice of playing against the CPU or against another human player in split-screen mode. The flight model is not completely realistic - but it is not ridiculous, as in many other games (even today). The game aims to have an arcade-style simplicity for the flying, and adds character development similar to many RPGs.</plot>

Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don&apos;t let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</plot>

The game starts with the player subscribing to a dating agency called &quot;Man Enough&quot;, run by a woman named Jeri. She assists by popping up on the screen to give hints and evaluate progress. After that, the game goes to a gym where Blair, Erin, Fawn, Kellie and Quinn are. They can be clicked with a cursor in the shape of a human face: it changes to one with a speech balloon when placed over their heads (to initiate dialog and the dating progress), and to one with bulging eyes when placed on their bodies (to play a short &quot;sexy&quot; video of the girl).The game manual comes with profiles for each girl, listing their predilections and dislikes. Using that information, the player must choose between three answers to each question made. These questions are displayed over a picture of the girl that changes according to her mood. Wrong answers bring sullen looks, and right answers bring broad smiles.Jeri appears regularly to evaluate and encourage the player. Success moves the game forward to another stage, where the whole process is repeated again. Sometimes there is a change of pace with a mini-game (in the case of Quinn, after the second conversation the player has to win on a game of paintball against her).

If this game is called a simulator it&apos;s because: your shots will be different depending on the net distance, the effect and direction of the ball in serve will be defined by you, besides, you will have a total control of the ball direction, shot power and shot style on the moment of the impact (according to the pressed keys), you will be able to access to game stats on every moment, and finally, you will have the possibility of choosing racket and slippers (all of them adapted for every situation).</plot>

  <plot>Kingdom O&apos; Magic is a fantasy adventure game spoof - along the lines of Zork but with British humour. Play as either an unintelligible Green Lizard Guy (use subtitles) or the token female - who was intended to be humorously overproportioned although now Tomb Raider has raised the standard.The designers intended for the game to be non-linear, and many NPCs wander around the entire map getting into fights with each other.Entirely comedic - the troubleshooting guide in the manual discusses sexual malfunction. The dialogue trees encourage the player to be abrasive and confrontational - not doing so will cause you to miss out on much of the enjoyment, and many of the puzzles.</plot>

  <plot>Depending on which title you use, and how you interpret it, this game is about a guy who a)rushes in before attacking b)attacks Russians (this was the mid-80s, when the US helped bin Laden do the same), or c)wears a rather goofy hat. One way or another, this arcade conversion arms you with a knife and sends you on a kamikaze mission against hordes of enemy fighters.There are four distinct sections of gameplay, taking in a Missile Base, a Harbour, a Bridge, and an enemy Prison Camp. Extra weapons with limited ammunition can be collected along the way, which will make the task a lot easier. The level is divided into 3 horizontal levels, which can be moved between either by jumping or using ladders, and this gives a chance to avoid the more threatening mobs of enemy fighters</plot>

Her latest project is a spagetti western being filmed in an abandoned western ghost town called Slaughter Gultch, which rests precariously on the edge of the San Andreas fault. Originally a gold town set up rather rudely on ancient Indian sacred ground, Slaughter Gultch was founded by a man named Jebediah Stone and run by his own private army of cold-blooded killers. Stone and his men were killed by angry villagers led by the local Blacksmith, and the town was abandoned soon after. Unfortunately, Emily&apos;s crew disturbs the spirits of Stone and his men, who promptly return to the world of the living and proceed to kill off the film crew one by one. Carnby is called to Slaughter Gultch after learning of the disappearance of Emily and her crew, and is soon met by Stone&apos;s Zombie Cowboy gang. Armed with various western paraphenalia such as colt peacemakers, bullwhips, and even a gattling gun, Carnby must fight his way through Stone&apos;s minions and discover Emily&apos;s fate. Along the way he learns some surprising things about Stone&apos;s origin, as well as a sinister plan interrupted by his death which involved the destruction of the west coast and which Stone can now pursue once again.</plot>

  <plot>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like &quot;a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people. The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as &quot;the Bureau,&quot; has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.Naturally &quot;the Bureau&quot; has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun&apos;s battle walker, called the &quot;Slambird&quot; is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</plot>

  <plot>An intermediary step in complexity between the brutally basic HAMURABI and more sophisticated modern titles such as Civilization, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio ushers you into a Merchant Prince setting, governing over a 15th-century Italian city-state, competing with the savage forces of nature and against up to 5 (7 in some later versions) other players in the hot-seat, seeing who can rise through the ranks to claim titles from COUNT, to MARQUIS, GRAND DUKE (and, finally, H.R.H. KING.)At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population&apos;s food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that&apos;ll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace. However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves. Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies. If, after commissioning them all, you find you don&apos;t have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death. All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you&apos;ve got, while you&apos;ve got it.</plot>

You play the role of an inhabitant of Vault 13. Recently, the water purification controller chip was broken. Without clean water, the people of the Vault cannot survive. You are sent to retrieve a chip from another Vault. And you venture outside, to face a dangerous world and to find your place in it.Fallout is a RPG that utilizes a character development system called S.P.E.C.I.A.L.

You can customize your character&apos;s parameters and skills, making him a strong melee fighter, a computer freak, a charismatic leader, a skillful sniper, and many more. You can specialize in various types of weapons, become proficient in conversations with people, etc. The game world offers a non-linear exploration: you can either follow the main story or perform one of the many sub-quests, visiting the game&apos;s locations in your preferred order. The game utilizes a turn-based combat system. Your party members (if you recruit any) are controlled by the computer AI.

  <plot>One of Sierra&apos;s classic VGA remakes, &quot;Quest for Glory&quot; is a 256-color version of the RPG adventure Hero&apos;s Quest with a brand new interface. It looks like the quiet, fairy-tale-like town of Spielburg could use a hero! The governor&apos;s daughter is missing, there is a gang of dangerous robbers who have their camp somewhere near the town, and the witch Baba Yaga is up to some mischief. You, a lonely adventurer, agree to take the job and to help the people of Spielburg.Although very similar to Sierra&apos;s other &quot;quest&quot; games in perspective and interface (as well as in humor), this is not a pure adventure, but rather a RPG/adventure hybrid. The hero can start as either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. Playing as each one of those classes not only gives you different abilities, but also changes many objectives and puzzles in the game, and influences the plot. Walking in the wilderness areas near Spielburg, you will be attacked by enemies and fight them in real- time combat. Instead of experience points and levels system you gain better stats directly after every fight. You can also train your other skills, such as climbing or throwing, by performing the appropriate actions repeatedly.This remake features VGA graphics (most of the locations and character graphics were completely re-done), and a new, icon-based interface (instead of the text input in the original). You select dialogue choices from a dialogue menu, instead of typing conversation topics by yourself. Combat engine and some dialogues were also re-made.</plot>

  <plot>This German game of dexterity delivers what the title promises. Balance is a lesson in applied gravity: guide a ball to one or more targets by tilting the plane it sits on, much like in those little plastic toys that drive you insane. A simple premise made challenging by tricky, maze-like level layouts that go beyond the &quot;A to B&quot; routine, but require you to touch a certain number of target tiles in no particular order. You must reach all targets in limited time, or else you have to start over. If the ball falls off the edge, one of ten lives is lost. Special fields such as jumpers, accelerators or crumbling tiles test your reflexes; some levels even rotate.Balance uses vector graphics to draw flat, untextured fields on which the ball rolls. The plane is tilted with the mouse. Every few levels, you get a password to jump directly to that map. Even so, Balance is extremely difficult and only recommended for players with *a lot* of patience.</plot>

  <plot>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</plot>

The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave...Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they&apos;ll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</plot>

We are expert in punches, we handle the sabre with ferocity and make the flexible lance more penetrating and versatile. And all thanks to the Chi. As first action, we will have the possibility of training with the Dummies (the wood men), where we will practice the distance, the speed and the use of complementary techniques. From which we will get up ourselves into the dynamics of the fight and the confrontations hand-to-hand with the partisans of the evildoer.The movements are varied, all of them based on the Fung-Fu techniques.

  <plot>(From Infocom Home Page site)After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details!

  <plot>In its dark mansion the Hogbear awaits its next victim. Guarded by a Vampire, an Ogre, and various other creatures, the player will have to roam the many rooms of the estate and hope to escape with your life. Hopefully you can locate some weapons and use them in fighting these guarding monsters and ultimately Hogbear itself.Hogbear is an updated version of Castle Adventure wherein the game uses part graphic and part text commands to explore, loot and battle in order to escape from the castle. The game, though graphical, uses a lot of ASCII to visualize its graphics. The tone of the game is humorous but with a mean streak personified through the narrative which seems to have been written by the game&apos;s antagonist Hogbear himself.Combating the monsters involves moving into them with a selected weapon ranging from bladed weapons to dead chickens. This precursor to what is now labeled &quot;survival horror&quot; games has graphics (though marketed as an update of Castle Adventure, has little graphical difference from that game except for the use of colour) but needs text input for commands. Thankfully moving utilizes the cursor keys meaning the player can literally move themselves around the rooms and from room to room. In order to interact with objects such as picking them up you will need to be in close proximity.</plot>

The maniacal Baron Czarny wants to take over what&apos;s left of the country; you must stop him.The player must organize a team of 20 generated soldiers, each of whom will respond to orders differently, based on their personality. Specific abilities, attributes and languages spoken can be set. Action from within the vehicles is shown in 3D, outside action is viewed top-down. Both aspects of the game require meticulous planning around the game&apos;s range of weapons and vehicles. Help can be received from NPCs, via the game&apos;s communication system.</plot>

  <plot>CHAMP Galagon is a DOS shareware remake of Namco&apos;s classic 1980 Galaga arcade shooter. Like the other games in CHAMProgramming&apos;s series of arcade remakes, it closely emulates the original with two game modes, the original &quot;Classic&quot; and the enhanced &quot;Champ&quot; mode.The &quot;Classic&quot; mode plays and feels like the arcade machine, with very similar graphics, sound and gameplay: You play a spaceship, moving horizontally at the bottom of the screen, and shooting up at a bunch of Space Invaders-like aliens, which attack you in waves becoming harder and harder with the game. Every third level is a bonus round, where you may shoot at will for extra points.The &quot;Champ&quot; mode is an upgraded version of the classic game, featuring new graphics and gameplay elements. For example, you can increase your firepower by rescuing former comrades captured in enemy formations. There also is a new device called G-Bomb, used by the alien flagships, which you can get by destroying him and use against the enemy.Finally, the game features a variety of options -- one or two player modes, three difficulty settings, adjustable game speed, input by keyboard, mouse or joystick (Champ even released a &quot;Champ cable&quot; that allowed you to play the game with digital joysticks), and a high score table to round it all off.</plot>

  <plot>A futuristic racing game with hover cars, in the same line as Wipeout, using a modified version of the Magic Carpet 2 engine.Gameplay takes a straightforward approach, with the directional keys controlling the steering and throttle, and three keys to fire the minigun, missiles or charge the booster. While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground material: they slow down on dirt and even more on water. Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly.Includes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking control of the players&apos; vehicles waiting for their turn. There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race. There are Eight teams to choose from, which change the colour of the vehicle: Mad Medicine (white), Bullfrog (aqua green), Storm Riders (purple), Fire Phreaks (orange), DethFest (blue), Foo Fighters (yellow), Gorehounds (red) and Assassins Anonymous (black).</plot>

  <plot>The Incredible Hulk is an isometric 3D action game.The popular Marvel comic book hero The Hulk returns to the PC, Playstation and Saturn systems to battle tons of lowly enemies and the occasional monstrous super-villain. When the lawful Pantheon society of superheroes kidnaps the green giant, he joins forces with his abductors and smashes through 13+2 isometric 3D levels (in a look reminiscent of the Loaded series of games).True to the comic books, the Hulk relies on no other weapons than his massive muscles to punch, kick and crush his enemies. When he has accumulated enough gamma energy, he may use powerful special moves like a Vortex Spin or the Floor Hammer. Rare bonus items also allow the Hulk to summon one of the four Pantheon team members Atalanta, Ulysses, Ajax and Hector to assist in the thick of battle. Most levels include at least one arch-enemy, such as Piecemeal, Trauma &amp; Lazarus or the U-Foes. Luckily, the HulkÆs regenerative powers allow him to regain health slowly. Little seems to be left of the HulkÆs legendary leaping capacity, however, so the green meat ball is forced to hop from platform to platform every now and then. You can find more information on The Incredible Hulk comic books in the trivia and links sections.</plot>

  <plot>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can&apos;t shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.</plot>

The levels include a variety of vehicles such as jeeps, tanks and helicopters, which can be used to shoot or even run down enemy soldiers.

  <plot>Space Battles contains four different games on one disk:1. Space War: An action game for two players or one player against the computer. In the game two spaceships attempt to be the first to deplete their opponents shield. Each ship is equipped with phasers and photon torpedoes as well as the ability to enable a cloaking device and instantly warp to a new location. However using the ships abilities drains energy. The game is played similar to Asteroids: each ship can thrust forward and rotate left or right to maneuver.2. Meteor Shower: In this game numerous meteors are falling! Your goal is to guide your character and collect as many of the pieces of the scene as you can. When a meteor falls it will remove any pieces of the scene that happen to be in its way causing you to lose points. If you collect a piece before it&apos;s destroyed by a meteor you gain points. If you are hit by a falling meteor then you lose a life. The goal is to earn as many points as possible. One to four players can compete for the highest score.3. Moon Lander: This game is similar to the arcade game Lunar Lander. Controller your lander, your goal is to land on the moon without crashing or running out of fuel. The lander is equipped with various thrusters which you need to carefully fire in order to guide the lander to a safe location and land as gently as possible.4. Space Zombies: In this game your goal is to earn as many points as possible by collecting dots on the screen. Four opponents bounce and wander around the screen; if you get caught a life is lost, and the game ends when all players have lost all their lives. One to four players take turns playing the game and compete for the highest score.</plot>

  <plot>In the future, there is no violence. Instead, people play sports, one of which is Ball Blaster: a one-on-one soccer-like game played in hovercraft. Not exactly like soccer, since in Ball Blaster, the goals move, the arena is oddly shaped, and money earned by making goals can be used to buy weapons or powerups. These allow the player to more easily take the ball from the opponent, as well as protect himself from having the ball taken from him, or otherwise obstruct the opponent.Extra money is earned by winning the matches more quickly, which can be accomplished by making goals from a greater distance--goals ordinarily score one point, but goals from a distance score two. Five points are required to win each match.</plot>

The player controls a space ranger of sorts who&apos;s been sent to Earth&apos;s colony planet, Spore, to investigate a distress signal sent from the now apparently deserted outpost. This barren landscape is navigated according to the standard conventions of homebrew interactive fiction: movement is dictated according to compass points and various inventory items are acquired to employ in the overcoming of small puzzles.Punctuating the landscape, however, are a series of shimmering, radiant pillars made of energy. Entering into them kicks the game into its Mr. Hyde mode, a workmanlike Breakout clone. Events on the text adventure stage are influenced by success at the Breakout levels, and through traversing all 16 pillars, the adventure reaches its conclusion.</plot>

It was famous in Israel for being one of the (very) few Israeli productions ever, and was sold for a brief period in 1993.A direct translation from the manual (in Hebrew):Professor Avish, the top instructor from the university, has been asked to lecture in front of a hall full of people. He was invited to sleep in a hotel in the night before the lecture. When Avish woke up in the morning, while still in his pajamas, he discovered to his amazement that he is not in the hotel, but a spooky castle with many rooms. Avish moved from room to room in the dark castle in order to get back to the hotel and get to the lecture room.When he finally got to the lecture room he was very excited from the adventure, and therefore decided to change the subject of the lecture and tell of what happened to him.Luckily for him, Avish took pictures of all castle rooms with his slide camera, but unfortunately he forgot how he got out of every room. Help Avish find the exit!Avish is essentially a simple platform game where you must avoid obstructions in order to find the key that will open the door to lead you out of the room.</plot>

You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.</plot>

  <plot>Fallen Angel is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Double Dragon. You play the fallen angel, sent on a mission to locate the leader of a drug distribution network. Beginning in the London underground, each level will present you with two tasks to complete: find a plane ticket to reach the next level, and destroy the ring leader of the area. To do this you will need to fight the (often well armed) thugs found in the various underground train stations and on the trains themselves. Each level consists of several stations; when all the thugs in a station are defeated, you may get on the train to go to a different station. The plane ticket you are searching for may be found in any one of these stations, and the level boss will be found in the last station. You are free to complete these two tasks in any order you choose, and don&apos;t need to visit the stations in any particular order. Fallen angel has the ability to perform a variety of kicks and punches to deal with the bad guys, and can occasionally pick up weapons.</plot>

  <plot>The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer edition includes 8 events from athletics to cycling. The events are:1. Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added2. Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow.3. 400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending the event4. High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared.5. Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.6. Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well7. Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling.Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to eight human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from). It&apos;s also possible to replay and even store your best (or worst) moments.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the MegaTraveller table-top science-fiction game, your task in The Zhodani Conspiracy is to prevent war breaking out between the Zhodani Consulate and the Imperium - Zhodani officials have bribed some of their Imperium counterparts to try and bring about a war between the two sides.In this role-playing game character creation is the first task. Characters can be created and then put through a choice of five military careers to gain skills and experience semi-randomly (there are more than 70 talents and abilities), or you can simply compose your squad of five from the pre-defined roster.In total there are 28 planets grouped within 8 solar systems, and there&apos;s not much space free of adventure and mystery. 30 different types of cargo exist for interplanetary trading and bartering. Combat takes place in real-time, you can control any one of your characters while giving orders to the others.</plot>

  <plot>Snarf is a maze-like game. The objective is to finish all levels. A level contains points, keys, doors, teleporters, enemies, powerups and enemy generators. You can shoot the enemies to make free your path, but they will appear again from the generators. When you reach the right end of the level, the level is finished. Some factors comprehend gameplay, however: for instance, you cannot have more than 1 or 2 bullets in the game: you will be able to shoot only when you don&apos;t have the maximum number of bullets currently on the screen. The game has 50 levels, climbing in difficulty from very easy to very difficult. Snarf comes with a level editor to create your own levels: you can also create the graphics for the wall for that level. It also comes with a comprehensive manual.</plot>

The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it&apos;s converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</plot>

  <plot>Hill Street Blues is a top-down action / strategy mix.ôLetÆs be careful out there!öBased on the æ80s TV drama series Hill Street Blues, this game puts you in the role of Captain Furillo of the Hill Street police department. Crime rates are soaring in the precinct, and itÆs up to your team of nine officers (all well-known from the series and with digitized portraits) to keep the streets safe.Your officers move on foot or by car on a 2D top-down map of the city, complete with real-time traffic. True to the series, each day starts with a roll call from Sgt. Esterhaus. Once on duty, listen to radio operator A.J. Hill report crimes every few minutes. Deploy officers to the scene, help the victim and call an ambulance or coroner; next, identify and find the suspect. Some criminals may flee, others even shoot at you. Give chase or open fire if necessary. When the bad guy is arrested, a court trial may follow.Hill Street Blues is controlled entirely with the mouse via a set of icons û thatÆs everything but intuitive, especially when directing a single officer through the streets. Since there will soon be multiple crimes all over the city, the challenge is to co-ordinate multiple officers simultaneously and keep track of cases and suspects. If your success rate is high enough, you will ultimately be promoted to chief of police.</plot>

Many enemies must be shot down along the way, but most release credits when shot û wait a few seconds for these to appear. You have three lives, with each rat representing a life, which means that all upgrades are lost when you lose a life, and each ratÆs protective biosphere has the ability to withstand a few shots.

  <plot>In Transport Tycoon, you are in charge of a transport company starting in 1930 in the midst of The Great Depression, and your aim is to build up an empire of trains, ships, lorries, planes and helicopters, with technological evolution to be taken into account. You can play alone, or with a number of computer-controlled rivals. At the beginning of the game, you (and your rivals) have a large terrain at your disposal. The terrain includes hills, rivers, lakes, bridges, industrial facilities and a lot of small towns. It is up to you to decide how to start building your empire. The game is shown in isometric projection. An icon bar at the top of the screen allows you to bring up the map, see the stats, or construct stuff. Maybe you can begin by connecting two towns with a road, building a vehicle depot somewhere next to the road, and setting up bus stops in both towns. Now just buy a bus (initially, there are just a few models available, but more buses appear with time), set its schedule, and watch as it goes between both bus stops, taking passengers and unloading them, earning you money. You can also transport passengers by building train tracks, sea ports, or airports and then buying appropriate vehicles - trains, ferries, planes. If you set up a station next to an industrial facility (such as a factory, a power plant or a farm), you can also transport various cargo, such as coal, livestock or wood, which allows you to earn much more money than transporting passengers. Of course, you&apos;ll have to buy special lorries and train cars if you&apos;ll want to deal with these. Most businesses offer certain types of cargo and are ready to pay for transporting other cargo to them; for example, a steel mill has a lot of steel to fill your cars, and will gladly accept iron ore if you have any. Clicking on any of your vehicles brings up a small window where you can observe a live feed of what the vehicle is doing and look up its status. If anything important happens during the game (such as a particular station accepting its first vehicle), it is shown as a newspaper headline at the bottom of the screen.</plot>

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</plot>

  <plot>After the split-up with Microsoft, subLOGIC proceeded to create their own concept of what a simple flight simulator should be like. Taking cues from both Microsoft Flight Simulator 3 and Flight Assignment: ATP, Flight offers both free flight and over 200 &quot;flight assignments&quot; for beginner pilot training. Five small aircraft are included: Cessna CitationJet, Beachcraft Bonanza, Cessna 172, Piper Cherokee, and Mooney 201. Scenery includes airports across the entire United States, including four metropolitan regions in detail, plus Montreal and Toronto, Canada. Owners of subLOGIC&apos;s Great Britain Scenery Collection can import it into Flight, but all other subLOGIC Scenery Disks are incompatible. Maps of the metro regions and a navigation table are included in the game box.Flight was originally released in 1994 as Flight Light, which included only the CitationJet and the four metropolitan regions (New York/Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Austin, and Los Angeles/San Diego). The rest of the aircraft and scenery were later included in the 1995 release of Flight Light Plus, which became simply Flight in 1996 after subLOGIC was acquired by Sierra. The game was succeeded by Pro Pilot, developed under Dynamix.</plot>

  <plot>The land of Metavira needs your help! Contract additional mercenaries as you explore, capture, and hold new territory so the natives can harvest the valuable trees from which a revolutionary medicine can be extracted. The more trees you hold, the more money you make. The more money you have, the more you can do, such as hire native guards, hire more mercs, in order to take the offense and clear the sector of enemies. You will also need to retrieve certain objects from behind enemy lines, rescue captured personnel, capture equipment, and more. Hire a good mechanic in order to get your equipment and guns repaired, and to &quot;enhance&quot; them with various add-ons. Travel through lush jungles, treacherous rivers (with venomous snakes!), and more as you seek to free Metavira. Eventually, you&apos;ll meet up with the bad guys&apos; leader in his compound for the final showdown...Jagged Alliance is a turn-based tactical combat game with a mixture of strategy that is very remiscent of XCOM. On the &quot;strategic view&quot;, you get to see the various sectors of Metavira. You start with just one sector, with a few trees for your income. You need to hold more sectors in order to increase the number of trees you hold, which will increase your income. You can hire/fire mercs. Each merc can move or shoot or perform any of the other actions as long as they sitll have action points. Each of the mercenaries have personality. Some work well with others, others won&apos;t. You&apos;ll need shooters (both long and short guns), explosive experts (to set/disarm bombs/traps), mechanics/gunsmiths (fix/modify your equipment), doctors/nurses (to heal wounded mercs). Each merc has a different price, so you&apos;ll need to balance what you can afford vs. what you need. Manage the equipment as well. If you move into an enemy-held sector, the game moves to combat mode, where you get an over-head slightly-isometric turn-based tactical combat that&apos;s based on &quot;action points&quot;, which limits the amount of action each merc can perform. You can do this, or that, but not both. The action continues until the sector is no longer contested (either one side got wiped out, or retreated to another sector, or both). After the sector is clear, you can call in native guards to &quot;hold&quot; the sector (you need to pay for them as well) as well as hire more natives to process the &quot;new&quot; trees. You will also need to get the mercs to the homebase if any one was wounded, and let the doctor/nurse treat them. Idle mercs at the base can train to improve their ratings. Some scripted events and some random events will keep you busy such as poisoned water, a virus that attacks the trees, kidnapped daughter of chief, and others. So to summarize, you need to manage the mercs (and their salary), their equipment (who gets what), arrange for backup (mercs at base) and medical treatment (doctor/nurse) while taking into account their personalities and strengths. You also need to manage the strategic aspects as you need to &quot;conquer&quot; each sector and then send enough guards to hold the sector after you retrieve the mercs. You manage the money as you need to balance the expenditures (mercs, equipment, guards, natives, etc.) against the income (the trees). You also get to manage the tactical aspects of the battle as you decide each move and shot. A full complement of mercenary supplies (from revolvers to M-16s, plus bombs, grenades, mines, flak jackets, helmets, and more) are available.</plot>

This LLV simulator exposes moon pilots to the dangers of inaccurate navigation, inefficient fuel consumption, and incorrect maneuvering. If fuel is consumed before the LLV reaches its destination, the craft will either crash into the lunar surface or orbit the Moon &quot;forever.The cockpit window presents the lunar landscape from the pilot&apos;s perspective. Solid color 3-D graphics depict important environmental features such as lunar bases, refueling stations, craters, and constellations.The accompanying manual not only describes how to operate the game, but also describes in detail NASA&apos;s hypothetical plans for a space station and lunar mining facility.

Pac-em even has the original&apos;s intermissions between some levels.The &quot;Champ&quot; mode has the same game play, but features some special enhancements like speed ramps, which speed you up for a certain time, or random teleports. Finally, the game features a variety of options -- one or two player modes, three difficulty levels, adjustable game speed, input by keyboard, mouse or joystick (Champ even released a &quot;Champ cable&quot; that allowed you to play the game with digital joysticks), and a high score table to round it all off.</plot>

  <plot>Terminal Terror is the sequel to Lethal Tender. Once again you step in the shoes of super spy/army-of-one hero Nick Hunter and this time around your mission is to take back into custody the international terrorist Bruno Riggs who has escaped jail thanks to the aid of a new terrorist cell that has some nasty plans in store for the world.Gameplay evolves from the straightforward Doom-cloned FPS action of the original and introduces a lot of innovative features that were surprisingly ahead of it&apos;s day for a FPS, such as branching and optional missions, stealth-oriented sequences which make use of non-lethal weapons and a stealth meter (named as the &quot;profile&quot;) which allow you to avoid detection based on your current speed, readied weapon, etc.Combat also incorporates a power bar which depletes the longer you keep firing and adds a primitive but effective hit-detection system which inflicts different types of effects on your character depending on where he is hit (damaged legs slow you down or make your character turn towards a certain direction when moving as if he were limping, damaged arms affect your aim, damaged eyes blur your vision, etc.).The game also incorporates an inventory/equipment bar for item management and throws civilians and allies into the mix, which will turn on you or cost you mission objectives if you shoot them or fail to protect them.</plot>

So the player jumps and fights through seven big side-scrolling levels to conquer them back and rescue their residents. Every level has a different theme like a ghost mansion or a forest. Because the levels are big the game gives marks and tips where to go when reaching a branch. Most of the enemies are dispatched with the badger&apos;s gun which can be upgraded but sometimes there are puzzles to solve, e.g. a locked door needs a certain item to open which has to be found first.

  <plot>Royal Flush is a simulation of the real life pinball machine of the same name by Gottlieb. The main focus lies on a realistic feeling and the ball physics. The game is played with just four buttons: two to handle the two paddles, one to release the balls, and one to simulate the shaking on a real pinball machine. The whole table uses a poker design. There are multiple ways to receive bonus points, e.g. hitting one of the five cards on the upper part, three bumpers or The Hole which gives you a lot of points and lands the ball on the right paddle. Depending on the graphics card there are two ways how the machine is simulated: it is either stationary (you see the hole table at once) or it scrolls with the playing ball.The game features an extensive menu where you can set almost all aspects of the pinball machine, including inclination, number of playing balls and the amount of currency which flows through the paddles.</plot>

  <plot>The military is often painted in terms of precision. Orders are expected to be followed exactly. But what happens when those giving the orders are blind? Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, who have to wait for their men to call in with information. This game puts the player in the shoes of a Corps commanderùa man responsible for several divisionsùfor the lives of thousands of men. The player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader.In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II and the Korean War.Think for a moment about war from the perspective of the Marine. Out in the field, their duty is to carry out orders to the best of their ability. They must try to cope with the unexpected that interferes with their progressùweather, enemies, terrain, fatigue, lack of supplies... Unfortunately, it is a fact that there is a disconnect between soldiers in the field and the commanders in the command centers. Commanders don&apos;t have a personal connection to each person under them. They rely on those underneath them to report in...This game gives some insight to the problems of command. There are hundreds of units to keep track of, and the player needs a way to keep them organized. The units become symbols on a map-board. Contact with the units is limited to the reports that they send back and the orders that the player sends out. Once the orders are given, the situation is really out of your control. Will they be able or willing to follow orders exactly? What happens if they are interrupted by the enemy, by weather, by terrain. Is the information on enemy movements accurate, or did the player just send a division (thousands of men) to their deaths?Most soldiers and Marines have never had the opportunity to see just what goes on inside the command centers, where the orders that they must follow come from. This game recreates the command center.</plot>

  <plot>Utopia takes the Sim City gameplay concept and adds a military element to it. The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</plot>

  <plot>This was the final update to Championship Manager 2, and it was fully debugged and had the AI tidied in in several areas. The team and player data was updated for the 97/98 season, meaning that Michael Owen has emerged at Liverpool and Emmanuel Petit has joined Arsenal, for example. Nine different leagues are included, and up to 3 of these can be played at once on 16 Megabyte machines. As a result of this, more teams and players are included in the game system than ever, making for a more realistic player-signing challenge. A full data editor is included for the first time.</plot>

  <plot>Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe&apos;s Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure.Larry, the game&apos;s protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who&apos;s constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions.</plot>

His task on each level is to pick up boxes of the cereal, add honey and drive the train to the end of the level, where the cargo is loaded into a big box of Guldkorn.It is not just a straight forward career along the tracks, though. Switches must be set back and forth for the train to go on the right tracks, there are rocks and fallen trees on the track, and you must keep your speed so as not to crash into things. Fortunately for Puff the bear, he has a honeybee friend. By tapping the joystick button, you activate the bee. It is the bee&apos;s task to activate the switches and to operate the honey tap. If you hold in the joystick button, you activate an action menu to deal with obstacles. You can choose to jump over fallen trees, throw dynamite at rocks or to let the bear jump out and dig away dirt from the tracks.</plot>

The megapede will use grow pills on the field to get even bigger and will use the edges of the screen and bunkers to make its way further down the screen towards you. Once the megapede touches you it&apos;s game over. Grow pills can be destroyed with ten shots while each segment of the megapede takes only one. Bunkers will also take ten shots to destroy as they will speed up the descent of the megapede and interfere with your shots. Be wary also of the spider which scampers across the screen depositing grow pills as his touch is also lethal to your base. The player has only one life to show his or her merits.

  <plot>Loadstar is a rail-shooter concerned with shooting enemies while navigating your ship, much like Sewer Shark. You&apos;re actually on rails in this game, as you travel in a truck/train called Loadstar along a magnetic rail network covering the moon. Shifting the cursor to the edge of the screen changes to a different track when available, with incorrect turns either killing you instantly or moving you off-course from the level end. Direction indicators and distant landmarks help keep you driving in the right direction, while accidents, track closures, and robot cops work to keep you from it. Your weapons &quot;tag&quot; enemies and force them to explode, or can tag incoming shots and deflect them with a separate shield button. Gameplay is broken into three levels as you race from one destination to another to escape with your cargo. The game features sophisticated full-motion video cutscenes breaking up the levels and providing the story. Barry Primus and Ned Beatty star.</plot>

  <plot>1829: The Esmerelda, a cargo ship carrying gold, sinks to the bottom of the ocean.1927: A treasure hunter called Howard Kelp dons a diving suit and searches for the bullion in the wreck.Treasure Trap is an isometric action adventure similar to Head Over Heels, but less abstract in its theme. The player guides the diver in a series of rooms (100 total) where the main goal is to collect gold. The main hazard encountered is the sea life that occupied the vacant ship. The character has no weapons, but carries a limited amount of &quot;smart fishes&quot;, trained piranhas that attack and destroy all the enemies in the room. Since the player starts with 2 fishes and only receives a new one at each 80 gold bars collected, most of the time the enemies have to be avoided by staying away or jumping over them. Stacking boxes and other objects stops the fauna from getting to the character (and also allows access to high places). There&apos;s an air gauge that is constantly depleting at the bottom-right of the screen. It can be filled with the compressed air tanks scattered in some rooms. Some doors require geometric-shaped keys. These can be collected and stored in three slots at the bottom-left of the screen. The game allows saving at each 50 gold collected.</plot>

  <plot>Darklands is an epic role playing game set in medieval Germany. You can begin by either selecting a pre-made party (quickstart) or by creating your own characters. Creating your characters is quite interesting, as you begin when they&apos;re 10 and choose a career path for them. The more time you choose at a certain career path, in 5 year periods, the better your character will become, and this is all before the adventure begins. Whilst in a city or other inhabited area, you&apos;re given choices on how to proceed, sort of like a which-way book. This is the way you&apos;ll communicate and move about within towns and castles. Once you&apos;ve left a city, you&apos;re taken to the travel screen, which is a real time map of Germany with a lone figure representing your party. Here you travel around the countryside, getting into adventures and meeting friends and enemies...Combat (speaking of enemies) is real time, but you can pause the action to give orders, so it&apos;s sort of pseudo-turn based. The game has an epic scope, and can go on for as long as you&apos;d like it to. The main goal is to collect as much fame for you and your party as possible, because the more fame you have the better quests you&apos;ll receive, and the better the rewards.</plot>

After a while a new menace would surface and the missions changed slightly.The story was told in full-motion video, which added a dramatic feel to the game.

  <plot>RS-2 is a side scrolling shooter, single player, with power-ups and large end-level bosses. Each level (or &quot;act&quot; as the game calls them) starts with a picture foreshadowing the end-boss ship.Power-ups come in the form of yellow balls with a letter in them, which appear when the player shoots jukebox-shaped enemies. The letter K is halve moons, B is target-seeking fireballs, S is scatter shot and L is laser beams (plaid laser beams).At the start of the game, the first two power-ups will equip the player&apos;s ship with two pods, after that the player can get the different weapons. Picking up a power-up changes weapons of the dual pods. Unlike other shooter games, picking up more of the same power-up type does not make the player&apos;s weapon stronger.There are no extra lives or continues, the player only has one health bar making it a difficult game to beat. Flying through enemies or geting hit by bullets decreases health, and when all health is gone the player&apos;s ship crashes and it&apos;s game over.The game is mainly a matter of remembering enemy patterns and memorizing when and where the enemies will appear. The movement patterns of the end bosses seem to be deliberately designed to deceive the player the first time he encounters them. For example, at one point the first boss will move up in a way that the player thinks he has to fly underneath it, at which point the boss will suddenly stomp down.</plot>

  <plot>Before there was a game called Master of Orion, SimTex head Steve Barcia presented a prototype to MicroProse Software and gaming journalists Alan Emrich and Tom Hughes.This game is called Star Lords. It is much like Master of Orion, only rather unpolished (even by the humble production standards of the almighty MOO). The basics are there, though: you start out with one planet in one star system and are charged with building a galactic empire. This means researching techs, building ships and colonies, and confronting alien civilizations. Several randomly generated opponents will do their best to stop you from realizing your goal.Released as freeware in 2001, Star Lords is an artifact for those interested in the history of MOO and game design in general.</plot>

For every room you visit, another 6 minutes goes by, and at 8:12 the alarm clock will ring, and save your life.Your secondary objective is to increase your dream-state. You start with a &quot;bad dream&quot;, but by killing monsters, and collecting chalices, you can get much worse dreams, like &quot;horrible dream&quot; or &quot;deadly vision&quot;. Your dream-state is displayed in text-form at the top of the screen, and does not affect the game in any other way.This is a horror game, and you will face zombies, bats, ghosts, and other terrifying creatures. If they touch you, you lose one of your five lives. You can collect different items, like guns, crucifixes, clocks, and other stuff. Your inventory can hold up to three items at once.You can kill some enemies with the gun, but many are immune to it. Crucifixes can freeze enemies, and clocks slows them down.The game consists of a huge maze of interconnected rooms. It&apos;s easy to get lost, and the game is almost impossible to complete, even if you cheat. So this is for anyone who wants a big challenge.</plot>

  <plot>Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer RenΘ Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.</plot>

It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. You soon learn of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor&apos;s daughter.Tex&apos;s first adventure (and the only one released for systems other than DOS or Windows PCs) takes you through the seedy West Coast world of 2033. The game is icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting your Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section.</plot>

In the first two rounds of gameplay the gameboard consists of a giant TV with nine channels; one of the players chooses a channel (representing a particular category) revealing a question; the first player to buzz in and provide the correct answer earns points. The are a variety of categories available (some of these are &quot;video high&quot;, &quot;cop shows&quot;, &quot;saturday night live&quot;, &quot;soap operas&quot;, and many more) which will vary from game to game. Sometimes a surprise channel may appear which doesn&apos;t have a question, but awards or removes points from a player. These rounds end when all of the supplied questions have been exhausted. Near the end of the second round, the lowest scoring player is eliminated from the game leaving two players for the final round.The final &quot;think real fast&quot; round lasts for thirty seconds; during this time the players need to answer as many short answer questions as possible to earn points.

You have to collect souvenirs from various places as proof you&apos;ve been there, and then get back to your village in time or else Caesar will win. It allows for up to 4 players or you can play against the computer. The game track has 54 squares that can be landed on which represent countries, challenges, prisons, magic potions, traps, rest, and meeting character opportunities. The druid Getafix is host and will hand out magic potion flasks to players (except Obelix who, as fans of the comics know, fell into a potion when he was very young). You can acquire some interesting gadgets from the druid-spy Dubbelosix, that will help you move more quickly. To win the recquired souvenir items, you have to either answer the questions asked in the country squares or buy them from the Phoenician merchant Ekonomikrisis with sestertii won in challenge squares. The scoundrel Tortuous Convolvulus will also try to impede the players progress, so look out.</plot>

  <plot>Aggravation is a board game where the point is to bring your chips back to home base after going around the game board. This game uses ASCII graphics to display the game board and allows for up to four players to play in turn. Up to three of these players can be controlled by the computer. After rolling a six or one a player may place one of their four chips on to the game board and try to traverse it and head back home to a safe base. Landing on another player will mean that that player must take that chip back and restart with it by rolling a one or six. Rolling a six allows the player to roll again and players may not jump over other chips of their own. Therefore although named Aggravation this game, unlike the board game of the same name, plays and looks more like the board game Sorry.</plot>

  <plot>(From the Infocom Home Page site)Washington and Moscow are the capitals of the Superpowers, but the cold War is fought at the front: in Eastern Bloc countries like Frobnia and adjacent neutral countries like Litzenburg. In these countries, where all strangers are suspect and all actions observed, paranoia and vulnerability are inescapable. In these countries, innocent travelers get caught in the web of international espionage. This is the setting for Border Zone. Border Zone consists of three chapters. In each chapter, you play a different character (an American businessman, a Western spy, and an Eastern spy) involved in unique puzzles and goals. The chapters take place at different times and at different locations; as a player, you will get the most satisfaction if you play the chapters in order. Border Zone has a built-in clock which drives the story forward. Unlike other Infocom stories, the clock in Border Zone continues to tick even while you stop to think. So if you find yourself in a dangerous situation, you can&apos;t just sit back and relax. Whether you type in a command or not, characters will move around, events will happen, and the story will proceed.</plot>

  <plot>With the scrolls now in his possession, The Last Ninja begins training a new order of Ninja. During a training session he is mysteriously transported to XXth-century New York. The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities. Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump. Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There&apos;s a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they&apos;ll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him. There are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.</plot>

  <plot>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</plot>

  <plot>SkyNET is Bethesda&apos;s last game based on the Terminator franchise. Originally developed as an expansion pack to Terminator: Future Shock, SkyNET eventually became its own standalone product. Its major features are an updated version of the Xngine allowing for play in the sharper 640x480 resolution (and the ability to update Future Shock to the same), a new single-player campaign, and a new multiplayer deathmatch component.In the single-player game, you must stop the machines from launching a recovered nuclear weapon. The story takes place over seven missions broken into various sections and &quot;levels,&quot; with night progressing into daylight as the game goes on. The locations are also more varied and interactive than those featured in the first game, with levels like the basement of the Cyberdyne building, and a sinking nuclear submarine. Driving and flying levels return from Future Shock, as do the mission briefings, which are now handled entirely in FMV. The game seems to act as a prequel to Future Shock, with the most advanced technology and player weapons from that game not appearing in the course of the single-player missions in SkyNET.The multiplayer game allows for eight players over a LAN and two over IPX. The levels are contained recreations of sections or ideas in the single-player game, like a block of cityscape, a shattered freeway, or an open valley, and many can be played at either dawn or dusk. Vehicles are available in most levels, and unlike in single-player, can be entered and exited freely. You also have the option to play as a Terminator, with reduced movement speed, a little more toughness, and the classic red-tinted vision with information overlays.</plot>

  <plot>Eddie Murphy became a star in the police film Beverly Hills Cop, and it was this license that Tynesoft used to create a game featuring four distinct sub-games, each of which can be practiced from the main screen in some versions. First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.</plot>

  <plot>Commander Keen 4: Secret of the Oracle is a platform game, the fourth in the Commander Keen series as a whole, and the first in the second series Goodbye, Galaxy.Eight-year-old genius Billy &quot;Commander Keen&quot; Blaze receives an interstellar transmission while working on a Photachyon Transceiver (a radio that can receive signals anywhere in the galaxy). While the transmission is choppy, Billy manages to figure out that the galaxy is once again in danger from an alien race known as Shikadi. In order to get more information about this threat, he sets out to consult the Oracle. But it turns out that the eight Council Members necessary for the Oracle&apos;s activation have been kidnapped by the Shikadi and imprisoned in the dangerous Shadowlands. Keen heads out to save the Council Members.The game begins with a top-down map of the Shadowlands. This is the level select screen, where you can walk around and choose the next level you want to enter (though some of the levels are islands located on a lake and require you to find a wetsuit if you want to reach them). On each level, you have to either make your way to the exit, or find a Council Member if he is held captive on this level. Once you reach the exit, you&apos;re back on the overhead map. The levels are typically full of enemy creatures, such as poison slugs, deadly mosquitoes or hopping crazy mushrooms. There are also many hazards - pits, cannons, spears. If Keen gets shot or touched by an enemy, or falls into a pit or touches something hazardous, he dies, and you lose one life. Thankfully, Keen can stun most enemies with his raygun, although some cannot be stunned at all, and some are only stunned for a few seconds. Keen also carries a pogo stick which allows him to jump very high. Other items to find include: ammo, gems that acts as keys to open locked doors, bonus items which give score, raindrops (100 raindrops give extra life) and the rare Lifewater Flask which gives an extra life.</plot>

  <plot>Ducks is a former shareware, now freeware Lemmings clone for DOS. Instead of clearing the path to a portal for green creatures, the player controls a green duck, the leader of oranges ducks that must be guided to a rocket ship. Clicking and holding the right mouse button on any place of the gamefield makes the leader move towards it. When the green duck is close enough to the orange ducks, they start to follow it. Moving the mouse while holding down the button makes the green duck change direction accordingly. The rocket ship has a number on top, indicating the number of ducks necessary for it to take off.Numerous hazards scattered through the levels kill the ducks. Instead of Lemmings&apos; more aseptic approach to violence, deaths on Ducks are quite gory, with the animals exploding and their blood splattering on nearby surfaces. A slimy monster wanders some levels and devours the birds, and they can also be murdered by spikes, fans, electric bolts and long falls. Switches turn off and on the electric arcs, but can only be activated by the leader, and only once per level. The ESC button makes them commit suicide, useful to quit a level made unsolvable by wrong actions.Several tools help to clear the path to the rocket. They appear as icons at the bottom of the screen, and can be changed with the arrow key and deployed with the left mouse button. The bomb explodes the scenery, removing chunks of it each time. Horizontal bridges and diagonal ladders help the ducks to cross safely over chasms and dangerous environments. The balloon acts like the bomb, but it goes upwards instead of falling. Stop signs makes the orange ducks stop their march, instead of walking toward deathly devices and places. Bricks can be placed on top of each other, to manually construct bridges. The teleport transports the leader anywhere in the level. Seagulls and flying saucers replace the leader, guiding the birds and moving automatically from one side to the other (the saucer goes up and down as well).There&apos;s a level editor available as an optional download on the developer site.</plot>

  <plot>Win, Lose or Draw was a popular TV show requiring artistic skills and an ability to think laterally. A player on your team draws something on the big game board, and you must work out what it represents. They will be common expressions depicted literally, such as &apos;bright idea&apos; showing a light bulb over somebody&apos;s head, and &apos;cabin fever&apos; as a rickety building next to a man with a thermometer in his mouth. In this computerised implementation the drawing phase of the game is handled by the computer, so your task is simply to guess the meaning of the picture by thinking laterally. Your team has 60 seconds, and you can guess repeatedly, but the picture takes time to take shape. If you fail to guess correctly, the opposition has 15 seconds to guess it (with a single try) to steal the money.</plot>

  <plot>An enemy with the codename &apos;Quake&apos;, which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake&apos;s realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.id Software&apos;s followup to Doom and Doom II, &quot;Quake&quot; is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id&apos;s earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.Unlike Doom&apos;s rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake&apos;s levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological &apos;slipgate&apos; as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom&apos;s colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player&apos;s weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.</plot>

  <plot>Dungeons of Kremlin is an obscure Russian Doom clone that sports a game engine similar in complexity to Wolfenstein 3D, being strictly composed of a maze like labyrinths whereas the floor height is consistent throughout.You are faced by enemies such as bats, mutants, wizards, and the like. Weapons to collect are what you come to expect, including a machine gun and shotgun. An interesting game play facet is levels are littered with magic mushrooms and pints of beer, which must be avoided, as they deplete your health.The game doesnÆt use a save game system, instead, like Dark Forces, you are given three lives to work with, and after they are spent, it is game over.Three levels are included, each one is significantly large and suitably difficult. Visually, in terms of textures and sprite art, this is quite similar in style to Wisdom TreeÆs Super NoahÆs Ark 3-D.The games story concerns archeologist&apos;s digging somewhere above the dungeons of the Kremlin, and this has upset the evil that lurks down there, and effectively awakens the evil things. All text in the game is in Russian.</plot>

  <plot>A &quot;first-person, medieval action adventure with role-playing elements,&quot; as the back of the box classifies it. Based on 3D Realms&apos; Build engine, Witchaven is a first-person fantasy slasher akin to Heretic or Doom. The plot is straightforward: Descending into a volcanic pit on the Island of Char, you must fight your way through goblins, demons and other sorts of fiends toward the mystical lair of Witchaven to defeat the witches who have cursed the land with a shroud of darkness. Unlike other first-person action games of its time, the game contains a rudimentary role-playing experience level system in which you accumulate experience from killing monsters and acquiring items, so as to become more powerful (you can rise to seventh level). Weapons include such items as knives, swords, bows, morning stars, battle axes and throwing axes, and halberds. Spells such as Scare, Night Vision, Fly, Fireball, and, of course, Nuke, are available via scrolls you find, although the more powerful spells require that you have attained a certain experience level (Nuke, which disintegrates your opponents, requires you to be level 5 to cast). Scattered around the levels are potions which grant you such boons as healing, invisibility and strength. Nevertheless, the resemblance to role-playing games ends there.Witchaven is possibly the most gratuitously violent and gruesome commercial game of its time. And though it contains a setting that allows you to tone down the gore, even with this setting on it cannot be stressed how intensely offensive some may find this game. According to the LSAC rating, it also contains &quot;Partial Nudity,&quot; though it is probably limited to the bare-butted goblins running around throughout the game and some female creatures that resemble ancient fertility cult statuettes and hurl their innards at you.</plot>

To get to Grelminar, you have to complete several maze-like levels. Your sole weapon is a fireball spell, which can be used an unlimited number of times and can be charged up to cause more damage. You can also find one-time use items: bolts and nukes. A bolt launches several fireballs in a machine-gun fashion, while a nuke launches a ring of fireballs in all directions. The various enemies (such as orcs or trolls) that you meet while exploring are the main target for those fireballs. However, you can also destroy whole sections of walls, which is often necessary to complete the level. Items you can find include (apart from bolts and nukes) healing potions, keys to open doors, and scrolls that provide hints. There isn&apos;t an overhead map in the game, but you have a compass to guide you. What&apos;s more, various areas of the map have specific names displayed at the bottom of the screen, making it a bit easier to navigate.</plot>

Your movements are controlled with one section of the keyboard while your shot direction is controlled with another. The islands naturally get better defended and progressively harder to pass but can be cleared with careful strategy and quick reflexes. The missile towers are often protected by buildings which surround it and it takes multiple shots to clear a section of the building. Thankfully one shot is sufficient to destroy the missile tower itself.The game has different setting for hardness and can be made more of a challenge by raising the speed of enemy missiles and slowing your movement. Alternative to the keyboard controls you can use a joystick to guide your hovercraft while using the keyboard with your other hand to shoot in whichever direction.</plot>

Crashing results in an external replay of your final moments.Joystick and mouse control options exist, with the mouse being ultimately faster but harder to learn. 125, 250 and 500cc options exist, with the difficulty higher on the more powerful bikes. You can contest a full season, single race, or simply practice on a free track. 16 circuits are featured, from Suzuka and Misano to Rijeka and Philip Island, with races over 5-50 laps. Your opponents are seven factory Suzuki riders from various classes at the time, including 1993 500cc World Champion Kevin Schwantz.</plot>

  <plot>Rolling Jack is a Boulder Dash clone. On each level, the protagonist (a smiling, red ball), who can move freely in 4 directions, must collect all the coins and then go into the exit. There are numerous dangers in the levels: rocks which fall when there is free space beneath them, and which can kill our hero by falling on him, or block his progress and make him unable to complete the level; flying screws and chattering teeth, which fly along walls and kill the hero if they collide with him (the chattering teeth must be killed, e.g. by dropping rocks on them, as each such a monster contains 9 necessary coins); grenades that explode when they fall or when something falls on them; rotating spheres that push the hero in a particular direction; one-way passages; and pushable blocks that must be pushed intelligently. The hero can find bombs that he can set up at any point; they then explode after a while, destroying any neighboring objects (apart from certain, indestructible walls). The game features a level editor which allows for the creation of up to 120 custom levels.</plot>

  <plot>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia&apos;s automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg&apos;s high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.The game is viewed from within AGAV&apos;s cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</plot>

  <plot>The computer game of an Anna Popkess book (which was originally bundled with the game) uses an interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN for short. ItÆs set in a post-apocalyptic world of guards desperately attempting to retain order over mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive use of the death penalty. Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state.Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.</plot>

Should your ball fall between the flippers it will drop to a lower level until finally you&apos;re at the bottom, and then you lose a life.Each part of the table has its own quirks, secrets and purpose (for example, in the middle section you build a spaceship and have to protect it from two missile-firing guns on the right.There are also hidden, or secret, stages in the game: one is an &quot;egg&quot; with four parts you have to crack, another is a breakout clone only with pinball mechanics and another is a bizarre &quot;Doom pinball&quot;.

  <plot>In this fantasy role-playing game, an army of evil extra-dimensional creatures is building above the Gandolan mountains, threatening the civilized regions to the south. There is no army to defend the lands, but if a few hardy adventurers can find a magical staff in the castle of a long-dead mage named Grelminar, the gate can be closed and the invasion averted.The player controls a party of four characters, each with some standard-issue attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Piety, Body Points and Magic Points. The game also features three of the usual character classes (fighters, mages and priests), and there are different spell lists for each of the spell-casting classes. Players can create their own characters or use the ones provided by the game; either way, progress is automatically saved from time to time (though there is a reset button which allows the player to start over from the beginning).The game starts out in a town (which is portrayed simply by a text-based menu system) and then proceeds into a multi-level dungeon. While exploring the dungeon, different areas of the screen display different information. There is a first-person, ninety-degree-turning view, an automap and, in some areas, a textual description. These are supplemented by random third-person, turn-based combat encounters which take place in the window that normally shows the 3-D dungeon view. In typical role-playing style, combat yields rewards of gold and experience (and sometimes equipment), and characters gain in abilities as they increase in experience.</plot>

  <plot>The planet Arrakis (also known as Dune for its sandy landscape) is the only place in the known universe where Melange (more commonly known as the Spice) can be found. The Spice is the basis of interstellar travel and thus the standard of the Imperial economy. To increase productivity, The Padishah Emperor has invited three powerful Houses (Harkonnen, Atreides and Ordos) to compete against one another economically and bring up spice production. Competition among these houses begins peacefully but soon turns ugly as they battle each other with armed troops, advanced weaponry, and spies. The planet itself is also hostile, with dangerous sandworms inhabiting the spice fields.Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert&apos;s famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.After a mission is completed, the player can select the next mission on a map of Dune. This choice determines the layout of the next map to be played, but has no effect on the overall campaign.</plot>

The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition.The weeks passed without any sign of the monster&apos;s presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte&apos;s Island... three members of the expedition will set on board the Nautilus, submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes the Anorax&apos; role to find out more.The most part of the game is spent on the Nautilus which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g. fighting against a shark. The game is played in real-time which means the key to success is being at the right location in the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable and regular waiting times. The player also needs to watch Nemo&apos;s mood, if he angers Nemo, e.g. by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point &amp; click and has no function to save progress.</plot>

  <plot>This is a 16-color DOS PC shareware clone of the classic &quot;Star Trek&quot; game of 1970&apos;s mainframes. However since Star Trek is a license, several names have been changed to avoid infringing the copyright, but the gameplay remains intact.The game itself is simple. Each sector of the universe is an 8x8 grid containing planets, starbases, friendly or enemy starships and suns. Within this sector you can navigate to any point on the grid with impulse engines, or venture to a new sector using Warp engines. Your ship is equipped with lasers and torpedos to help defend yourself, and scanners to assess the nearby threats and nearby sectors. Additionally you&apos;ll need to find starbases for quick repairs and to resupply and may also discover new and unusual planets to beam down and explore. A nice touch to EGA Trek over all other clones is a &quot;viewscreen&quot; window which provides a crude graphic view of nearby objects.Two distinct empires make your enemies list. The Mongols are the forces you&apos;ll run into again and again. Armed battle cruisers of various strengths. The other enemy are the Vandal, seen only in 1 type of ship, but able to cloak and avoid your sensors.Should your vessel suffer enough damage, various systems will begin to fail and quite possibly you&apos;ll be down to your final reserve power and life support. From this point, sustaining more damage or not being able to repair the ship will result in the deaths of all crew members aboard and the ultimate failure of your mission. Success on the other hand is brought about by clearing the entire galaxy of hostile Mongol and Vandal fleets... with bonuses for discoveries, rescues and living crew members.</plot>

Each offers a customized Zephyr and each has advantages and disadvantages.The game itself is a cross between Doom and Hi-Octane. you have to race around maze-like cyberpunk locations (wastelands, cities, etc.) from a first person view and shoot your opponents with an independent turret-mounted cannon and collecting power-ups such as energy, shields, etc. to win the races.</plot>

  <plot>Raptor is a vertically-scrolling shoot &apos;em up. It features smooth scrolling VGA graphics, a variety of enemies on ground, air and sea, and an original soundtrack.After completing each level you have the option of upgrading your ship with a powerful arsenal of weapons and goodies. Some weapons are effective on only ground or air targets, while some are on both. There are some really advanced weapons like the auto-track mini-gun which can effectively destroy almost any kind of targets without aiming the ship.Dying in shoot&apos;em ups can be annoying, especially if you have to start all over the beginning. However, in Raptor you can save your game between each level. If you have enough credit you can even buy multiple shields for further protection.The 2010 edition of Raptor: Call of the Shadows includes improved graphics and native support for higher resolutions (640x400, 960x600 and 1280x800). Standard graphics are also available.</plot>

  <plot>Championship Manager starts a successful series of football management games, which means that you don&apos;t actually control your players during matches, but you&apos;re in charge of choosing the starting lineup and tactics. Matches are played out through a running commentary, with the chance to interrupt it to make substitutions or tactical changes. Each player&apos;s performance is rated out of 10, and these are among the many statistics stored throughout the game.The game features all the most important British competitions, and the database 80 league teams (each with complete squads) and 380 non-league and European teams (who you will sometimes play against, but can not purchase their players - buying overseas players is dealt with elsewhere). There are 1500 players featured, each rated on attributes such as passing, tackling and creativity, and with details such as age and nationality also stored, and 650 managers, coaches, scouts and physios.Between matches you can purchase or sell your players and trim your squad to suit your needs. When you approach a player, and both the club and player are interested, you put in an offer and see if the club accepts it - they may request an increase. The player will have demands for contract length and wage, before a deal can be completed.The game follows the season by splitting each week into weekday and weekend, each of which may or may not include a match, and after you have done everything you press Done, and the game progresses in time.</plot>

  <plot>ANSI Dude is an interesting action-adventure. The name of the game obviously refers to its quite sophisticated text-only ANSI graphics.The animated intro explains the background story (sort of): You play ANSI Dude, who, for unknown and pretty irrelevant reasons, lands his spacecraft on some strange planet and enters a 24-level dungeon. Each dungeon level takes up one screen, seen from above. Each level is a maze, often filled with enemies; some blocks may be moved, other destroyed, so you can create you way through the maze. Other elements of the maze are conveyor belts which move you quickly to another position; mines you should avoid; locked doors that can only be opened by key cards you have to collect first, etc. To help you, there are also energy and battery recharge units as well as extra score &amp;quot;thingys&amp;quot; and 1-ups. To get to the exit and thus the next level, you have not only to eliminate &amp;quot;Evil Entities&amp;quot;, but also to solve different puzzles using the four special items at your disposition. These items are: The Suction Cup, which sucks moveable blocks out of nooks and crannies; the Sonic Pickaxe breaks destructible walls and moveable blocks; the Plasma Rifle is used to get rid of enemies and sets trees on fire, and the Force Field finally allows you to set up a barrier for your enemies. There finally is a Self-Destruct option, which allows you to restart a level when you get stuck without losing a life.You have to be careful about your resources: Each use of one of your special items uses up a certain amount of battery, and if your battery is depleted -- bye-bye! While the first few levels are fairly easy, they soon begin to get more difficult, and you will have to think about the right strategy to get through -- often, just blowing any moving enemy will just use up all your energy, and it may be better to set up some force fields.The game is entirely controlled by key presses. Gameplay occurs in &amp;quot;timed delay&amp;quot; -- which means that it is basically turn-based, but if you do nothing for some time, the game still progresses, so you sometimes have to act quick.Other features of the game is in-game help on controls and text character interpretations, which you should read well, because (as the readme file puts it succinctly) &amp;quot;this can be a confusing game at times&amp;quot;, as well as a high-score list.</plot>

  <plot>Tie-in of the rather unknown but truly brilliant board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers... if it wasn&apos;t for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders&apos; heads in.The computer game is an extremely accurate conversion of the board game - virtually every aspect has been taken care of.What&apos;s especially refreshing about this game is that it does not rely on luck - it&apos;s pure strategy. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something inbetween) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</plot>

  <plot>Crazy Cows is a turn-based action/strategy game much similiar to the turn-based combat modes introduced by games like Jagged Alliance or X-Com although less complex.The game itself is only one big battleground where two teams: the Grey Cows, and the Brown Cows (Yes, the heroes are cows).Each team must battle each other for victory until the last person...uh...cow wins. Each team (or in this case - herd...dry humor there...) has a number of cows that will fight for the cause. There is no advantages or disadvantages of each team, just difference of color (like chess).The battleground map, other than the two herds, also consist of scattered weapons: a katana sword or a shotgun and various terrain. However, the battleground map also introduced fog of war, where both team players must search the grey areas in order to achieve line of sight. Once they grey area&apos;s are explored, it stays that way. The game play is divided into 2 major sequences:Movement, andCombat.Movement consists of moving your cow in accordance to the Movement Points (MUs...nice coincidence, eh?). While moving, your cow can usually do 3 things: 1. Search and explore the battleground to find enemies and weapons;Pick up weapons, this is done automatically by moving to the square, where the weapon is allocated. A cow picking up a katana (melee) automatically becomes a Ninja Cow in a neat Ninja outfit. A cow picking up a shotgun because a Mean Cow Punk with black shades (ranged);Move into strategic squares for defence or offence.Combat depends on what weapon your cow wields. If the cow is a ninja, eventually she (cows are she&apos;s, right?) has to come within range of the enemy cow - adjacent square to the enemy cow. Shotgun cows can attack enemies cows at range within line of sight.Basically it&apos;s a fun game...for cows. Moo.</plot>

  <plot>In Extremis is a science-fiction First Person Shooter (FPS) in which you play as a crashed space pilot stranded aboard a derelict vessel. To escape, you must collect key cards and insert them into terminals. Valid cards will give you a code for the current level. That code will grant you access to lockers containing weapons and equipment. A second set of key cards opens up elevators, allowing you to travel to deeper into the ship&apos;s 29 levels.Technically, the game is similar to graphical updates of the Wolfenstein 3-D engine (such as used in the Blake Stone series), and features textured walls along with optional floor and ceiling textures. Faked lighting effects (your screen shifts to a different colour as you pass under coloured lights) also appear. Architecture is still limited to 90 degree angles and heavy on mazes.Aside from finding new weapons and blasting aliens, you have a limited inventory of pickups to manage. Your suit&apos;s air tanks are constantly depleting, and must be replaced with fresh tanks before they run dry. Your suit contains a motion tracker and nightvision, both which drain the same replaceable batteries. Syringes can be collected and used to restore your health. Finally, alien nests appear on some levels and endlessly spawn new enemies. Bombs can be collected and deployed to destroy these.</plot>

Thor the Warrior, has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route. Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</plot>

  <plot>Kithe was an e-mag (electronic magazine) series that ran, on and off, for three years, primarily documenting the comings and goings of members of the computer art collective Mistigris through text captures of postings to echomail networks, reformatted as articles. Oftentimes the conversational style was a poor fit for conventional publication, or a biting quip was just too short to publish on its own, and so these items were sat on until a suitable form of presentation could be devised. This form was, it turns out, the text adventure game -- where themes and topics of articles could inform the environment in which they were presented, and where polemics could be presented as emerging from the virtual mouths of the very personages who put them in writing... and most importantly, where people are going to be expecting to be reading lots of text anyhow.Hundreds of articles are collected and thematically organized in different rooms, their specific display triggered (some more straightforwardly than others) by appropriate use of objects to which they are linked. Text adventure tropes (such as darkness) interfere with access to some areas, which become &quot;unlocked&quot; after the right object is found -- in return for reading, the player will be rewarded with... more to read!A vague game lurks in the background of this surreal library-cum-adventure; some articles and some areas convey keywords necessary, as in Beyond the Tesseract, for the nominal &quot;completion&quot; of the game -- but as in any good cave crawl, the reward here is really in thorough exploration.</plot>

All right, weÆve all had such moments. But Lolly is a doll. Animated by a stroke of lightning, she suddenly has life, a sweet tooth and a quest: Onward to the land where candy grows and the refrigerators never run out!ItÆs a hostile world for small, innocent and rather hungry little dolls û thatÆs why youÆve got to help Lolly find her way through eight big levels in this jumpÆnÆrun game. After the escape from the toy factory, the way to the promised land leads through places like a ghost town, a snow world and even LollyÆs own cottony dreams. The way is far from safe: plenty of traps and monsters threaten a dollÆs life, but good timing, athletic leaps and an ample supply of lollipops to fling at obtrusive enemies help mastering any challenge. In desperate situations, Lolly can take a snapshot with her pocket camera, which instantly destroys all opponents on the screen. Huge level bosses guard the exit of each world; defeating the mega-monsters requires specific tactics. Fortunately, there is support: chests contain key items (to unlock different parts of each level), power-ups and plenty of sweets, of course. On the downside, the boxes may also yield harmful objects that jumble up LollyÆs controls or even hurt her. Tender dolls of that model can sustain three hits before they break apart.

It also features the 26 NHL teams at the time as well as 6 International teams to choose from.The gameplay is similar to many other hockey games with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs or even a &quot;Just Play&quot; option that instantly took the player to a random game. There is also a &quot;Simulation Mode&quot; that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an &quot;Arcade Mode&quot; that was more action oriented and with less rules. A battery back-up keeps extensive track of stats and has a two-player option as well.</plot>

  <plot>Set in Ancient Rome, you start life as a poor slave in Herculaneum, which along with Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Versuvius. Eventually you travel to Rome and climb the social ladder, becoming a Captain in the army, a Senator and eventually Emperor of Rome. Four of the game&apos;s six levels are adventure style romps, while in the other two levels you control an army in an attempt to conquer an enemy of Rome. The game is made all the more interesting by the little details to be seen around the levels; from naked people running around the Baths, to buying slaves to fight in the Gladiatorial games. There are also RPG aspects to the game, especially in the way you have the freedom to choose how to deal with various problems.</plot>

  <plot>In TKO you can play the career of a boxer. Create your boxer by trading off a mixture of attributes, for example a boxer who cuts easily will not tire as easily, and a boxer whose best punch is to the head will not punch to the body as efficiently The main 1st-person perspective view shows the faces of both you and your opponent, including progressively injured faces as you land punches. A small overhead view helps you see when you or your opponent are close to the ropes.</plot>

  <plot>Following ten thousand years of the War of Dominion, the ten mutually battling races found surprise armistice beneath the domination of a single warlord, Hjenlnath, following infiltration of all major powers by his hitherto unknown race of shapechangers. The political landscape simmers following 30 years of ceasefire, while the city of Seratika in a central Neutral Zone attempts to dictate a lasting peace and resolve disputes. A hub of activity and adventure, it is also the only place in the world representatives of all major races can be found rubbing shoulders...Another spin-off from the silly fantasy adventure premise of Legend of the Red Dragon (following the prevalent Noun of the Adjective Noun naming scheme), this BBS door injects an extra dose of filthy whimsy while yielding vastly expanded gameplay options and side-shows more in the vein of Usurper.Though the fundamental RPG gameplay is a la Progress Quest (i.e. go find monsters... slay monsters... steal treasure... improve equipment... defeat masters... gain levels... raise stats) and remains much the same as its predecessors, it boasts many more nuances within the basic framework -- a huge selection of possible new race / class combinations (including the esteemed &quot;Basket Weaver&quot; -- a conservative tradesman type not suited for adventuring but guaranteed regular income) is only the beginning before you factor in choosing which strange new god to worship, which guild to work under, which magic spells to learn and which equipment to enhance.If you choose to stay in town, you can build your fortune and reputation gambling and slaying (and laying) other players and NPCs (with optional finishing moves straight out of Mortal Kombat) without ever darkening a dungeon&apos;s doorstep!The activities of higher-level players ostensibly influence the plot of the overarching gameworld! As what superficially amounts to a &quot;mature&quot; LORD clone, all in all BOOB is a lot better than it needs to be -- and offers further room to improve with user-contributed in-game modules (or (groan) &quot;implants&quot;, two official ones including the Hall of Justice and the Assassin&apos;s Guild.)Beyond all that, of course, there lurks the shadowy rumour of the Obsidian Baboon itself, waiting to spring itself on unwary players who foolishly think that they&apos;ve figured out everything the game has to offer.</plot>

As the title suggests, you&apos;re supposed to find out who shot singer Johnny Rock (or at least who hired the guys who shot him) and put them behind bars.There are some differences between this game and previous American Laser Games shooters. Instead of a wimpy pistol, you get a tommy gun (which doesn&apos;t need to be reloaded). Unfortunately, you also have limited ammo and need to buy more at times.

  <plot>2072; orbiting Saturn aboard TriOptimum Corporation&apos;s Citadel space station. You awaken from a six-month healing coma with a broken memory and a newly-installed cybernetic interface to discover that most of the other occupants of the station are dead... or worse. The station&apos;s self-sufficient AI, SHODAN (Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network) has assumed total control and seems hell-bent on destroying all human life. TriOptimum believes you are Citadel&apos;s last hope. Can you save yourself and smash SHODAN&apos;s evil plans? System Shock incorporates first-person shooter and adventure gameplay styles, with role-playing elements thrown in. To complete the game, you&apos;ll have to explore the ten levels of Citadel, solving puzzles, fighting enemies and fulfilling objectives. On your way, you&apos;ll encounter numerous enemies - robots, cyborgs and mutants, all of which can be fought back with a variety of weapons. Some of the weapons use ammo, while other have infinite ammo and instead draw on your electric energy. Some weapons are more effective on certain foes - e.g. the dart gun only works on organic enemies, while the magpulse is best used against robots. Once killed, the enemies can be searched for ammo and other items. You can also find items in crates, cabinets, corpses or just lying around on the ground. Apart from weapons and ammo, you&apos;ll find patches (such as medical patches, which replenish your health; berserk patches, which temporarily increase your strength but cause hallucinations; detox patches, which remove the harmful effects of radiation and biohazard; etc.), grenades of various kinds (EMP grenades work great on robots, gas grenades are good for mutants, land mines can be used to set traps, etc.), battery packs for replenishing electricity, first aid kits for restoring health, and others. Thanks to your implant, you can install various pieces of hardware into your body, such as a booster which makes you go faster, or a head lantern to bright up dark areas. As you progress in the game, you&apos;ll find higher versions of existing hardware, which are more effective and useful. However, most hardware uses up your electric energy while it&apos;s active. At some places in the game, you have to find a wall-mounted &quot;cyberjack&quot; to go into cyberspace in order to find data that will help you, remotely open doors or unlock sealed areas, or give yourself clearance to access off-limits areas. Cyberspace is represented as a 3-D wireframe place, where you fly around freely in three dimensions, shoot hostile cyber-guards with phasers, and collect files represented as colorful cubes. The story of the game is mostly told through e-mail messages you receive, and electronic diaries (logs) left by various characters (as well as SHODAN herself), which are scattered around the space station.</plot>

If a unit&apos;s morale gets to low, they retreat, regardless of your orders. Other additions are allowing for reinforcements to appear on certain turns and weather factors.The scenario editor has been enhanced so that players cannot only create their own maps and scenarios, but their own custom units, including statistics and the graphics.

  <plot>Capture the Enemy Space Ship is a strategy game for one player. The players goal is to capture an enemy battle vessel without destroying it. The game takes place in an 8x8 grid; somewhere in the grid the enemy is hiding. To capture the enemy, all of the spaces around it need to be destroyed. On each turn the player can fire a phasor shot at one space in the grid which destroys it. The enemy moves every turn; while the last known position is known, its current location is unknown so there is a good chance the enemy will be destroyed if you aren&apos;t careful. The player begins the game with 25 shots; occasionally the enemy will attack which drains energy causing a few shots to be lost. The game is lost if the enemy is accidentally destroyed or is still not captured when shots run out.</plot>

Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you&apos;re goin&apos; in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It&apos;s path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you&apos;ll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don&apos;t expect much, but to retry the level.Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it&apos;ll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, &apos;til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that&apos;s the game basics.Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you&apos;ll have to solve each level in a hurry.</plot>

  <plot>Revelation is an abstract puzzle game based around cracking codes on safes. Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.</plot>

  <plot>This is the original Russian version of Lines. It is a turn-based board game. Each turn, three randomly colored balls fall on random grids of a 9x9 squares board. Your mission is to re-locate the balls (by moving one of them per turn) to form lines consisting of five or more balls of the same color. The lines can be arranged vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each line you build immediately disappears, giving you points. There is basically no end to the game, but your first objective is to surpass the 3000 points scored by the &quot;king&quot;. Once you surpass him, he loses the throne and you become the new king, but the game continues ad infinitum. You lose when the entire board is filled with balls.</plot>

  <plot>This game from 1987 is based on the adventures of the French comic book character Iznogoud. You are in the role of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud, whose only thought is to depose the Caliph of magical Baghdad and become &quot;Caliph instead of the Caliph!&quot; To accomplish this aim, you must wander around and interact with characters around you, acquiring objects along the way that may or may not be useful, and figure out how all this will help you achieve your goal.During the game, you have 4 different methods of interacting with other characters: you can give objects to them, you can threaten them, you can flatter them, and you can throw a tantrum. Depending on the character, these actions will elicit different responses--or none altogether. You will need objects for various things, and objects are all acquired from other characters. Some characters are helpful, others are not. But the right combination of your actions will help you to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, while the wrong ones will often land you in a cell beneath the palace. Just be careful not to lose your own head in the process!</plot>

Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.

  <plot>DND is a PC conversion of the seminal mainframe classic of the same name, which started computer role-playing games. The name of the game clearly comes from the Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) pen and paper role playing systems, and it uses D&amp;D rules. The game itself is a classic dungeon crawl. It could be counted as a &quot;rogue-like&quot; but hasn&apos;t got random dungeons. It was first released 1984 as a shareware version for DOS.DND lets you generate your character by randomly rolling attributes (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity and Charisma) and then select one of three classes (Cleric, Fighter or Magician, the first and last are able to cast spells). You then may visit the store where you can buy armour, weapons etc. -- of course, at the very beginning of the game you have no money to spend! Finally, you have a choice of five dungeons to enter, each one with several levels.The dungeons are depicted by a top-down text-graphics view. You only see the surrounding 3x3 squared of the current level. During exploring, you may encounter monsters which you battle in a very simplistic turn-based fight (you only have the options of Attacking and Evading). If you defeat the monster, you gain experience (sometimes resulting in upgrading a level), and some monsters also leave some treasure. Other treasures are randomly strewn in the dungeon, but beware! Some of them are protected by traps. Other sites you can get along are altars (where you can pray or spend money to get divine protection), books (which randomly change your attributes), fountains with random effects, wands which let you cast spells even as a fighter or Dragon&apos;s Lairs containing lot of loot, protected by a mighty dragons. There are also teleporters which may randomly zap you to some other part of the dungeon.The game offers no possibility to save your character -- when you die, it is as if your character never existed! So make sure to leave the dungeon often to buy the best possible equipment.</plot>

  <plot>All TV Satellite dishes have been stolen by a horde of crazed Schnozes. Astronauts were sent to the Moon to retrieve the dishes but have been captured by the villains and are now being forced to take part in bizarre alien rituals. The secret agent Skunny Hardnut is then sent to the Moon rescue the astronauts and retrieve the dishes, equipped with the state of the art Moonbuggy.Skunny: Lost in Space is a rework of Atari&apos;s Moon Patrol. Skunny has to scroll all the way right at each level, firing the Moonboogy&apos;s twin lasers against enemies and jumping craters. The Moonbuggy has limited ammo and energy. As he wanders throughout Moon&apos;s landscape, he can collect lives, ammo and health items.The player can choose any of the ten levels to start playing (two in the shareware version). The game features a &quot;smart&quot; save feature, which automatically saves the game if the player exits the level during gameplay.</plot>

  <plot>Super Bubble Mania is a shareware Pang clone. As in the original game, up to two players have to clear the screen of bubbles and other bouncing objects within a time limit. The characters move sideways on the bottom of the gamefield, climbing ladders, platforms and shooting harpoons that divide the moving targets into smaller, faster versions of themselves. Like in an arcade machine, the second player can join at any time.The game has three modes. World mode is the main game, where players go from level to level (50 total) of increasing difficulty, with five boss battles. Crazy mode has 50 expert levels for master players. Mania mode is the survival mode, where the levels are devoid of platforms and other obstacles and only have the bouncing target objects.Power-ups and bonus points drop from destroyed objects and can be collected from the field. Harpoon tips change the characteristics of the weapon, making it stick to the top or allowing several simultaneous shots. An alarm clock stops the movement of the objects, and a hourglass adds a few seconds to the timer.The gameplay is very similar to Dinosaur Balls.</plot>

  <plot>Most of the fundamentals of this game work in a similar way to Desert Strike. You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase. Before each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle&apos;s weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don&apos;t give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples)Missions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield.Unusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement. When you rotate the direction the ground moves underneath you, ensuring a more realistic effect and smartly mimicking motion effects.</plot>

You play one of many races, each with a special ability and special character traits, who set off to explore space, erect colonies (which can each have individual purposes, depending on their raw materials) and engage in battles when you clash with others who have the same goals. Weapons on the ships use power, which has to be supplied somehow.This game introduces many original concepts, such as the Research Tree - a special scientific display in which discoveries are depicted as icons connected by lines to the &quot;parent&quot; technological breakthroughs and &quot;child&quot; ones, similar to the technology advances in Civilization, but presented in a much more visual way.</plot>

New puzzles, new characters, and new investigations await as the player tracks Phil by his string of strangled corpses.All concepts and gameplay elements from Manhunter: New York return. The player again uses the MAD tracking device to follow suspects provided by the alien Orbs and uses clues found through first-person location investigation to discover the suspects&apos; name. Occasional arcade sequences bring mixed challenges, and though they cannot be skipped, a new difficulty option has been implemented.

  <plot>The 7th Guest is a puzzle-adventure game which takes place inside an abandoned mansion. Venture into the 22 rooms of the spooky mansion, solve over 20 mind-bending puzzles to unravel a tale of revenge and horror that took place in the 1930s.The owner of the mansion was Henry Stauf, a famous maker of children&apos;s toys. Once a homeless drifter and thief, influenced by a vision in a dream, Henry invented a wondrous doll, so incredibly life-like that it sold like wildfire. Stauf&apos;s toys became popular overnight bringing fame and fortune and changing his rags to riches. But things took a tragic turn when owners of the doll became infected with a fierce and deadly virus. None of those children recovered.After this turn of events Stauf secluded himself inside his estate, stopped making his toys and never came into contact with the outside world for a long time. Something very strange happened when six people receive an invitation to a party at the mansion. By solving the riddles inside Stauf&apos;s &quot;fun house&quot;, you&apos;ll delve into the past to learn what happened to them, and the mysterious 7th guest, on that fateful night.The game is played in first person perspective with a point-and-click interface featuring horror-themed animated cursors (skeletons, bulging-eye skulls etc.). It is one of the first games to be released on the then-new CD-Rom media. The graphics are fully rendered in SVGA, and real actors and actresses bring the story to life during numerous full-motion video cut scenes. The visuals are accompanied by an original, orchestrated musical score.To finish the game, you must solve the puzzles in Stauf&apos;s manor; each solved puzzle will unlock new rooms or new movie sequences to watch. The puzzles are quite varied; there&apos;s the classic &quot;eight queens puzzle&quot;, another puzzle where you need to compose a sentence by rearranging letters, and others. If you get stuck, you can visit the library; a book within will give you hints on the puzzle. If the hints aren&apos;t enough, the puzzle will solve itself automatically once you consult the book enough times. Some later, limited releases of the game came with a separate video that included a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look at the making of the game and interviews with the developers.</plot>

As Richard Gray, a young captain, you have to master ship navigation, sword fighting, trading, sea and land warfare and crew recruiting in order to progress in what begins as a simple story but becomes quite complicated : the plot involves many characters and there are a few twists and turns.This games features many different weapons (cannons as well as rifles and swords) and goods to trade. Managing your ships is much more complex than in Pirates! but the interface is nice and clear. The colonies buildings include a tavern, a governor house, an armory but also a church, which allows you to save your game.One of the most important things in this game is sea warfare. Sea Legends incorporates a 3D voxel engine which was quite impressive for the time and makes combats very realistic (although rather difficult to control).Globally, Sea Legends really is Pirates! with more options, 3D sea combats and a more detailed story.</plot>

  <plot>Waylon Smithers has just stolen a diamond from Springfield Jewelers for Mr. Burns. While trying to make a getaway he crashes into Homer, causing the diamond to leave Smithers&apos; hand and it flies into Maggie&apos;s mouth, prompting Smithers to grab Maggie (and with her, the diamond) and run off. The Simpsons decide to go after him, but Mr. Burns has tons of his henchmen to prevent the Simpsons family from getting their daughter back.The game is a conversion from the arcade game. It&apos;s basically a side scrolling four player beat-em-up featuring the Simpsons characters. The player can choose to play as one of the four Simpson&apos;s characters. Homer, who punches and kicks; Marge, who swings her vacuum cleaner; Bart, who wields his skateboard; and Lisa, who uses a jump rope like a whip.

The game&apos;s levels are Downtown Springfield, Krustyland, Springfield Discount Cemetery, Moe&apos;s Tavern, Springfield Gorge, Dreamland, the Channel 6 studio, and the Power Plant. Each level ends with a boss whose speed and strength would increase after taking a set amount of damage. End level bosses include the wrestler Professor Werner von Brawn, a hot air balloon shaped like Krusty the Clown, a pair of bouncers, a drunk at Moe&apos;s Tavern, a henchman in a bear suit, an imaginary gigantic bowling ball, and a martial arts sensei dressed like a kabuki actor. Of course there&apos;s also the showdown finale against Smithers and Mr. Burns in a robotic outfit.There are also 2 minigames between between levels where the player can compete against the other characters to be the first to inflate a balloon or to be the first to wake up their character.</plot>

  <plot>Typhoon of Steel is a tactical level simulation of small unit actions during WWII. It is a sequel to the best selling Panzer Strike and the rules are very similar. Three theaters are covered: the Pacific Theater (Americans vs Japanese), the Asian Theater (British vs Japanese) and European Theater action involving American vs German troops. Typhoon of Steel includes practically every ground weapon used by the combatants in this theater (over 220 weapon types). Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like Panzer Strike, the gameplay is considered to be advanced level.</plot>

Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens, who together with him escapes from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is concealed behind what looks like a typical platform shooter. The gameplay is based mainly on physical and environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a different strategy, and often there is only one way to solve the problem. Typically, enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the gun can be used to create a shield from behind which you can safely fire. The game is divided into levels, each one of which can be accessed by typing a code you learn after having completed the level. If you die (which is often) you restart the level anew. The game features vector graphics and animated cut scenes.</plot>

  <plot>On December 16, 1944 in the twilight of the Third Reich, Hitler played his last desperate gamble and launched a massive surprise assault against the thin allied lines in the Ardennes forest of Belgium and Luxemborg. As the German Commander your goal is to cross the Ardennes forest and get to the other side of the Meuse River. With division/regiment sized forces you must storm thru the allied forces taking as many towns as possible. If you choose to command the allied forces your goal is the same as the American commander in 1944. Hold out against the attacking germans until reinforcements arrive while keeping the enemy from taking towns and exiting from the map. The game lasts 15 turns. Each turn historically representing one day. The game can be played solitaire or against another individual.</plot>

  <plot>What is the game called? Amaze! What&apos;s in it? A maze! Now that we&apos;ve got that taken care of...Due to unexplained factors, our protagonist, a roguelike yellow happy face, has found him or herself stranded in the middle of large, multi-segmented textmode labyrinth (each segment coincidentally about the size of one metric computer screen, decorated with a different colour scheme and using different characters as obstacles), filled with endlessly re-spawning enemies (red faces), finite ammunition refills, health bonuses and abstract dangers only hinted at through the use of arcane ASCII symbols one can&apos;t even name. Sometimes messages spelled out plainly in the room layout address the player directly. The enemies carry on their own routine in realtime, Kroz-style, so the hero may as well move along at a brisk pace in search of the maze&apos;s exit... supposing that there even is one.The game was later (but not too much longer -- same year of release) gussied up with extra flashes and bleeps and a new introductory scroller and distributed in crippled shareware form as Insanity, boasting new, unfamiliar messages among the traditional map lay-outs, and hinting at adventure-game puzzle-solving through the inclusion of new objects in the maps. Since this version boots the player after a single death, it is difficult to track further changes.</plot>

  <plot>The Elder Scrolls: Arena is a first-person action role-playing game, in which you must rescue the Emperor Uriel Septim VII from his dimensional prison by recovering the eight pieces of the Staff of Chaos. The emperor&apos;s position has been usurped by impersonator Jagar Tharn whose slain apprentice rallies the player in his dreams to find the eight pieces of the staff and return the status quo.It is the first chapter in the Elder Scrolls series and the first game that is set in the fictional world of Tamriel. Unlike later games in the series the player can travel through almost all of Tamriel, instead of being restricted to certain provinces. There are over 400 cities, towns and villages to explore, tons of magical items and heaps of spells to create. The player can walk endlessly in any direction as more and more land will be procedurally generated. Walking manually however never allows the player to reach other cities; the fast travel feature must be used for this. The player is free to go where he or she wants. The story itself is resolved in a linear fashion, although the locations of items is randomly determined at the start of the game.Melee combat is performed through mouse gestures and spells are cast using a menu interface. The player controls only a single character, which happens in real-time. In the wild and in dungeons the player can expect opposition from enemies which need to be defeated and who drop loot. In the cities NPCs can be found, some will barter or provide other services to the player.The CD-ROM release features speech in cutscenes and additional rendered sequences that the floppy version does not include.</plot>

A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them. Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</plot>

  <plot>Finally the champion long awaited by the Goddess Danu, has arrived. The people of the island of Eire (Ireland) have long suffered from the curses the evil Formors and their leader Balor, thus are in need of a High King to unite the scattered tribes.To accomplish this, the player will descend from the heavens to Eire and pick a guise from 9 champions available. Gain respect of the other tribes of Eire through diplomacy and war. Unite them to become High King of Eire and finally defeat Balor once and for all!Celtic Tales: Balor of the Evil Eye is an isometric turn-based strategy game with various character development elements. Gameplay of this game may be identified as the following:1. Province DevelopmentTo create a strong army, the player must first create a strong home. The game starts with the player&apos;s province as the main screen. Numbers on the screen indicate how strong or how many provincial elements they have. The player can also access the Fortress and Settlement menus from here. Here the province may be developed by own heroes through the following activities:Farm: To provide grain during autumn harvest; Cowherd: To breed and maintain cattle, an invaluable trade resource in Eire;Mine: Mine rocks to obtain metal used for building and item creation;Chop: Chopping down trees will provide wood for building and item creation. Character and Hero DevelopmentThe role-playing game (RPG) elements of the game start here. A hero comes with a unique portrait, class, statistics, inventory (one item per hero), and skill proficiencies. The land of Eire comes with a unique set of 3 different character classes: The Warrior, the Bard, and the Druid. Only Bards and Druids may cast spells. Spells are used and obtained by using specific orders of runes. Assigning Heroes on specific tasks may lead them to acquire certain skills than allow them to become better in certain roles.Diplomacy and TradeThe Fortress and the Settlement areas allow the player to conduct diplomacy and barter agreements. In the Fortress section, the player may conduct tributes to open first-contact diplomatic channels with other tribes and further increase relationships by doing so, or may also attack (war) or attempt a cattle raid on neighboring provinces. In the Settlement section, the player may move heroes and resources to another province, send caravans, and resources for barter as well as create unique items through their heroes.WarWar occurs when the player invades or is invaded by enemy heroes. Diplomatic ties are automatically broken when an invasion commences. A maximum of 7 heroes may attack or defend a province. The defending army has the option before-hand to defend or to flee. Fleeing armies takes with them a portion of the province resources. An attack ends when either:The enemy leader is captured or is killed;The enemy routes;The attacking enemy stays too long, thus must retreat.The winning army then decides the fate of the captured heroes (if any).</plot>

Adventure, in which the three tables are connected; arcade, which is the traditional style allowing you to select any of the three tables; and bonus, allowing you to play the six bonus stages.While the Arcade and Bonus modes require no explanation, the adventure mode does.

  <plot>Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin&apos;s earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.</plot>

  <plot>Oil Barons is a turn based strategy game for one to eight players. The object of the game is to accumulate the most wealth by locating and drilling for oil. During the game you will need to survey different lands ranging from the arctic to the desert for oil potential, choose the best sites and drill! Congress may pass bills from time to time which forbid drilling in parks and other reserved lands, which may or may not affect a players strategy. Several modes of gameplay are featured, including regular classic, reality mode (oil locations are more randomized at the beginning of the game, and costs are supposed to more closely resemble those in real life), and customized modes. Included with the game is a game board with a 50x40 grid of the landscapes you can drill in, and dozens of game pieces to keep track of which locations belong to a player and where oil has (or has not) been discovered. This makes Oil Barons resemble a board game, but with a computer to do the bookkeeping and add a random element instead of dice.</plot>

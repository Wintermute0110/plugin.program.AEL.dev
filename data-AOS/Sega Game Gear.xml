There is a single-player mode that follows the story of protagonist Harimanada, as well as a versus mode for one or two players where any of 15 characters can be used.</plot>

As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons.&amp;#xA;There are three main modes:&amp;#xA;1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps.&amp;#xA;2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently.&amp;#xA;3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).&amp;#xA;While each mode presents it&apos;s own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers.

  <plot>Beavis and Butt-Head want to go to a GWAR concert, but they do not have the money for the tickets. Thus the infamous duo sets out to search the whole town for enough cash. The game is basically a jump&apos;n&apos;run game and cannot be called platformer, since the are no platform. All stages consist solely of one linear floor. The main goal of each stage is just to get from left to right. However, at one point in the game, you reach a ticket counter, and you cannot proceed if you do not have enough money to buy the concert tickets. So apart from reaching the exit, each stage must be searched for money, which both lies around and is contained in lockers, dustbins, coin-operated telephones and other things. Sometimes, even primitive puzzles must solved, e.g. by picking up books and selling them in the book shop. The stages are filled with all kinds of life decreasing obstacles, mostly bombs, moving objects or vermin. Beavis and Butt-Head have no means of attacking or defending, so everything must be evaded. The player controls only Butt-Head, Beavis is just following and will do any action delayed. However, if any one of the two is hit, you loose energy (which can be restored by picking up food). Possible actions are running, jumping, ducking, picking up items and interacting with the object in the background (if possible).</plot>

  <plot>The Berlinwall is the Game Gear version of the arcade game The Berlinwall. While the gameplay mechanics are identical, there are some significant changes. Foremost, the game adds a story: the player takes the role of a boy who searches for his mother who wanted to visit a neighbour town. Unfortunately, the only thing he finds is a huge wall. When trying to sneak through a hole, he is transported to a strange, hostile place... Each level (one non-scrolling screen) consists of several platforms which are interconnected with ladders. Another thing which is found in the levels are monsters which walk around and try to catch and kill the main character. His only way of defense is the hammer which is used to punch holes in the platforms: when monsters walk over them, they get stuck. When using the hammer on those trapped monsters, the platform is filled up again, the monster falls down and is killed. There are two added benefits: a falling monsters is deadly to other monsters and it leaves a power-up behind, e.g. an extension of the time limit or a stronger hammer.. Sometimes the player encounters boss monsters which require a bigger hole. While some levels are based on the arcade version, others are different. This version also adds a shop where the player can buy power-ups. It can be visited before taking on the world&apos;s boss.</plot>

Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics.&amp;#xA;To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch.&amp;#xA;Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey&apos;s ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.</plot>

  <plot>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up &apos;combos&apos; - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.&amp;#xA;As well as the normal game mode, there is also a &apos;flash&apos; mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</plot>

However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.&amp;#xA;Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: &quot;battle&quot; (attack), &quot;retreat&quot;, &quot;spell&quot; and &quot;monster&quot;. While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the &quot;monster&quot; command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.&amp;#xA;In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.</plot>

Players control Daffy Duck, who is hired to reacquire Yosemite Sam&apos;s Golden Cartoon Movie Awards, stolen by the nefarious Doctor Duck Brain. Daffy has to make his way through six different worlds of three levels each. Each world is based on a movie genre including western, horror, adventure, sci-fi and more. At the beginning of the game, the six levels of the first two worlds can be selected in any order. Completing all six unlocks the levels of the next two worlds. Each level consists of several sections. The entry to the next section only opens once Daffy has dispatched a number of enemies in the current section. To to so, Daffy is armed with a bubble gun. Shooting bubbles at enemies makes most of them float away, some however are invulnerable and must be avoided. Daffy can upgrade his gun via bubble power-ups, making it shoot faster, in different patterns or with more power. Also available are magic wand power-ups which summon a &quot;fairy duck mother&quot;, preventing Daffy from losing a life by absorbing the next hit - otherwise, each hit is instantly fatal. Golden clipboards give continues while dollar signs, gold coins and diamonds can be collected for points. Not every level contains one of the Movie Awards, and collecting them isn&apos;t even necessary to finish the game. Yosemite Sam won&apos;t be pleased however if not all are recovered.</plot>

  <plot>Evander Holyfield&apos;s &quot;Real Deal&quot; Boxing is a boxing simulation. Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson&apos;s Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent&apos;s point of view (&quot;through his eyes&quot;).&amp;#xA;Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter&apos;s head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.&amp;#xA;The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).</plot>

Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a limited amount of time.

Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in &quot;Switch Mode&quot;: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in &quot;Bridge Mode&quot;: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.&amp;#xA;If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.</plot>

  <plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football&apos;s world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &quot;isometric&quot;) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.&amp;#xA;Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>

The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve). Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that &quot;wiggle&quot; their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical &quot;eggs&quot; and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</plot>

  <plot>The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman&apos;s KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James &apos;Buster&apos; Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.&amp;#xA;Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury&apos;s points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.&amp;#xA;Each match the player&apos;s boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.</plot>

  <plot>In the first installment of the Aleste series for the GG, you play as Ellinor Waisen, the daughter of the original Aleste pilot Ray Waisen.&amp;#xA;As usual, your task is to exterminate level upon level of nasties with your space ship. The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon. On the other hand, secondary weapon upgrades are no longer released from ground bases, but from another type of flying pods. When you start out, your secondary weapon is a laser, which can later be replaced with powerups ranging from split fire to napalm rockets and target seeking power balls. Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once. Due to the smaller screen estate of the Game Gear, the sprites are larger and the playfield more constrained, for which the game compensates somewhat by introducing multidirectionally scrolling sections.</plot>

  <plot>Head Buster is a so-called &quot;future sports&quot; game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.&amp;#xA;Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.&amp;#xA;Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.</plot>

The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen where the player can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done in full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours). More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it will default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected receiver.

  <plot>Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name. The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.&amp;#xA;The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence. Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</plot>

Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.&amp;#xA;After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.&amp;#xA;The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.</plot>

  <plot>The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the original version released 5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and Sega&apos;s taste in motifs.&amp;#xA;As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.&amp;#xA;The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:&amp;#xA;Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.</plot>

In present time, this demon spirit, called Zenki, appears again, after having been sealed in a column by Enno Ozuno - Zenki was freed by Ozuno&apos;s descendant in present day, a school girl called Chiaki Enno. However, Zenki has only the form of an ill-mannered child, and Chiaki can only transform him into a useful form by using a magic bracelet. Together, Zenki and Chiaki must avert the threat caused by the seeds of Karuma, who started to appear and transform people into monsters. The game is a platformer which lets you control either Chiaki or Zenki, which both have different abilities. While Chiaki can break stones with her powers to clear the way and look for power ups, Zenki has spinning attack. Like in Sega&apos;s Astérix games, you choose at the beginning of each level which character to play. Further, the level can be left to pick the other one. For boss fights, the game switches to a different mode reminiscent of one-on-one fighting games, where Zenki faces the opponent in a more powerful form.</plot>

  <plot>The sequel to Lemmings has a plot describing how the Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces. Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment. Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.</plot>

  <plot>The Game Gear received a unique adaptation of the 1997 dinosaur sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It is primarily a side-scrolling platform game but also includes some other gameplay elements. Players control a hunter who, armed with a stun rifle and having enlisted the the help of a friendly Procompsognathus (&quot;Compy&quot;), must make his way through various levels on Isla Sorna to finally reach a helicopter and escape. The next level to be played can be chosen on an overview map of the island, allowing for some freedom regarding level order. In the standard platform levels, the goal is simply to reach the exit. Various dinosaurs must be avoided or taken out with the gun and environmental dangers like sand pits, rock avalanches and water holes must also be mastered. The gun&apos;s ammunition is unlimited and the hunter can take several hits before losing a life - his health is indicated by the color of his shirt. Replacement body armor is available as a power-up. In one of the levels, players don&apos;t control the hunter but Compy instead. Compy can only take one hit before losing a life, and instead of a gun, he has a jump attack. He also has the ability to climb walls. After most platform levels, a boss fight against an especially large and/or dangerous dinosaur follows, each attacking in a certain pattern requiring its own strategy to defeat. Variety from the standard platforming comes in a level where a raging Triceratops attacks from the left and the hunter must run for his life through the automatically-scrolling landscape. The final escape from the island takes place in a car, seen from the front (i.e. driving towards the screen), with a T. Rex attacking from behind. Both the dinosaur&apos;s attacks as well as obstacles on the road (like boulders and water puddles) must be avoided to reach the goal.</plot>

  <plot>The Majors: Pro Baseball is a baseball game for one or two players. It features an MLBPA but no MLB license, so has the full roster of players for the 26 teams of the 1991 MLB season, but with generic team names. Exhibition games (for either one or two players via Gear-to-Gear cable) and a full season (one player only) of either 32, 71 or 162 games are available. Three different stadiums (open, astroturf, dome) are available for selection and game length can be set from 3 to 9 innings. Before the game, starting pitcher and batter line-up can be selected from the team roster. Gameplay itself follows the standard model of the time: players control pitching, batting, running and fielding, with pitching/batting seen from a view behind the batter and running/fielding seen from an overhead view of the field. The game supports various pitching styles, bunts, holding runners on, lead offs and steals. The game also allows for players to create their own teams from all available players. Two team slots are available. Teams and season progress are saved to battery-backed RAM.</plot>

  <plot>If you&apos;re bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.&amp;#xA;These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.&amp;#xA;Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.&amp;#xA;The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</plot>

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now.

  <plot>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu&apos;s father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.&amp;#xA;Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.&amp;#xA;Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.</plot>

  <plot>The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.&amp;#xA;Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It&apos;s possible to watch the other semi-final.&amp;#xA;Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.&amp;#xA;The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it&apos;s own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).</plot>

  <plot>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It&apos;s an ordinary evening, and Bruno&apos;s dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno&apos;s vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father&apos;s pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it&apos;s up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids&apos; eyes - and rescue his dad!&amp;#xA;The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno&apos;s primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno&apos;s special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.&amp;#xA;Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno&apos;s score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</plot>

  <plot>Based on Namco&apos;s Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.&amp;#xA;The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man&apos;s directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a &quot;wall&quot; on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.&amp;#xA;Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It&apos;s similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.&amp;#xA;The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man&apos;s direction with the press of a button.&amp;#xA;All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</plot>

The basic way to do this is to shoot them, but there are various obstacles which need to be circumvented, e.g. mirrors which reflect shots; the direction is indicated by small arrows on the floor. Destructible blocks are distinguished by their colour, for example a purple block becomes blue when shot once and vaporizes after the next. Enemies are also capable of destroying blocks. Reflected own and enemy shots (along with mines on the floor) can kill the space ship, but extra lives can be earned by collecting power ups. One speciality is that the player can change the position of the gun; either left, right or central.</plot>

  <plot>Though it shares its Western title with the Master System shooter, GG Aleste II takes place in the far future, and not the steam-punk 1930s of Powerstrike II for the Master System. As in GG Aleste, you&apos;re the woman pilot of a space fighter faced with the task of saving the world by destroying a lot of alien spaceships and technological plantlife.&amp;#xA;The gameplay in GG Aleste II has been further refined since its predecessor. Before starting out, you&apos;re given the choice between all the secondary weapons, with suggestive names such as Hammer Hawk or Rising Masher. These are upgraded in the same vein as in GG Aleste until you reach a frightening potential, covering the screen in bullets and napalm explosions. As a last resort, you&apos;re also given the ultimate weapon; a smart bomb destroying all enemies on-screen. Unfortunately, you&apos;re only given one bomb per life. As far as the weapons arsenal goes, this is the pinnacle in 8-bit Aleste versions. The graphics have been revised with a clearer look which turns out better on the Game Gear&apos;s fuzzy screen.&amp;#xA;Perhaps taking a cue from the Sonic games of the time, the bonus levels are in 3-D, giving you the chance to earn bonus points and extra lives by shooting down as many baddies as possible in Galaxy Force style.</plot>

All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.&amp;#xA;By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage.

  <plot>Your name is Kevin Codner - rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and &quot;shipsmarts&quot;. In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can&apos;t use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever. There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane. Each level has a certain &quot;save limit&quot;, meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you&apos;d better be on time with some assistance. At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.</plot>

The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account. The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one &apos;professional foul&apos; (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.</plot>

Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it&apos;s possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.</plot>

  <plot>Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon.&amp;#xA;The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.&amp;#xA;On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.&amp;#xA;Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.&amp;#xA;The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don&apos;t always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.</plot>

  <plot>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate &quot;address&quot; along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.&amp;#xA;There are two game modes building on this basic concept:&amp;#xA;1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.&amp;#xA;Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent&apos;s side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</plot>

Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.&amp;#xA;Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature &quot;death drops&quot; where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</plot>

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.&amp;#xA;Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.&amp;#xA;T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.&amp;#xA;Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000.

  <plot>Before Tails met Sonic the Hedgehog he lived on Cocoa Island, a place that isn&apos;t on the map. It&apos;s an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it&apos;s coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it&apos;s power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.&amp;#xA;Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.</plot>

  <plot>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it&apos;s own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.&amp;#xA;The gameplay can be tweaked for the players&apos; preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.&amp;#xA;Graphically, the game is similar to EA&apos;s Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field.&amp;#xA;The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker&apos; 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</plot>

  <plot>Wheel of Fortune: featuring Vanna White is one of a series games based on the famous TV game show. The goal is to solve a word puzzle by guessing letters. The players take turns spinning a wheel that has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player in the wheel lands on the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player&apos;s earnings.&amp;#xA;This NES edition of the game allows 1, 2, or 3 human players to play against each other. Human players can also elect to play against computer players and at 3 difficulty levels.&amp;#xA;The Vanna White Edition differs from previous Wheel of Fortune games on the NES in that it actually bears the likeness of Vanna White. Also, there are avatars for the player contestants, and the wheel animation is different.</plot>

To regain your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land.&amp;#xA;In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you have the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes.&amp;#xA;The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas.

  <plot>Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito&apos;s Arkanoid. Sega&apos;s answer was called Woody Pop.&amp;#xA;With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit &quot;mystery bricks&quot;, wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind - instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.&amp;#xA;Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.&amp;#xA;Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the &quot;diamond ball&quot;, which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.</plot>

His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world. While the first game was a side-scrolling beat &apos;em up featuring four characters from the manga, the second game is a one-on-one fighting game. The game though does take a different approach than games like Street Fighter, as you do not control the movement of your character, as both opponents stand still. You fight by pressing a combination of buttons to make your character perform a certain attack. The efficiency of the attack depends on two factors: The position of a moving cross-hair on the body of your opponent, which determines the spot you attack, and the amount of energy in a displayed &quot;move gauge&quot; which increases over the time. To perform a special attack, you also need a certain amount of Ki energy which is displayed in another gauge. The Ki regenerates while it&apos;s not used further, and without Ki a player is limited to only normal attacks. The triggered attacks are then displayed in an anime style animation sequence showing both opponents doing their corresponding move. In single player mode (a two-player mode is available via linking two Game Gears), one may either play a tournament or single fight against a character of one&apos; choice. However, not all fighters are accessible from the beginning (the single combat mode also starts with one character less than the tournament mode) and must be unlocked by progressing in the game (progress is saved with passwords). Altogether, there are seven characters to choose from: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Itsuki, Toguro and Sensui Shinobu.</plot>

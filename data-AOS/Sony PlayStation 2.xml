  <plot>Building on 007: Everything or Nothing&apos;s range of strengths, 007: From Russia with Love is based on the 1963 film starring Sean Connery as James Bond. He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova. However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus. It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb.&amp;#xA;In most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences.&amp;#xA;The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things: bonus content like making of videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only once.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the scripts of the 21st movie &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and the 22nd James Bond movie of the same name as the game, it follows closely the story of those movies but elaborates many scenes and fills in some blanks.&amp;#xA;In a first person shooter fashion, the player directs Bond through the levels filled with many bad guys. To overcome those, Bond has several different kinds of weapons at his disposal ranging from his trusted P99, over machine guns to full blown grenade launchers. But the levels are also filled with canisters that either explode upon shooting or vent gas that temporarily blinds the enemy. Bond can also perform a take down move which puts an enemy out silently. If Bond is near enough to an enemy, a button press will initiate the corresponding mini-game in which the player needs to hit a circle with a crosshair in a short period of time. Is the player successful, the enemy is out of the play but when he fails to hit the mark in time, Bond will be thrown away from the enemy and is vulnerable for a short period of time. In addition Bond can duck into cover to avoid bullets and shoot blindly over it or look out of it to get the kill. Bond also automatically regenerates his health when not under fire.&amp;#xA;Other obstacles in the levels are cameras, which can either be shot or disabled and electronic locks which need to be hacked in another mini-game. There arrows flash green or red on the screen and the player needs to press the corresponding button fast enough when it blink green to input the right number into the keypad.&amp;#xA;The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players with the following game modes:&amp;#xA;1. Bond Versus: one player takes over the control of James Bond and either needs to defuse two of the three bombs in the level or kill all six of the opposing team. In this mode Bond can also see all enemies and has two lives.&amp;#xA;2. Golden Gun: the first player to score 100 points wins the round. Points are earned by kills but if the player is holding the always visible power weapon called &quot;Golden Gun&quot;, he scores 6 points per kill.&amp;#xA;3. Bond Evasion: in this mode one member of the MI6-team randomly gets to be Bond and needs to get to the escape point of the map to win the round for his team. Meanwhile The Organization tries to stop him by either killing him or preventing him to reach the escape points in time.</plot>

  <plot>Crow is a hitman who lives in Ireland. His mother was a fortune teller who possessed mysterious powers and was killed when Crow was very young. The boy was adopted by a mob boss known as Papa Tonia. Crow inherited from his mother a unique ability to slow down time, which he trained to become a feared assassin. However, his main goal in life is to find who killed his mother, and exact his revenge. 10.000 Bullets is a 3D third-person shooter. The player controls Crow as well as three other characters during the course of the game. The slowdown ability is similar to the bullet time effect used in Max Payne, but can be eventually upgraded so that the player character himself can move at normal speed while everything around him freezes. Killing several enemies in close succession awards the player bonus points, which can be used between levels to upgrade the protagonist&apos;s health as well as teach him special offensive and evasive manoeuvres. There are also short adventure-like sequences requiring the player to talk to characters to advance the plot.</plot>

  <plot>Fifteen years ago, the The Belkan Federation began a war of conquest, invading nearby territories. To stop them, a military alliance was set up between the Osean Federation and the Union of Yuktobanian Republics. These two great powers drove the Belkans back but their counter-invasion was cut short when the Belkans detonated 6 nuclear warheads on their own soil, preventing the alliance from advancing on them. This ended the great war and a time of peace has reigned. The Osean and Yuktobanian nations have remained allies. On the small remote, &quot;Sand Island&quot;, off the western coast of Osea, a skilled veteran of the war named Captain Bartlett (callsign: &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;) trains new pilots as the 108th Tactical Fighter Squadron, designated &quot;Wardog&quot; in the Osean Air Defense Force (OADF). During a routine training operation, unidentified aircraft appear on the radar and proceed to shoot down many of the squadron&apos;s not fully trained pilots. The squadron is left with few survivors, and the incident covered up while the military tries to figure out what&apos;s going on. Soon after, the nation of Yuktobania declares war on Osea, thus beginning a new conflict.&amp;#xA;Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War is a first person air combat and flight simulator. Like other Ace Combat games, each mission is determined by a level briefing and objectives. There are 32 missions in the main campaign mode, while an additional &quot;arcade&quot; mode puts the player in the role of Mobius One (from Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies) as he faces endless waves of enemy attacks. Regardless of the mode chosen, once in the air the player will have control over speed, direction, altitude, gun cannon, missiles and special weapon of their aircraft. A new feature from previous Ace Combat games, is the concept of Wingmen and being able to issue simple orders to them in the air. This allows the player to better coordinated group attacks as well as giving each wingman a personality of their own. Additionally, the player as squadron leader will be asked to make decisions (&quot;Yes/No&quot;) while flying in the air. Between missions, the story is progressed through a series of cutscenes.&amp;#xA;Successful destruction of enemy targets earns the player money, which can be used to purchase new aircraft. Unlike Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies special weapons no longer need to be purchased, however airplanes in the inventory apply to the entire squadron so if the player wishes a full wing of F-16s, they must have enough for everyone to fly.&amp;#xA;Ace Combat 5, though situated in a fictional world highlights real-world models of aircraft including the F-14 Tomcat, Su-27 Flanker, F-16, A-6 Intruder, A-10 Thunderbolt, F-15, F/A-18, Tornado, and many more.</plot>

The missions can be anything done airborne, and there&apos;ll be escort, assault and defence missions amongst others.&amp;#xA;Like in the previous games, the game isn&apos;t about simulation, but fast paced aerial combat in highly powered aircraft.&amp;#xA;More like Top Gun, and less like real world.&amp;#xA;There are 30 licensed fighter jets to choose from, and as a new gimmick, there is &quot;Ace Style&quot; -meter which determines the story as the player see&apos;s fit. The player can choose to only take out intended targets and be considered a &quot;knight&quot;, take out military targets and minimal civilian causalities for a &quot;soldier&quot; ranking or be considered a &quot;mercenary&quot; where the player can take out damaged aircraft and mass destruction of civilian causalities. As the player plays the game over, the game will adjust to their style, depending on their style the game can send out new and more dangerous squadrons to try and stop the player at any cost.</plot>

  <plot>Action Girlz Racing is a kart racing game with a cast of eight girls racing in miniature cars. The gameplay is very similar to the contemporary Myth Makers: Super Kart GP by the same developer. The three game modes are single trial, time trial and grand prix. There are three difficulty levels (beginner, experienced and advanced) and three racing classes (50 cc, 100 cc and 150 cc). The game includes environments such as a fairytale castle, sunset lagoon, action girlz high, dolphin bay resort and aquacoral resort. As with many of the developer&apos;s games most of the content is locked from the start. Most characters, tracks and race classes become available after collecting a number of flowers during races as a currency. The different characters only differ in appearance, not in abilities. While racing it is possible to bump into other racers and the tracks contain many obstacles that slow down the racers or can be knocked around. Eight types of power-ups can be picked up such as nitro, an umbrella shield, shooting opponents or stunning them. Power-ups can be doubled or maxed out by collecting diamonds. Tracks often have branching paths, but instead of offering alternative routes or short-cuts, they often lead to dead ends, forcing the racer to backtrack. The Wii version supports local split-screen multiplayer games for up to four players. The karts are controlled through motion by holding the Wii Remote horizontally and then tilting left or right. The PS2 version supports split-screen games for two players and up to four players through Multi-Tap.</plot>

This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress.

There are overall 35 levels.&amp;#xA;It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once.

  <plot>In this tennis game with the endorsement of former world no. 1 Andre Agassi, the player has 32 players (all male, of which Agassi is the only real player), every one with their own strengths and 16 tournaments around the world, each with their trademark court (so you can count on Carpet in St. Petersburg, Grass on London, Clay in Paris and Cement on New York). Three game modes are available: Quick game (a simple game where the players sets all options, from location to the participants), Arcade (beating a series of games in a row) and Agassi Tournament, where the player competes for the No. 1 spot.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is simple, as usual in most tennis matches. There are four buttons, controlling a simple shot, lob, top and back spin, and to win points, the player must be positioned correctly and add the right amount of direction and strength into the shot (by moving the d-pad). Serving uses a power bar where the player presses a key to toss the ball, and the bar fills up as the best time to hit the ball approaches, when the player hits the button again. Like in Virtua Tennis there are two views, the usual TV camera and a &quot;behind the player&quot; camera. Unlike other games published by Cryo in the Roland Garros series, the camera does not change so that the player is always on the bottom court.</plot>

The training section is in the form of a manual and it not only explains the game&apos;s controls but also the workings of the helicopter and includes sections of video footage.</plot>

  <plot>Akira Psycho Ball is a pinball game based on the animated movie Akira (1988). The focus of the game is the story mode during which the player visits four stages (Neo-Tokyo, Laboratory, A-Room and Olympic Stadium) which are also divided into different tables. On each table, the player has to reach special objectives with the usual pinball mechanics, e.g. hitting certain things in the correct order. There are also optional secret rooms to find. After finishing all objectives, the next table is unlocked as well as a cutscene directly taken from the movie. The arcade mode is unlocked after finishing the story and allows the player to freely play the tables for highscores. The vs. mode (either against the AI or another human) is played on two tables which are divided in the middle, but are interconnected through a loop at the top. The main goal is to send as many balls as possible to the opponent&apos;s side because each lost ball gives a penalty point. The first player to reach a certain number loses the match.</plot>

Further skills such as Heart, Intimidation and Recovery can be developed to improve either car or driver. AI cars have the same features applied to them race by race. The driver&apos;s heartbeat is a featured sound effect, and in pressure situations it can be heard above all other sounds. One available skill is the Tiger Effect, which allows you to rewind the game to avoid dangerous situations as they are about to happen.

After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?&amp;#xA;Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.&amp;#xA;To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.&amp;#xA;The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot). The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special &quot;PDA Game&quot; with very simple-looking graphics. Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit. Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</plot>

  <plot>The PS2 and Wii versions of Alone in the Dark follow the same plot as the game developed for Xbox 360 and Windows by Eden Games, but were created by a different company with their own vision how the game should be implemented.&amp;#xA;Level structure, mechanics of gameplay, and looks of the characters (Sarah, especially) sometimes differ strongly as these versions contain concept elements that were left out of the other game. The driving sequences are almost entirely taken out. The first-person view is also mostly not used, and, for example, fire can be extinguished in the third-person mode. The basic aspects of screenplay are retained, but this can be considered another &quot;what if&quot; instalment in the series, rather than a canonical entry like the other version.

  <plot>Alpine Racer 3 is a downhill ski racing game. It is based on the arcade Alpine Racer series played on a cabinet where the player stands on a set of ski-like foot stands that are moved with horizontal motions to steer and taking corners while holding onto two bars for stability. This is the first game in the series made for a console system. The features and game modes are most likely not identical to the Alpine Racer 3 arcade game. A first for the series, it mixed skiing with snowboarding previously featured in the arcade game Alpine Surfer. The main game mode is the Extreme Winners Cup that features cross races, slalom, one-on-one and time attack. These largely serve to qualify for the tournaments. There are eight characters to choose from (one initially locked) and several courses. Each character has different statistics based on speed, turning and power. By winning races credits are earned to upgrade the snowboard and ski gear. Next to steering an additional button can be used to crouch and gain extra speed, but this limits movement. The same button is used in the air to perform tricks. The game can be played competitively against another player through a split-screen. Some of the equipment in the game comes from licensed manufacturers.</plot>

Every time you clear a part of the area, one of the areas on the bingo card is ticked off.&amp;#xA;A new training mode helps you improve your speed and accuracy, and of course there is a two player battle mode, for those who wish to prove they are Wetrix champions.</plot>

So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he&apos;s just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He&apos;s angry.&amp;#xA;The game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure.&amp;#xA;The game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.</plot>

  <plot>The story of Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia takes place in the world of Sol Ciel, a world consisting of two floating islands connected by the Tower of Ar tonelico. Long ago people had built up a great civilization under the guidance of the goddesses the Trio of Elemia, but over the years things have changed; there were two disasters that have lead towards the destruction of the world. In the first disaster most of the lands and skies were lost, in the second the super civilization was lost; now in the third era another disaster is beginning. Viruses born in the Altar of Apostles have begun to appear, though normally not in physical form have now taken on the form of monsters and could destroy the world. In the upper levels of the Tower is a city called Platina where the Knights of Elemia reside; their job is to control virus outbreaks to preserve the tower. One such knight is Lyner Barsett; the main character of the story, he will need to go on a quest to find the Hymn Crystal which can save the Tower of Ar tonelico and the whole world.&amp;#xA;Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia is an RPG style game where you control Lyner Barsett. As the game begins, your airship crashes in the lower world; you&apos;ll not only need to locate the Hymn Crystal somewhere in the lower world, but then figure out how to return to the upper levels of the tower! Gameplay features both an exploration mode and battle mode. When exploring you can wander around the many locations of Sol Ciel; you&apos;ll encounter numerous people to talk to, various towns and cities, as well as locate useful items. In many areas battles are randomly encountered; on the screen is a colored meter - beginning green, it slowly fades towards red. The closer to red the meter becomes, the greater your chances of randomly encountering a battle.&amp;#xA;Battles in the game are turn based; Lyner as well as other characters in your party each have the ability to perform attacks as well as utilize various skills. Throughout the game you will encounter several characters known as Reyvateils; Reyvateils have the unique ability to sing songs which can be crafted into powerful magic for attacking, healing, or defense. When a Reyvateil is in your party, she remains at the back during battles; you can give her commands on what songs to sing - the longer she sings, the more powerful the magic will become. However singing tires a Reyvateil, and if she sings for too long she becomes so tired the built up magic is lost so you need to make sure to give a command to activate the magic before that happens. Normally opponents don&apos;t attack a Reyvateil, only the characters on the front line. Occasionally though an enemy will target a Reyvateil; when this happens you need to make sure other characters protect her, for though Reyvateils can craft powerful magic they are mostly defenseless to enemy attacks! When all opponents in the battle have been defeated, the battle is won and points are earned which can level up your characters.&amp;#xA;Throughout the game you will need to help Reyvateils learn more powerful song magic. To do this you will need to dive into a Reyvateils cosmosphere. The cosmosphere is the world of her mind consisting of her private thoughts and emotions; when there you can interact with the Reyvateil and help her overcome obstacles to learn new songs. However since you are viewing her private thoughts, you first need to gain the trust of the Reyvateil. This is done by interacting in the real world first by talking; talk topics can be found in various locations throughout the world and also after various events. When you have enough talk topics completed you can then dive to the next level in the Reyvateils mind.&amp;#xA;Another important skill Lyner learns early on is Grathmelding; this allows you to combine various items to form new ones. To do so, you will first need to locate a recipe so you know what to combine as well as Grathnode crystal to aid the process. The required items can sometimes be bought in shops or may be found by exploring the world. The items you create may be necessary to get past certain obstacles, or can just help you out in battle.</plot>

  <plot>In the world of Ar Ciel, the Reyvateil region is being threatened by an epidemic that&apos;s been killing the citizens. A knight from the Grand Bell, Croix, is sent there to deal with the epidemic. The people of Metafalss, lead by the Grand Bell, rebel against the Goddess who controls the world, in order to achieve their dream and create a utopia by singing a Song in the Hymnos language, called Metafalica - as the legend says. Melody of Metafalica is an RPG, much like its predecessor, Melody of Elemia, that takes place one and a half years later. It is the second installment in the Ar tonelico series. The turn-based battle sequences from the random enemy encounters are split up into two phases. In the first one, Attack, the different characters can perform various attacks until a time gauge runs out. When there is a Reyvateil in the party, a member of the race who can wield magic by transforming sounds into energy, players can determine which magic to use and the moment to unleash it. In the second phase, Defend, enemies have the opportunity to attack and will target the (up to two) Reyvateil who are singing at the back of the party. The other characters must then defend by timing the defensive moves. The effectiveness of attacks is also often determined by how well the attacks are synced to the requests of the Reyvateil. The game is largely centered around female heroines and it contains a dive system where Croix can dive into the mind (Cosmospheres) of certain Reyvateils to get to know their feelings and emotions. That game element plays out with text-heavy dating-style elements where the choices can alter the storyline and it is also the system through which new Song Magic is crafted. Diving can only be done to the three main characters in the game and Croix needs to commit to one, it is not possible to hop between them. New &quot;evil&quot; Reyvateil can be converted by using the Dive system and afterwards they will contribute to the party. These are equipped through an additional item slot that affects a character through offensive or defensive means.</plot>

  <plot>Armored Core: Last Raven is a mech combat game, the pilots are called Ravens, and is set about half a year after the events of Armored Core: Nexus. The three major corporations merged into the Alliance in order to rule the world - but a new faction, Vertex, challenges them. Smaller, independent gangs of Ravens called Warlords have grown more aggressive which does not help matters. 24 hours before Vertex plans to unleash full war on the Alliance - which is thought to have devastating consequences for the world - the player enters the scene in the shoes of a new Raven who eventually has to choose a side and play a major role in the conflict... The game has a branching campaign structure and the progression depends on the player&apos;s choices. This leads to different missions to play and concludes in one of six endings. The missions, which are prefaced with voice-over briefings and emails to read, are action-oriented and straightforward; the player usually has to either defeat a number of enemies in the open, visit indoor levels or survive against a single, powerful Raven. The most important part is the mech customization in which the player can tune the performance of the robot and exchange parts. For the first time in the series, the outside parts (e.g. the head or the legs) have locational damage and can be destroyed during missions - for example, when an arm is destroyed the player can&apos;t use the equipped weapon anymore. Between story missions, the player can visit an arena and fight against other Ravens for training. The PSP version has a few additional parts.</plot>

  <plot>Arthur and the Invisibles: The Game is an action-adventure based on the mostly animated film from director Luc Besson who also wrote the children&apos;s books it originated from. It follows the film&apos;s storyline after the live-action part where a boy must save his grandmother&apos;s house from a greedy developer by finding a treasure that his grandfather went missing in searching for it in the magical land of the tiny Minimoy. When the boy Arthur enters a portal to their land, he shrinks in size and changes his appearance so he becomes like a Minimoy also. Arthur and his two friends, princess Selenia and her brother Bétamèche, try to save the Minimoys from certain destruction.&amp;#xA;There is a tutorial which teaches you movement and combat plus how to move objects and flip switches. The action begins when a Minimoy ceremony is interrupted by enemy mosquitoes. You have to alternately play as all the three characters and use the special abilities of each to fight, solve puzzles, fly and drive. Arthur can smash spiderwebs and climb, while Selenia can cut through foliage, and Betameche can crawl through small spaces and packs an upgradable projectile-based weapon. Defeating enemies that have special keys is necessary in order to open gates to progress in the game. In one scene, they ride a mosquito through a cavern while shooting other mosquitoes from the air. There are also racing sections. Scenes from the film move the story along from one set piece to another.</plot>

  <plot>In a future where fossil fuels are limited, major countries and forces of the world are at war with one another over territory. Alliances are made, forming two major sides: The Axis and The Federation. The elite units in these wars are Assault Suits, man-piloted combat mechs called Assault Suits. Jake is one such pilot, drafted into the Pacific States&apos; Marine Corp under the Federation. During his training, the war has grown substantially and upon being assigned to a platoon, he is immediately thrown into combat. Cybernator is a side scrolling mech combat game and platform game. The player controls Jake as he moves his assault suit left and right on the battlefield. The assault suit can jump and use a jetpack for a short time to increase altitude. The assault suit begins with a Shot machine gun weapon that spreads out fire in front, and a Punch weapon for close melee. Additional weapons can be found during the course of the game and existing weapons improved by the gathering of &quot;P&quot; power-ups left by defeated enemies. Each level contains a variety of enemies and an end boss which must be destroyed to reach the next level. Some levels take place as horizontally scrolling shooters, in which the Assault suit can move up, down, left and right on the screen, but is constantly advancing towards new threats. The PlayStation 2 version is not a straight port or emulation of the original SNES game. It has altered visuals and balance tweaks, as well as a brief new stage at the beginning.</plot>

  <plot>The story of Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny follows Viese and Felt, two orphans from the land of Eden. At the beginning of the story an earthquake has caused vast portions of the land to disappear! Viese and Felt have volunteered to find out what has happened and to prevent the world of Eden from being destroyed completely. With the aid of a magical sword called the Azure Azoth, Felt sets off through a gate to another world called Belkhyde to search for the answer to their trouble while Viesa remains in Eden to take care of things there.&amp;#xA;Throughout the game you control Viesa and Felt on their quest. Viesa has just become an alchemist; with the help of the Mana spirits of the world, this gives her the ability to take various items and magically form new items. In order to create a new item, Viesa will need a recipe indicating what ingredients to combine as well as those ingredients. All of these items can be found in various locations throughout the lands, some in Eden and some in Belkhyde. Many of the items Viesa can create with alchemy will be of great help to Felt as he explores Belkhyde and fights in battles; since Felt doesn&apos;t have the ability to create items, they will need the help of a share ring which provides the ability to exchange items even though they are in two different worlds. To progress through the game, Felt will often need to coordinate with Viesa to get useful items for either solving puzzles or making battles easier. As Felt explores Belkhyde, he will meet numerous other characters and will need to undergo various quests in order to save Eden.&amp;#xA;The battles in the game are turn based; there is a meter at the top of the screen showing each of the characters in the battle with the rightmost character having the next turn. On each turn players may choose one of several attack options. There are two basic types of attacks, break attacks which will send your opponents further left on the meter providing more time or an extra turn, and charge attacks which increase the skill meter. Each character also has special skills which can be used if you have enough points on the skill meter. Battles are encountered randomly; as you wander enemy infested areas, a meter on the screen begins blue in color and slowly fades to red; the closer to red the meter is, the greater your chances of encountering a random battle. As you defeat enemies, this meter will slowly drain; when the meter is empty, you have defeated all of the enemies in that area. As you win battles, experience points are earned allowing your characters to level up and become more powerful.&amp;#xA;As you progress through the game, the story will unfold. You can learn more about the land and what&apos;s going on by talking to the many people you&apos;ll find as well as through cut scenes at various points.</plot>

On the PlayStation 2, the game uses traditional button-based controls. On the Wii, the player can swing the Wiimote to bat and pitch. On the Nintendo DS, there are two control modes.

Power-ups can be activated when the power meter is filled up and give certain advantages, e.g. the &quot;split ball&quot; power-up for pitchers causes the ball to divide into two. There are various difficulty options which can be turned on or off like automatic fielding or deactivating bat aim (when activated, the player actively has to aim into the direction the ball is supposed to fly). The game modes are quick matches (also available for two players), a season mode with the ability to change the lineup and some statistics and two mini games (Home Run Derby and Fielder&apos;s Challenge which is basically fielding training).

  <plot>Band Hero is a karaoke/rhythm based game, similar to the Guitar Hero games, but directed at the pop loving teenage crowd, as well as a more group based party game (unlike with guitar hero, full band instruments are included from the beginning of the series).&amp;#xA;The instruments are the same as in the more recent GH games. You have the microphone for vocals, guitars for either lead or bass guitar and the drum kits for drumming along. Accordingly, each instrument has its own &apos;career&apos; path in game.&amp;#xA;If you are doing the vocals for your band, you have to sing along in time to the music, matching the pitch as closely as possible. Lead and bass guitar is played by holding down the fret buttons and strumming as the appropriate fret icons cross the strike line on screen. Drums are done similar to the guitars, hitting the correct drum pad&apos;s/cymbals at the correct time. The better you do, the more points you score, however if you make too many mistakes, you will fail the song.&amp;#xA;You can either play alone on any of the instrument careers, or you can play with up to three friends on one console or online to compete with other players and bands from across the world.&amp;#xA;Songs featured include Duran Duran&apos;s Rio, Don McLean&apos;s American Pie, Evanescence&apos;s Bring Me To Life and Queen&apos;s Crazy Little Thing Called Love.</plot>

  <plot>Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses is based on the 2006 direct-to-video animated movie of the same name and the story is loosely based on the fairy tale The Twelve Dancing Princesses. Barbie is cast as Genevieve, one of the twelve princesses who live with their windowed father King Randolph in a castle. They live a frivolous live, so Randolph brings over his cousin Duchess Rowena to raise them as proper princesses. She makes their lives miserable however and poisons the king, so they flee to a magical world brought to life through a story of their mother. Rowena traps them there, along with Genevieve&apos;s friend Derek, and they need to use a goblet to collect mystical water that can cure their father. The player controls Genevieve in a full 3D environment, but with a small amount of freedom and sometimes with brief branching. She can be moved in any direction and can jump while twirling, to complete platform sections or to avoid water that kills instantly. The game uses many moving platforms, elevators, gaps and platforms that disappear when she stands on them too long. There is no health system and she has an unlimited amount of lives, respawning right away at the last point. Along the way she can collect gems. She sometimes meets animals she can pet. There are many sections with short mini-games activated by walking into large, spinning coins. In one of them a cat is controlled in a game of Breakout, bouncing an apple to bring down leaves from a tree or using a water bubble. In another Genevieve needs to throw berries towards birds in a nest with a moving obstacle blocking the path. Another section offers a jigsaw puzzle that needs to be completed to open a door. Between gameplay sections there are many animated cut-scenes. After the initial section a hub is entered that leads to four different worlds where the eleven princesses can be found. They are eventually brought back to the central hub by assigning the correct gem to them. The hub levels contain more mini-games next to the main exploration. She needs to guide a water bubble to collect music notes, design a dance choreography and a water fountain show, follow dance instructions similar to the Dance Dance Revolution games, use a slingshot to get flowers on waterlilies, and create a rainbow by moving a cloud to collect colours while avoiding dark clouds. There is a falling block puzzle game where the colours of the rainbow need to be gathered by matching gems of an identical colour in a group of three, horizontally or vertically, while dark clouds appear and remove blocks. Many mini-games are often repeated multiple times for the different princesses.</plot>

Movement is accomplished with the WASD or arrow keys, while the mouse controls the camera angle. Other keys access your inventory and the map, allow you to aim and squirt milk at opponents (even when you play as a boy!), and confirm menu selections.&amp;#xA;The map is fairly large and there are plenty of things to do beyond the missions and quests your fellow animals assign you. There are places to explore, barrels to break, and minigames like whack-a-raccoon, bowling, and bicycle races.&amp;#xA;As you play, you need to keep up your stamina, which decreases as you run around the farm. A good sleep is important; you need to be rested to fight off marauding raccoons and coyotes. And do remember not to let the Farmer catch you standing on two feet!</plot>

Furthermore, the point of view has been changed from first person to third person and the gameplay has been modified accordingly to make the game more of an action-RPG than the original.</plot>

  <plot>Set 40 years before the Sci-Fi Channel&apos;s 2004 Battlestar Galactica miniseries, the game acts as a prequel to the events in the new series. Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.&amp;#xA;Missions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the Galactica. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and Galactica&apos;s war room. Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.&amp;#xA;Players control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full. Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.&amp;#xA;Missiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu. Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius. This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship&apos;s defenses.&amp;#xA;Though it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica. The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the Galactica itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.</plot>

  <plot>The Bigs 2 is an arcade-oriented baseball game. During matches, the player takes the role of the active player, e.g. the batter, and tries to make a successful move. Successful actions fill up a power meter and when it is full, the player can unleash powerful abilities: Big Blast (an automatic home run when hitting the ball as batter) or Big Heat (a power pitch). In contrast to the main console version, this version is more similar to the predecessor. The only change which has made its way into this version is the wheelhouse system which shows shows the high risk zones of each batter. Actually bringing a ball through these zones rewards a big hit to his overall effectiveness. The other additions like the Big Slam ability and new mini games are not present. The Become A Legend career mode is identical to the predecessor&apos;s Rookie Challenge.</plot>

Kain swears vengeance on the opponent who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as ruler of the vampires.&amp;#xA;The Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 is a 3rd person adventure game, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player controls from behind Kain&apos;s shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use &quot;dark gifts&quot; and grab on to ledges. Kain&apos;s life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform &quot;stealth kills&quot; which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar.&amp;#xA;The Serafan use Glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progress because of Glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph &quot;circuit&quot; in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down it&apos;s connection, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.</plot>

  <plot>Seduced by the power offered to him, a samurai allows harm to come to his infant son. The son, fated to destroy the 48 Fiends, has 48 body parts removed, one by each demon. The samurai sets the remains adrift along a river, where the still-living child is discovered by a kindly doctor. After raising the child, the doctor operates on him, replacing his missing parts with mechanical ones. Knowing the child&apos;s destiny, the doctor replaces his missing arms with sword arms, attaches a repeating rifle to one arm, and a cannon to one leg. The game begins with the now-adult Hyakkimaru beginning his quest to reclaim his body parts from the Fiends. Soon joined by the child-thief Dororo, the pair embark on a quest against ancient Japanese demons and the monsters they create.&amp;#xA;Blood Will Tell is an action game where the player controls Hyakkimaru, a man whose body parts were stolen by demons when he was a child. His destiny is to reclaim each of his body parts, which allow him to increase his stats such as HP and power, as well as optional special functions (for example, the eye displays the game in colour, while the vocal chords allow him to speak). Hyakkimaru wields a sword, which can be used to attack enemies - he can also swap for his two smaller swords concealed within his arms. As he uses the swords, they level up and increase in power. Hyakkimaru can also charge up a sword attack, and if released at the correct time, is given the opportunity to enter a series of button presses for combos. If the enemy is killed during this combo, the player can perform a finishing move with the Triangle button which can yield bonus items ranging from health items to swords.&amp;#xA;Hyakkimaru is also outfitted with a repeating rifle and a cannon in his leg. While these are very powerful, they both require their own ammo and cannot be used without it. The gun can be fired rapidly at foes, while the cannon must be charged and aimed for a powerful shot. Both of these weapons have the advantage of being long-range weapons, unlike his swords which must be used at close quarters.&amp;#xA;At a certain point in the game, Hyakkimaru meets the child thief, Dororo. Dororo often assists Hyakkimaru during combat, and can be issued commands, such as &apos;fight&apos;, &apos;evade&apos;, &apos;collect items&apos; or &apos;search&apos;. Sometimes the pair will split up, and Dororo will be playable on his own. These sections are more puzzle-based, with the thief pulling switches to activate puzzles, dodging traps, and stealing items. Dororo can throw rocks from a distance, and later gets smoke bombs which are more incapacitating.</plot>

  <plot>There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.&amp;#xA;Rayne&apos;s primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne&apos;s rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne&apos;s ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.</plot>

Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago.

To set the dice off, you must roll the top face of the die you&apos;re standing on next to the same number of interconnected die with the same face (i.e. connect five 5&apos;s, four 4&apos;s). After a set period of time, the dice will explode, igniting any dice that the explosion touches that either match the number, or are one lower. This game is very fast-paced - you have to keep moving, because if you&apos;re on top of an exploding die, you get knocked out and you lose the game.&amp;#xA;There are several modes of play in Bombastic - Trial Mode, where you try to clear 100 levels; Story Mode, where you progress through stages trying to solve preset puzzles and fight bosses, and Battle Mode, where you fight against four opponents and try to stay alive as long as you can. In addition to the standard Bombastic mode, you can also unlock classic Devil Dice mode, where the dice sink into the ground instead of exploding.</plot>

  <plot>Bomberman Hardball is an action game with four different game modes: Arena, Tennis, Golf and Baseball. The three sports games tend towards the &quot;fun-sport&quot; category (relatively simple controls and physics), but are still grounded in the real rule set: there are no power-ups or special moves. The controls of all three sports follow the genre standards: in Tennis, the player walks towards the ball and hits it, Golf has the standard two-click controls and in Baseball the control switches between pitching (selecting a pitch type and aim) and batting (aiming the hit). All three modes feature either exhibition or tournament play; a few Bomberman characters with different abilities and other playing options, e.g. in Tennis the player can choose between single/double and different courts. Arena has the standard Bomberman gameplay: multiple characters walk around in overhead maps and lay bombs in order to kill the competition. Bombing away destructible blocks may reveal power-ups which have positive (e.g. laying more bombs at once or higher walking speed) or negative (e.g. negating the positive power-ups) effects when picked up. Besides the classic deathmatch, there are also a few other game modes available: star battle (collecting stars), crown battle (the winner needs to find and pick up the crown) and point battle. Each match can also be customized, e.g. handicap, number of power-ups or time limit. The Living Mode allows to create a custom character with unlockable outfits and view AI controlled matches. Except Baseball (restricted to two players), up to four players can participate in matches.</plot>

Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts.&amp;#xA;The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.</plot>

Set in worlds with different themes (ice world, volcanic world, wastelands, forest...), Brave can roam freely, but certain parts are only opened up after solving quests. The boy can jump, duck, climb, and do basic attack moves. While observing, for certain actions, and when using ranged weapons, a first-person view is available as well. During the adventure, Brave acquires new abilities, which allow him to track creatures by smell or their tracks, mimic animals&apos; sounds to lure or distract them, summon creatures, or invoke shaman powers to become an animal (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit and even a skunk). Health is acquired by killing animals or destroying vegetation. Brave can also collect up to five eagle feathers, which allow him to stock up on shaman power that provides superior strength for a short time.&amp;#xA;The exploration gameplay has been mixed with action sequences, where you canoe down river rapids, or ride on a buffalo or an eagle while fighting. There is a strong emphasis on movement and platform-jumping, and there is an adjustable difficulty level, reflected in the amount of hints Grey Bear provides through a &quot;mobile stone&quot;. Next to the abilities, there are different weapons to be found, such as spears, tomahawks and bows. Additionally, Brave can search for secret totems that open up concept art in the menu.</plot>

  <plot>The world is called Deep Earth. The world is a huge underground complex of cities and labyrinths. The world is populated by people who have never seen the sky and the sun in their lives. The world is dark and hostile, and knows no mercy. Technology is well developed in this world, but the society is ruled by a cruel law, dividing all the citizens into classes, depending on the their D-ratio - a form of identifying people and assigning to them a social status at the same time. This is the reality of mankind somewhere in a fantasy universe, where the hero Ryu is thrown into.&amp;#xA;Ryu is a simple guard, a ranger with a low D-ratio - his job is to help to protect the citizens from genics - artificial monsters who have gone wild. During one of such routine patrols, Ryu runs into a mysterious silent girl named Nina, and saves her from a monster. Willing to protect her, Ryu discovers in himself a devastating power. He is now determined to do something for the society of Deep Earth - and perhaps to guide them to the surface of the planet...&amp;#xA;&quot;Dragon Quarter&quot; is a radical departure from the previous titles of the long-running series, and from standard console-style RPGs in general. The game is built as a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is much more strategic than usually: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and to perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items you find in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, your party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles. The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart the game from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience (extra experience you get from battles and from treasure chests, which you can store and then assign to any of the characters). The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising your D-ratio allows you to access new areas every time when you re-play the game.</plot>

The player alternately controls George or Nico. Next to typical adventure gameplay such as exploration, conversations, and searching and combining items, there are also a few action sequences. The characters can duck, sneak, hang from ledges and move crates to reach higher areas.&amp;#xA;The locations visited throughout the game include The Congo, Paris, England, Czech Republic and Egypt.</plot>

  <plot>Brunswick Pro Bowling is a bowling simulation game. In Career mode, after creating an avatar, players compete against the computer to work their way up from amateur to professional. The player character will increase in skill (e.g. strength, accuracy) and earn money while playing. This money can be used to buy clothing or a new bowling ball, which also affects skill. Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a quick round of bowling for one to four players. Making a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it&apos;s also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.</plot>

  <plot>Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while keeping all 4 wheels on the ground.&amp;#xA;Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie&apos;s streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost &quot;burnout&quot; meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!&amp;#xA;Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign. While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints. You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920&apos;s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.&amp;#xA;Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact packages new modes of play. Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race. Or you can reverse that with a friend. You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you. Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible. The bigger the crash, the better. Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.&amp;#xA;Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.</plot>

Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score).&amp;#xA;However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn&apos;t feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer.

  <plot>The fourth Burnout racing game puts you once again in the eye of traffic storms, where you do not only rush to be the fastest, but brutally, yet stylishly, take down your opponents. This is emphasized by impact time, which shows crashes in all their slowed-down glory, and the boost you receive after a successful wrecking. Reckless driving bumps your Revenge rank, unlocking new events. This can also be achieved by medal placings that grant new vehicles.&amp;#xA;Collectible signature takedowns, crashbreakers (detonate your vehicle, now also in some regular races) and aftertouch for precise havoc remain, but one of the major changes is the ability to check traffic. Non-racing vehicles are no longer a nuisance with the sole purpose of slowing you down. They can now be actively used to obstruct traffic or send them into your foes. The Road Rage mode (take down a set number of rivals within a time limit) and Crash mode make a return, but Traffic Attack is new - race against the clock and level the traffic at the same time. Other modes include regular races, grand prix races, Burning Lap (high-speed time attack), Eliminator (last one after each round is out) and a normal time attack mode.&amp;#xA;In the Crash mode, the multipliers and bonuses have been removed, and you cannot drive at full speed towards a crossroads. You have to time your start to receive a proper boost and then it is only about steering, crashbreakers and aftertouch. There are many new tracks and cars, a soundtrack with lots of famous artists, and a new world tour in different countries.&amp;#xA;Online multiplayer is available for up to six players. New off-line additions are the split-screen Traffic Attack and a hot-seat Crash Tour for up to six players, next to the familiar Road Rage, Crash Party and Crash Battle modes.</plot>

  <plot>Buzz!: Brain of the UK is a general knowledge quiz game about the United Kingdom in the long-running Buzz series. Instead of just translating the same questions for each country that is a part of the UK, each country&apos;s version has lots of nationally specific questions. For instance, in the British version there are questions on Eastenders or Corrie. It is part of the global Buzz!: Brain of the World brand with 21 different versions for specific countries, such as Buzz!: Brain of Oz for Australia.&amp;#xA;In addition to that localized content, Brain of the UK also retains the MyBuzz feature which enables users to create custom quizzes. All quiz packs bought on previous Buzz games are also playable in this version.&amp;#xA;The PlayStation 3 version features online play and allows users access to user created questions on the My Buzz! site as well as leaderboards that rank online play.&amp;#xA;The PSP version contains a single player game and includes the &quot;pass-around&quot; mode from the previous PSP titles in the series to enable up to 6 players to take part in the same quiz.</plot>

  <plot>As part of the PlayStation 2&apos;s holy trinity of casual gamer friendly franchises, which also includes EyeToy and SingStar, Buzz! is one of those rare cases where being a one trick pony is exactly what makes it so appealing. The initial games were simple interactive quiz games, whose big gimmick was that they came with a set of special game show buzzer controllers instead of relying on the traditional DualShock controller. The Buzz! Junior games though are a slightly different affair - you still use the simple five button buzzers, but to play mini-games not answer questions. As a sequel to Jungle Party this actually does pretty well, with a much more consistent range of mini-games than the original. There&apos;s no separate single player mode any more though, with computer controlled opponents simply filling in the gaps. There&apos;s also not much of a plot either, as you simply compete with other primary coloured robots at the Robot Academy. Thankfully this doesn&apos;t involve a two hour maths exam, but instead mini-games like rhythm action variant Octo Beat, hammer throwing (but with robots), Whack-A-Mole with aliens, and cybernetic basketball. Few of the mini-games are genuinely original, and there are only twenty-five, but they are at least all entertaining. The only caveat to all this is that, unlike things like Mario Party, this is strictly for very young children. No one with an age in double digits is going to tolerate it for very long - but then that&apos;s largely the point, since so few games are aimed at very young kids nowadays. Particularly if you&apos;ve already got the buzzer controllers from a previous game (or aim to use them again) this is actually quite an effective form of interactive child quietener.

Another option is the Adrenaline mode where time comes almost completely to a stop, making it easier to line up the shots and get a lot of kills.&amp;#xA;Different types of equipment become available to assist in the hunt, and in certain missions it is not required to kill animals - tranquillizing them is sufficient.</plot>

  <plot>This version of Call of Duty: World at War is very different from its counterparts. Aside from the graphics engine, the violence is toned down, resembling its predecessor and it features different storylines, locations and missions from the other versions.&amp;#xA;The story is divided into four campaigns. The first takes place at the beginning of the war in the South Pacific as the player takes control of Pvt. Joe Miller serving with the American 2nd Marine Division as they start out in basic training in North Carolina. This level lets the player learn the controls of the game and then fastforwards to the Guadalcanal (as though the training mission was a flashback) where the player must survive with his company. There are four more missions, two on the island of Betio and two on the island of Saipan.&amp;#xA;The second part takes place in Europe after D-Day with four missions divided by two different experiences. The first two has the player take command of Pvt. Lucas Gibson of the American 80th Infantry Division as he and his squad make their way through Luxembourg and finally through Bastone mounted on a Sherman tank, trying to break through Nazi lines. The last two missions let the player take control of Pvt. Tom Sharpe of the British 6th Airbone Division, battling through the ruins of Bastone and the town of Bure.&amp;#xA;The third part only consists of two missions that are divided between Pvt. Sharpe and Pvt. Gibson and is set in the closing days of the war in Europe. The first mission takes place in Wesel where Pvt. Sharpe and his division must find a way across the Rhine. The second has Pvt. Gibson and his division battle through the town of Braunau am Inn, the birthplace of Adolph Hitler, as they need to stop a V2 rocket from being launched.&amp;#xA;The last campaign reverts back to Pvt. Joe Miller at the end of the Pacific Theatre, this time with two missions on the island of Okinawa, with the last mission having the player take Castle Shuri in an attempt to capture Okinawa and open the gate to the Japanese mainland.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is of the first-person shooter kind and is told through in game cutscenes as well as stock footage of World War II, both black &amp; white and color. The controls are basic, with a main weapon and secondary along with two grenades (smoke and frag). Movement is done through the left analog stick with aiming through the right one. Players can fire their weapon using the &quot;R1&quot; button and switch between using &quot;Triangle&quot;, manually reloading them using the &quot;Square&quot; button and aim down the sight using the &quot;L1&quot; button. Jumping and hurling obstacles (when prompted) is done through the &quot;X&quot; button, a melee attack can be obtained through the &quot;R3&quot; button and sprinting through the &quot;L3&quot; button. The &quot;O&quot; button is used for crouching while holding the button down will let the player&apos;s character prone.&amp;#xA;Players can obtain ammo through fallen comrades and new weapons by standing over top of the weapon and holding the &quot;Square&quot; button. Likewise, fallen enemy weapons can be obtained this way. There is no number of preset lives and once a player is killed he can restart from a previous checkpoint. There is no health bar system, instead it resembles Medal of Honor: Vanguard where once the player starts to sustain an considerable amount of damage, the view will start to become red. This can be stopped by taking cover away from enemy fire which will allow the players health to replenish.</plot>

As with other Call of Duty games, focus is on the characters and their drama amidst the furious, heavily scripted, first-person action. As a private new to war in America&apos;s most legendary infantry division, nicknamed the Big Red One for the distinctive patch they wore, players will fight through the game as a team in the Fighting First, and will be affected by the loss of friends on the battlefield.&amp;#xA;Players will have to re-enact the successes of World War II through a wide variety of land, sea and air missions in Africa, Sicily and Normandy, by using vehicles including tanks, jeeps, armored cars and half-tracks. Success will depend on how well players can move, shoot and complete the objectives that a commanding officer provides before each mission.&amp;#xA;The Xbox and PS2 versions offer multiplayer games with up to 16 players.</plot>

  <plot>The third main Call of Duty game centers around Operation Cobra in Normandy, France, the World War II operation planned by United States Army General Omar Bradley to break out from the Normandy area after the previous month&apos;s D-Day landings. You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris.&amp;#xA;The battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers&apos; hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.&amp;#xA;The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.&amp;#xA;There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.</plot>

  <plot>A beat&apos;em&apos;up with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around &quot;grooves&quot; which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character&apos;s abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove.&amp;#xA;The &quot;EO&quot; of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character&apos;s moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases.&amp;#xA;Playable characters come from the following games:&amp;#xA;1. Street Fighter (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat)&amp;#xA;2. Final Fight (Rolento)&amp;#xA;Street Fighter II (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangeif, M. Bison, Balrog, Vega)&amp;#xA;3.

The GPS coordinates involve a case dealing with the infamous thief Carmen Sandiego, who Cole wants to capture despite being still just in training. It seems Carmen wants to put back together a set of stolen tribal drums that will unleash an unspeakable power. There are two other ACME operatives, Jules and Shadow, who are working on the case in Siberia at the moment so they can only help Cole with advice through email messages. The game consists of exploring nine different locales all over the world from New York to Thailand. Each locale is broken down into several areas. Each area has different items to collect. The main items to collect are compasses. These will help in locating Carmen Sandiego&apos;s whereabouts. Another item Cole can collect are puzzle pieces. Collecting these will unlock a jigsaw puzzle for Cole to solve. Also for Cole to make his way through areas, he has to defeat some enemy combatants who possess key codes. A few key codes are needed to unlock forcefields, which block the pathways to get further into the area. To defeat enemies, Cole is equipped with a staff he can use to whack enemies with. He also comes equipped with a dart gun, which he can use to hit switches he can&apos;t reach otherwise. Cole must also move stealthily through each area to avoid security measures and to get a drop on unsuspecting enemy units. Cole has other moves he can perform such as pole vaulting with his staff, rolling from a crouch position, pressing his body close to a wall, double jumping, tightrope walking, and hanging from ledges, pipes, and even ziplines. During the game, players can access a menu with various tabs. The atlas tab gives educational factoids about the area Cole is in. The map tab gives detailed information about the area that Cole is currently exploring. The GPS tab gives information about where Carmen Sandiego will be heading next. The transport tab let&apos;s the player go back to the areas they previously explored in their current location. The communication tab lets the player receive messages from Jules and Shadow. .</plot>

You can also craft your own weapons either by using an existing weapon as a base, and having some additional material such as bronze, steel and aluminium or having an extra amount of materials.&amp;#xA;The battle system allows you to lock on to an enemy and hit them with multiple combos. You have some control on your Innocent Devil, and can command it to use certain skills, guard you and join the fight.</plot>

  <plot>Castlevania: Lament of Innocence is the prequel to all Castlevania games previously released, explaining the connection and never-ending war between the Belmont family and Dracula. It is one of the first 3-D Castlevania games (the others being on the N64). The team who created the PS1 Castlevania: Symphony of the Night completely remake the formula.&amp;#xA;You play Leon Belmont, who was once a Baron for the King. After his betrothed, Sara, was kidnapped and taken to a large castle, Leon asked the Church for permission to command his underlings to attack the castle. Because of the Crusades going on in the East, he is denied such. But because of his love for Sara, he denounces his title and leaves, going with no weapon or clue to the castle. He is stopped by an alchemist named Rinaldo, who was once a vampire-hunter himself. He gives Leon the Whip of Alchemy, offers to help him further in his quest, and sends him on his way.&amp;#xA;The gameplay mixes a style of hack-and-slash with a sense of strategy. In order to gain new abilities, you must first master the previous ones. This also includes relics and orbs, which will greatly help you in your quest to rescue Sara. Relics allow you to do special abilities necessary to solving certain puzzles, while orbs combine with power-ups you pick up and can create massive offensive or defensive power. This makes the game incredibly addictive. You&apos;ll be trying to find every Relic and Orb and unlock every Skill.&amp;#xA;The game has many hidden secrets - In fact, most gamers will only find about two Relics through the entire game. There are also five hidden bosses, each giving you something very good. A few will give you whip power-ups, while others will give you orbs and relics. Getting the game&apos;s discovery rating to 100% is quite a task, but well worth it in the end.</plot>

  <plot>In &quot;Cold Winter&quot;, you play the role of Andrew Sterling, a former member of MI6, the British secret intelligence service. Andrew is caught preparing to assassinate someone in China, and is thrown into prison. There he faces torture and imminent execution. But a former friend from his MI6 days arranges to rescue him and offers him a job, having planned in advance to manipulate him so that he is unable to refuse. The first task seems fairly ordinary: to track down a weapons dealer who has been supplying terrorists.&amp;#xA;But soon Andrew&apos;s mission becomes more important, because he must deal with a sinister conspiracy that embraces the whole world. In the story, there is a secret society called the Greywings, which slowly began to form form after World War I. The organization dedicated itself to stopping nuclear weapons proliferation by any means. Their obsessive leader, John Grey, finally decided that this effort is hopeless. He set in motion a plan calculated to cause the nuclear war he had been trying to prevent for his whole life, reasoning that it is better to have the war under controlled conditions, because it would have happened sooner or later.&amp;#xA;He set the plan in motion by developing an information warfare program called Octopus, He sold Octopus widely on the black market, so that it would proliferate rapidly and many groups would fight to control it. Octopus is designed to fool its buyers, so each will believe the program lets them take over a wide variety of nuclear weapons control networks in various countries. But this is not so. For on the prearranged &quot;test&quot; date, Octopus will give remote control of several nuclear arsenals to the remaining members of the Greywings secret society -- not to the program&apos;s buyers, who will receive all the blame. It is Andrew Stirling who must stop the plan from working. He must track them down and follow them to &apos;Winterlong,&apos; a hidden bunker in the Arctic, where they have taken shelter.&amp;#xA;In this first-person shooter, you can collect over 20 weapons to kill your enemies. You can only carry two of them simultaneously, although it is also possible to use grenades. You can make weapons by combining items you find. For example, a fuel can, a bottle, and cloth combine to make a Molotov cocktail. A business card and some poison make a business card that is poisoned. You shouldn&apos;t worry about finding healing items, though, because you carry along an unlimited health pack. You need to remember to use this at the proper time, though, or of course you will still be killed. In combat, you can use various objects to help you. For example, you can throw pots at your enemies Large objects such as chairs, desks, and even wheeled carts can be pushed to block the enemy&apos;s path or to provide limited cover for yourself.&amp;#xA;The game has replay value, because to some extent, it is possible to take the roles of two other primary characters in the story. Replay value also comes from the fact that enemies react in unscripted, sensible ways. They move cleverly, respond to alarms, change posture, take cover, divide themselves, and work in groups. Depending on how quickly you are able to react, they are likely to send someone to get reinforcements, and they yell for help. Finally, there is a sense of realism. Perceptions become confused when the character is under stress. Graphical quality is good. Also, Cold Winter uses flashbacks to explain what has already happened, so there is a sense of knowing how the characters have reached their current places in the story.</plot>

Group B features cars from the &apos;80s that were banned in 1986, as they were unrestricted and capable of extreme acceleration. And finally, Expert is for those that finish 4WD in advanced mode, upon which they are presented with Expert mode where one drives with cockpit view only, and with the highest damage setting.&amp;#xA;There are 8 national rallies in which to race, including USA, Australia, UK, Finland, Japan and Greece.

  <plot>In Conflict Desert Storm, you control a squad of four soldiers from either the British S.A.S or American Delta Force. The game is set during the first gulf war back in the early 1990s and has ideas borrowed from the book Bravo Two Zero and other real missions from the war.&amp;#xA;You are sent behind enemy lines to command a squad of elite commandos, set to destroy key strategic sites in Iraq. On your team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper. Each soldier has different skills which can be built up by killing enemies. As your troops gain more experience, they will gain ranks and upgrade their skills. As their skills get better, the more effective they become at doing their job. For example, Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase.&amp;#xA;Conflict: Desert Storm is a first person/third person shooter, and each mode can be switched by the press of a button. You and your team are sent on missions with specific objectives, whether it be to infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, or assassinate an opposing general. You can both control your men individually and send them orders. Your men can be ordered to attack, retreat, follow, stay, and do many more things. If the mission requires it, you must drive tanks and jeeps around while your squad mans the guns on the vehicle. There is also the ability to play up to four player co-op with friends, with each person controlling a soldier in your squad.&amp;#xA;At the end of each mission, if you performed well, your men are awarded medals for their bravery. If you work hard enough, you may even be able to earn the Medal of Honor.</plot>

  <plot>This installment of the Conflict series occurs in many diverse regions of the World: in Conflict: Global Terror, Red Team spends the game fighting international terrorism.&amp;#xA;Rather than gung-ho desert tank warfare, or tense jungle ambush fighting, the game explores many non-army locations such as gas factories, cocaine production facilities and hotels.&amp;#xA;The combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels seem to mix up the killzone areas giving a wide variety that support combat over many varying ranges. The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic - fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out.&amp;#xA;The gadgets are useful and are frequently found to be helpful: thermal goggles let the player see through smoke, and Bradley&apos;s laser designator can mark key targets for gunship air strike. Claymore mines allow the team to protect their rear or even set up ambushes.&amp;#xA;The game is very flexible - adopting all playing styles. Players are free to run and gun, or play as a super-stealthy special forces team. Players can play as one character leading the team, or switch around between characters as they see fit. Ordering the team about and switching characters is quick and simple. It is even possible to give each member advanced orders - &quot;On my signal, Connors runs to the window, Bradley opens the door and Jones throws a grenade through the window &quot;. Ready... GO!!! Conflict: Global Terror allows this kind of planning if the player wants to play that way. The co-op allows multiple players to take control of Red Team.&amp;#xA;There are 4 difficulty modes and a skill learning curve for beginners an veterans alike. There are over 30 weapons with individual stats and behaviours. Each has their own distinct advantages and disadvantages - pistols are sometimes a better choice than a light machine gun for example, so the game aims to be more flexible to different playing styles.&amp;#xA;The story unfolds throughout the missions and also in the cutscenes in between missions. The team really is made up of 4 distinct characters, with their own personal histories, lives and personalities.</plot>

To defuse one of the numerous booby traps it is necessary to have skills in that ability.&amp;#xA;The levels are set around the jungle and include underground Vietcong complexes or temples. You don&apos;t only meet enemies but also friendly persons like own soldiers or citizens with which you can talk and which sometimes give you bonus objectives. Furthermore, in some missions you can use stationary weapons like machine guns and drive jeeps or tanks.&amp;#xA;The console versions of Conflict: Vietnam feature a split-screen multiplayer co-op mode with up to four players (Xbox) resp. two players (PS2).

  <plot>John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC. This game is based on the movie Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves. The player assumes the role of Constantine, a mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face of Good. He also smokes a lot.&amp;#xA;The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine&apos;s goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch&apos;s Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film.</plot>

  <plot>Counter Terrorist Special Force is an action game in which you are a part of an anti-terrorist force whose sole purpose is to strike where striking is needed and put end to evil plans to destroy/take over the world. The player controls two different heroes. Night Owl is an infiltrations expert, and very good at accurate shooting and jumping from planes, which some of the missions require him to do. Raptor on the other hand, is a weapons expert. He is also more than adequate in hand-to-hand combat. These two take turns in their own levels on their way to destroy the evil NEMESIS group and retrieve the stolen scientific plans. Levels are always very action-oriented even when playing as Night Owl and there are very little sneaking to do, as the main focus is on action. The levels range from your basic submarine factories to hidden missile silos and so on, with a few outdoor levels here and there, in which one usually can drive one of the vehicles (jeeps, hovercrafts, boats, etc). There are multiple weapons to choose from. From knives to huge rocket launchers and solid turrets. The physics system is also implemented in the game and most of the time there is a nice amount of stuff and dudes flying around as you make havoc with havok.</plot>

  <plot>Moorhuhn returns with a complete redesign in 3D in this sequel to previous titles of the Moorhuhn shooter series. Instead of simply flying and running around, the chickens feature a lot of animated motion sequences that make them seem almost alive. The surroundings are completely generated in 3D and feature a lot of crazy objects and scenes such as two hedgehogs playing cards (one is actually wearing dark sunglasses!). The chickens try to hide in every conceivable place on screen, be it an old oven or in an outdoor toilet. They hide in wheat fields and even dress up as a sunflower in order to escape the player&apos;s dreadful gun. All these features make it more difficult for the player to get all the chickens. The actual shooting controls remain the same as in previous Moorhuhn games: the player aims with the mouse, shoots by clicking the left mouse button and reloads by clicking the right mouse button.</plot>

  <plot>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can&apos;t be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.&amp;#xA;In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.&amp;#xA;Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</plot>

For many, the creation of the Virtuaroids (VR) began a new age as the 49-foot mechanical giants gained the attention of everyone and anyone nearby. Noticing this, business makers used the opportunity to create a new form of entertainment upon the surface of Mars. Known as Limited War, the performances drew crowds the universe over. It wasn&apos;t until corporate greed appeared once more that things began to fall out of control. Those in power began to fight each other for a stake in the new events, leading to internal fighting and crime. A special investigations unit was formed, in hopes it would eliminate such crime and bring order back. They are known as &apos;MARZ&apos;, and as a member of that team you must use your new found position to your advantage. In each mission, you will control your own VR and must defend or attack a number of key locations and other VR units. Over time you will gain new additions to the machines armour and weapons which will aid you in later missions. You&apos;ll also unlock bigger and more powerful VR&apos;s as well.</plot>

  <plot>By 2078, earth&apos;s natural resources have been depleted. Massive CO2 emissions have occurred and there are no longer fossil fuel reserves. Because of global warming, the rise of the ocean level has made many countries disappear. Fortunately, extreme weather patterns have emerged and wind has become an endless resource with enormous speeds. Mankind has adapted and now uses the powerful wind as a source for transportation, constructing vehicles to make use of it. Additionally, The International Racing League is organized, a racing event where speed is determined by the control of wind. This is where you come in.&amp;#xA;Cyclone Circus is a racer where you can compete against 9 computer players or against another player in dual screen mode. The cars sport an exotic and futuristic design, and each car has a plasma sail that you have to use as good as you can. Turning the wind to your advantage, you can pick up numerous bonuses and even power-ups that will catapult you ahead of your opponents. Each level has a very specific setting and atmosphere, and contains a number of special jump sites and bonus areas where you can do special tricks to score more points.&amp;#xA;There are ten characters, nine courses with shortcuts, and eight trick levels based on ramps and fly routes.</plot>

Head to head requires two controllers while the other two require just the one. In all modes the player can either select the track they wish to dance to or let the game select a random track, jukebox mode also has a dance recorder function, which does not have to be unlocked as it did in Dance:UK, but when the player dances to the playback the score is not recorded in the high score table. Though the game is intended to be used with a dance mat it can be played using a standard controller.

  <plot>Slightly varied in technology and musical content from the Japanese arcade game and home port of the same name as well as the parallel European release Dancing Stage SuperNova 2, this game delivers rhythmic play that has become well-established over the course of the series&apos; dynasty -- to gloss generally, players are rated on how effectively they deliver input in response to a continuously-scrolling list of controller direction instructions. When the screen tells players that they&apos;re about to be called upon to hit the &quot;left&quot; button as its corresponding glyph ascends up the screen, they must try to match it precisely at the moment of the glyph&apos;s overlap with a target area at the top of the screen. DDR games being what they are, this is all synchronized to player-selected electro-pop music with music video or animated dancing avatar sideshows, and of course is intended for play with the series&apos; trademark control device, a giant four-way directional pad laid on the floor to be rhythmically walked upon. (Two can be used simultaneously for two players or one who boasts some simply spectacular dance moves.)&amp;#xA;After the attainment of various in-game achievements have granted the players sufficient points to &quot;buy&quot; an initially-locked handful in the in-game &quot;store&quot;, this game offers up 72 different songs (some in a fragmentary form) in a variety of styles from Konami&apos;s J-pop stable as well as regionalised tunes from recognized Western artists.&amp;#xA;In addition to the standard &quot;pick three songs and see how high a cumulative score you can rack up, supposing you don&apos;t get prematurely booted due to low performance&quot; game mode, the game offers variant play types: &quot;hyper master&quot; mode (taking on extra tasks in order to earn achievements such as Supportive Modules to make things easier and Challenge Modules to make them tougher), workout mode (to help calculate calories burned and long-term exercise routines), advanced modes (initial options include battle -- competitive vs. the computer or a human player -- or course, running through a selected playlist... and eventually unlocking survival mode, endless mode, and the combo challenge mode), training mode (to help learn the steps to a particular song), and edit mode (for custom programming of your own choreographed dance steps!)&quot;</plot>

The object of the game is to get as many arrows in the right order and at the right time to get a high score.

Along with the basic game mode, there is an endurance mode which plays through an entire CDs worth of songs, a fitness mode which counts calories and a record mode that lets you create your own dance. There is also a &apos;creature&apos; mode that makes a computer animated character dance along with the music on screen and an EyeToy mode that adds hand icons to the dance patterns that the player&apos;s onscreen camera image must hit in time to the music.&amp;#xA;Dance Factory also includes a multiplayer mode that allows two players to dance simultaneously in a head to head battle or cooperatively to compete for higher scores. Multiplayer also features a tournament mode where up to 16 players can compete in a series of head to head battles to pick an eventual winner.</plot>

Points are awarded for accuracy with bonus multipliers awarded for making certain &apos;combos&apos; (mini-routines within a song which are deemed especially difficult or long).

The player selects their difficulty level and their track and then attempts to score points by hitting the correct buttons in sequence. During the song the player is treated to an distant view of an animated disco dancer on a stage and illuminated with coloured lights. Once the track is over the player can enter their name, assuming they have achieved a high score. The game holds eight scores for each of the three difficulty levels but no scores are recorded for Workout and Recorder modes. The game has a workout mode in which the player first enters their weight, in kilograms, and then selects a track. Gameplay here is basically the same as the main game but instead of points the game calculates the number of calories burned. There is no difficulty setting for this game mode and the arrows come thick and fast. The Recorder option allows the player to create and save their own dance, there is no high score for this and while the dance moves are preserved from one game to the next only one routine can be saved.

  <plot>Dancing Stage Max ,is meant to be played on a dance mat or platform controller. As the song plays, arrows scroll up the screen in time with the music and you score points by stepping on the corresponding arrow on the mat as they reach the top. &quot;Freeze arrows&quot; have long trails; on these you must step and hold your foot down for the duration of the arrow, using your other foot to make other steps in the meantime. Your score depends on your timing. When you step with good timing, your dance meter rises; when you miss, it falls. If your dance meter drops to empty, you fail. Dance Master mode presents you with a series of challenges to earn points to unlock songs, courses (where you play a sequence of songs nonstop), special modes, and optional graphic textures. You can use an EyeToy USB camera to display the player(s) dancing on the screen instead of the normal backgrounds. Hands and Feet mode uses the camera to add hand waving to the gameplay. Workout mode that tracks your calories burned for players who use DDR in their exercise regimen. You can play with one or two players, or with other players in online play. A demo of Karaoke Revolution is included.</plot>

  <plot>Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse is a 3D action-role-playing game set in the seventeenth century, where you play as Anna, a mysterious woman who must protect a village against the armies of the Shadow Lord, which are made up of vampires and other assorted creatures.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is much like the Diablo series where you are assigned a quest in one of three villages, then accomplish it in one of three dungeons or one of three battlefields battling randomly-generated groups of monsters that drop random equipment based on a drop-rate formula. You improve your character through a slow progression of leveling up from experience points and finding better equipment or purchasing it from villagers. Each mission you accomplish improves the economy, research or military stats of the village you are doing it for, which is what determines which items they have available for purchase.&amp;#xA;There are three basic monster-types: Undead, Forgotten and Mutants. There are seven basic types of melee weapons. Two each do extra damage to each type of monster and the final does extra damage to groups. There are also four kinds of guns and a variety of bombs.&amp;#xA;The object of the game is make Anna into an all-powerful warrior through battling and questing before a year is up and the Shadow Lord attacks. This takes upward of 100 hours of game time. At this point, she must defeat the Shadow Lord for good.</plot>

  <plot>400 Years ago, a war between the Eastern Continent and the Western Wizard Army destroyed the world as a great power was unleashed. Time has passed and in present day, the power-hungry General Flag has organized a ritual to awaken this power once more: the Dark Genie. Barely controlled by a spell, the Dark Genie once again breaks the world, beginning with the village of Norune. The only survivor of Norune is a boy named Toan, son of the great hero Ada. As Toan surveys the destruction, the Spirit King appears and tells him that all is not lost; pieces of the world, including buildings and people, have been sealed away in protective Atla spheres. Using a magic glove called the Atlamillia, Toan must resurrect the world and find the powers necessary to defeat the Dark Genie.&amp;#xA;Dark Cloud is an action-RPG title, often compared to Soul Blazer, played from the 3rd person perspective. Toan must enter randomly generated dungeons where he will battle monsters and recover Atla spheres. Toan battles with a sword, which can be slashed directly in front of him or powered up for a stronger blow. During his travels, Toan encounters other characters who will offer to aid him and can be switched to during dungeons, with individual statistics and weapons. Items are also found and shared among the party, including restorative items, attack items and general power-ups. Each character has a thirst meter, which much be replenished or health will start to drain. Should a character lose all their health, they will fall in battle and be returned to town unless Stand-In powder is used, in which case that character is unavailable and control passes to another.&amp;#xA;Toan is the only character able to collect Atla spheres which contain different items needed to restore the villages destroyed by the Dark Genie. Rebuilding is done outside the dungeon in a designated village area. Buildings can be placed down, rotated and moved as need be. They can also be upgraded with additional furniture and people (usually the owners of the building). As the dungeons are conquered and the area becomes more lifelike, treasure chests start appearing around the town and villagers often become friendlier. Some villagers have additional requests, such as being placed facing the east, for the placement of their homes.&amp;#xA;Each character in Toan&apos;s party uses a unique weapon, but several different types of weapon under each category can be collected. As weapons are used, they gain Absorption (Abs). These Abs points are used as &amp;quot;experience&amp;quot; for the weapon and can upgrade the weapon&apos;s abilities. Each weapon features a number of &amp;quot;slots&amp;quot; to which power-up items can be attached, any items attached to slots will be absorbed when the weapon is upgraded. Each weapon has certain attributes which must be improved in order to &amp;quot;build up&amp;quot; to a different type of weapon. Additionally, any weapon reaching level 5 can be broken into a Synthsphere, an item containing 60% of its abilities, which can then be attached to slots on different weapons. In this manner, weapons can always be upgraded or used in the improvement of another weapon throughout the game. The game also features certain sequences where buttons must be pressed in the correct order and correct timing in order to progress.</plot>

  <plot>The Darkwatch is an ancient organization hell-bent on destroying evil in the world. They have just captured the vampire lord Lazarus and are transporting him back to headquarters for questioning, when an outlaw tries to rob the train and instead of finding riches releases Lazarus from his hold, but not before the outlaw is bitten by the vampire lord. As Jericho Cross, the former outlaw and now the newest member of the Darkwatch, you must find and kill Lazarus, lest you turn into a full-blown vampire yourself.&amp;#xA;Darkwatch is a first-person shooter set in the Wild West with supernatural beings. Fight your way through reapers, undead riflemen, banshees and other creatures using Darkwatch weaponry that doubles as melee weapons, such as a revolver, two-fisted pistols, a crossbow (with dynamite attached to the bolts) and a Rail Rocket. You will also find dynamite along the way to throw at the enemy and to destroy barricades. Along with conventional weapons, Cross will acquire vampire powers of good or evil nature that you must choose in the story. If you decide to be good, then you receive powers such as Silver Bullet that increases your shots with holy fire or Vindicator that calls down chain lightning on your enemies. If you choose to be evil, you will receive Blood Frenzy that makes melee attacks supernaturally powerful and Soul Stealer, which sucks the very souls from distant enemies. Regardless of good or evil, you will always have Blood Shield (protection from losing health), Vampire Jump (for those hard to reach areas) and Blood Vision (causes enemies, weapons and other important objects to glow). With every creature killed, there will be at least one Blood Cloud and sometimes more to replenish your health and restore your Vampire Powers.&amp;#xA;In single player you can choose from story mode (follow the story of Jericho Cross one chapter at a time) or Gunslinger mode (replay any level unlocked in story mode as either evil or good). At the end of the level, you see your number of kills and accuracy percentage, which, if it is good enough, will unlock some movies and concept art.&amp;#xA;Play on-line over Xbox Live with up to 16 players or up to 4 people in split-screen mode. Multiplayer matches include Death Match, Team Death Match, Capture the Flag, Soul Hunter (fight to collect Blood Clouds and be the first to fill your Blood Bar) and Team Soul Hunter. You can adjust the settings for each match regarding the game type, map in which you wish to play, total time play, score limit and kill limit.&amp;#xA;In the main menu, you can choose Extras to view concept art unlocked from playing Gunslinger Mode, movies from Story Mode and your statistics from Story Mode and Gunslinger Mode.</plot>

  <plot>Dawn of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 4) is a game in the World of Mana / Seiken Densetsu series by Square Enix. The story takes place shortly before Sword of Mana and as an action game with exploration elements the gameplay involves traversing levels full of challenges including feats of dexterity, solving puzzles, and defeating monsters in various ways. Unlike the other games in the series, it cannot be considered an RPG.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is separated by cut-scenes that depict the plot and story using the characters and environments, voice-overs, narration, and pictures. The player controls the main character, Keldy, who wields a sword for attacking, a whip for grabbing and throwing, and pellets for ranged attacks. Unlike the other Mana games there are no shops where equipment or new items can be bought - there are only music tracks and movie clips. Keldy can only enhance his combat performance with certain ribbons and special arrows. Enhancements come through emblems, by meeting certain requirements, left behind by enemies or bought at the Challenge Arena shop. They usually boost the character&apos;s basic abilities. Magic is also available through seven different spells.&amp;#xA;The story is divided into eight chapters and the game also sports a Challenge Arena mode where players need to complete 32 separate challenges, optionally with the help of a pet, bought in shops or obtained through eggs discovered in the game. The game uses the Havok physics system, allowing Keldy to use his whip on almost any part of the environment. This is further encouraged through the game&apos;s Mono system, where objects hit in the surroundings of enemies induces panic, also making available boost medals.</plot>

When fighting, you have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. When against an enemy and you have no gun drawn, you can perform &amp;quot;disarm&amp;quot; moves, which causes your character to steal the enemy&apos;s gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as your progress.&amp;#xA;A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack&apos;s best friend, and partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog. Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away, and retrieve their gun in Shadow&apos;s jaws.&amp;#xA;Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of &amp;quot;Bullet-Time&amp;quot; from Max Payne.

  <plot>In this Tekken spin-off, you control assassin Nina Williams as she fights to take down terrorist organization/evil corporation Kometa. She infiltrated a luxury cruise ship, Amphitrite, as a fighter in an illegal fighting tournament. The mission was to find out more about this organization, and two other CIA operatives were sent onboard the cruiser. Nina was but a support member of the team, not to take anything in her own hands unless her colleagues fail. Yet, when she is taken captive, and receives the news of mission failed, she&apos;s about to take matters into her own hands, and do what she&apos;s trained to do... sweep off the decks.&amp;#xA;Nina must make her way through a large cruise ship, finding keys and scanning prints to gain access to more areas while using stealth to avoid the guards. When stealth fails, the game&apos;s more unique aspects come into play. Although game uses 3rd-person perspective, on certain occasions it switches to 1st-person view such as when using a sniper rifle, swimming underwater, or crawling the ducts.&amp;#xA;Death by Degrees uses analog sticks to perform the attacks. The left stick moves Nina, and make her dodge when tapped instead of moved gradually, while the right stick makes her attack in whatever direction it is tapped, so attacks can be executed in any direction. Blocks are executed by holding the right stick toward the enemy at the precise moment of attack. In fights, you can disable enemies quickly with precisely-aimed bone-breaking maneuvers. When executed correctly, the game switches to an x-ray views to bone crushing a bit more enhanced then it was done in Rogue Ops. You can lock camera over your shoulder in most of the areas, which then allows you to freely rotate the camera while Nina is constantly in her running mode. Beside martial arts, she can use variety of melee weapons like knives, batons, swords, and such, as well as pistols, machine guns, and other firearms. As you defeat opponents, you gain points which serves you to upgrade already rich plethora of moves and attacks.</plot>

A deadly virus dubbed &quot;gray death&quot; is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as &quot;Ambrosia&quot; manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization &quot;Silhouette&quot; bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, it&apos;s mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service.

But on his way from the airport to the city, a terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the city.&amp;#xA;But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the earth can start trembling...&amp;#xA;This game, also known as &quot;Zettai Zetsumei Toshi&quot; (Japanese original title), or &quot;SOS - Final Escape&quot; (European title), is a combination of pure adventure and survival/horror genres. The controls, the inventory management, the camera, that changes angles automatically depending on your location, but mostly the necessity to survive can be linked to Alone in the Dark and its countless clones, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his thirst, so you&apos;ll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game serve also as save points.</plot>

Characters can also &quot;gang up&quot; on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character.

  <plot>When intercepting Drakken and Shego&apos;s latest plan to swipe a mystical monkey idol from a spooky mansion, Dr. Drakken and Ron Stoppable get their minds switched! The idol is quickly lost, and Kim Possible and her arch-rival Shego reluctantly team up to get it back and set things back to normal.&amp;#xA;Kim Possible: What&apos;s the Switch? is a side-scrolling 2D platformer with visual similarities to Klonoa 2, excluding the ability to change the paths you take. The camera follows Kim (or Shego) as you progress through various levels - while it plays like a 2D platformer, it gives the illusion of 3D. The main goal of each level is to get to the end of the level; however, there are also sub-goals of collecting all the Kimmunicator tokens within a level (which unlock concept art amongst other things), and collecting the Club Banana tokens hidden in secret spots (which unlock new outfits to wear).&amp;#xA;Shego and Kim control quite similarly, in that they can both perform kung-fu attacks, backflips and double jumps. Later on, they both gain the ability to use a grapple and EMP bomb to disable special enemies. In addition to this, Kim has super sticky gum which can be used to snag enemies and control switches remotely, while Shego gains a magnetic power to move metal objects from far away.</plot>

One year after &quot;The Twilight Incident&quot;, a huge fire started in CC Corp destroying most of the original &quot;The World&quot; servers and forcing them to shut the game down soon after. A new version of the &quot;The World&quot; was created one year after the fire called &quot;The World R:2&quot;. You play as Haseo, a PKK (Player Killer Killer) searching for the player killer who Data Drained his friend into a coma, Tri-Edge.&amp;#xA;The player meets reliable friends in Gaspard, Silabus, Atoli, Kuhn and many others later in game. The battle system is still real-time but with mostly hack and slash action. Also, when the player lands a certain number of combos on an enemy and they glow blue and yellow you can perform special Rengeki moves. Rengeki moves get more powerful as you progress through the game. The player also has a morale gauge in the top right corner of your screen. When the gauge is full, the player can perform an Awakening attack with help from his/her party members. There are two types of Awakening attacks, Demon and Beast Awakening. The Demon Awakening lets you unleash powerful magic attacks without using SP (Skill Points). The Beast Awaking makes the player invulnerable to physical attacks for a set period of time while enhancing his/her physical abilities.&amp;#xA;New features added are guilds, arena battles and weapon customization. Guilds are groups people join for various reasons. The player can join at least two this game. Arena battles are basically two teams of three characters battling each other for fun or for championships. Weapon customization can be done with items the player gets on travels or buys in shops to element or status effect to your weapons.</plot>

As is typical in the .hack series, there&apos;s a connection between events in the real world and in the online world and as the story continues Haseo will need to figure out how to save himself and his friends in both worlds. The story is told through a series of cut-scenes as well as by talking with other characters, receiving e-mails, and by finding posts in The World&apos;s online message boards. Since the game is a continuation of the previous game, many of the same locations and dungeons are utilized again.&amp;#xA;The game uses a similar battle system as the previous game; a battle is initiated by running into an enemy that&apos;s visible on screen where you will then be able to perform a variety of attacks on the enemies in real time. Once again you can perform special Rengeki moves after performing a series of combo attacks which inflict additional damage. Also available are several awakening attacks which are the most powerful. During a battle you may have up to three members in your party fighting, though you only control Haseo while the other two characters are computer controlled. Experience points are earned for a successful battle which help your characters level up and become more powerful; a variety of missions, side quests, and dungeons are available allowing for numerous monsters of varying levels to fight.</plot>

Player&apos;s once again control Haseo, a player-killer killer in the fictional online role playing game &quot;The World&quot;. The game&apos;s story continues from where Volume 2 left off. AIDA, a deadly virus, continues to cause trouble in both the online world and the real world. Haseo will need to figure out the truth behind the virus and defeat it in order to save himself and his friends. As with the previous games, the story unfolds through a series of cut scenes as well as by e-mails you&apos;ll receive and by reading The World&apos;s online message boards. Since the game is a continuation of the previous installments, many of the locations, dungeons, and characters return along with several new dungeons and characters. If you have completed the previous games, data can be transferred in when you start this volume giving you an advantage.&amp;#xA;The game uses a battle system which is similar to the previous games; it is in real time and is activated after Haseo comes in contact with an enemy while exploring The World. Up to three members of your party may join a battle; the player always controls Haseo while two additional members are computer controlled. Simple orders can be given to the computer controlled characters to guide their actions. Once again several attacks are available including a regular attack, charge attack, and various skills. After performing a series of combos, Rengeki attacks are available which inflict more damage. The most powerful are awakening mode attacks which require a certain amount of points on your morale gauge. New to this game is Avatar Awakening which replaces the Divine Awakening from the previous game. Avatar Awakening allows you to use the power of your avatar to perform Data Drain on your opponents which will be particularly useful in fighting the virus. Successfully winning battles will earn experience points which allow Haseo and other characters to level up and become more powerful. Many missions, side quests, and dungeons are available with various enemies to fight and to help continue the story.</plot>

Under the Union&apos;s protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim&apos;s sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim&apos;s vengeance burns over the enemy...&amp;#xA;The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon&apos;s movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences.&amp;#xA;Levels that have been visited before might become &quot;Expedition Missions&quot; which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim&apos;s choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.</plot>

In the eighteen years since, the Union has taken rule over the land and made prisoner the former soldiers of the Empire&apos;s forces. The priestess child Mannah has grown and lives in the company of these imprisoned forces. Among the Union forces, the Knights of the Seal were formed in dedication to the protection of the magical seals. General Oror of the Knights was on a campaign in the wilds when he came across a young boy, named Nowe, who was cared for and able to talk to the Blue Dragon, Legna. Deciding to raise the boy as his son, Oror brought both Nowe and Legna back to the Union. The Hierach leader, Seere, recognized Nowe&apos;s potential and dubbed him &quot;The Savior&quot;. Over time, Nowe grew up among the knights and aspired to join their ranks. Now finally after many years and training, Nowe is ready to formally become a member of the Knights of the Seal...&amp;#xA;Drakengard 2 is a 3rd person role-playing action game like the first title. The player controls Nowe on his quest, as well as other characters who join him along the way. The game is separated into two modes: Aerial combat and Ground combat. In Aerial Combat, Nowe rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Nowe, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. Each type of weapon can only be equipped by a specific character, and so changing to a new weapon type will also change the playable character from Nowe to another member of his party. These weapons are leveled up, gaining new combos and more powerful magic, through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Accessories and items, such as healing and magic restorers, can also be found and used during combat. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Nowe is able to defeat enemies and earn experience. Defeated enemies drop items and coins, though weapons are only found in treasure chests. In ground combat, Nowe may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon&apos;s movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile.&amp;#xA;Progress in the game is shown on the world map. Levels that have been visited before might become &quot;Expedition Missions&quot; which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons.

Now, with his driving skills, he seeks revenge against the police department for having to serve time for something someone else should&apos;ve gone to prison for!&amp;#xA;Unlike Driv3r, Driver: Parallel Lines mostly takes place behind the wheel, returning back to the formula that made the first game a classic. The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there&apos;s no reason to exit your vehicle unless it&apos;s damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game&apos;s missions involve cop car chases. If that&apos;s the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else&apos;s vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they&apos;re dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat.&amp;#xA;The game takes place in both 1978 (before TK went to prison) and in 2006. The 2006 setting has a much more modern soundtrack than the 1978 setting, which has a mostly disco soundtrack. Obviously, the 2006 setting has the architecture, technology, and cars of today.</plot>

He can also perform different attacks like the Breath Attack.&amp;#xA;In order to advance, there are a variety of puzzles for our heroes to solve.

  <plot>Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends is a stand-alone expansion to Dynasty Warriors 3. In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as &quot;Musou Mode&quot;), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties).&amp;#xA;The difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn&apos;t play as in the original. There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.</plot>

  <plot>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way.&amp;#xA;They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors.&amp;#xA;Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win. Each character has their own unique weapon type and magic ability, although they can share weaker variations of weapons with other characters who use the same style of weapon. Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.&amp;#xA;Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode. An encyclopedia is included as well that details every event and character from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even those that never appear in Dynasty Warriors 3.</plot>

  <plot>Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires is a strategy-oriented variant of Dynasty Warriors 4, mixing it with gameplay similar to Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The heart of the game, campaign mode, begins by choosing any of 24 regions and 42 rulers (custom characters can be created). Beginning with a small kingdom, the ultimate goal is the conquering of all others. Each turn, the player is given a choice from 4 different governing options (brought to your attention by your generals) followed by a single decision of action. These actions typically include the invasion or defense of a specific province or the option to aid an allied empire with those same actions.&amp;#xA;In any battle, be it offense or defense, the player chooses up to three generals and three lieutenants and their troops to form the army. Soldiers fill the battlefield with different ranks and styles (normal, archers, guards, sorceresses and 2 types of siege weapons) as well as horses which can be riden. The player, in 3rd person perspective, may guard, parry, attack, charge, fire arrows, jump, announce or charge up to unleash a special musou attack. All generals and lieutenants are displayed on the map and may be attacked or challenged. Enemy characters who are defeated enough times in a battle can be challenged to a duel. The obvious goal of the battlefield is to control strongholds at strategic points that will make it easier to defend or reach a certain area or opponent. At any given time, these stronghold areas are under control of either of the two sides. They are won by defeating all of the opposing forces in the immediate area. Strongholds routinely generate health recovery items. The winner of a offensive action can win territory and capture enemy soldiers. Each province under control of an empire nets that empire 100 gold each turn which may be spent on various governing decisions.&amp;#xA;The game also features a 2-player mode where players compete against one another in 4 different styles: Defeat more enemies (Vanquish), Collect more treasure (Pilfer), Knock more enemies off a wall (Melee) and a test of survival (Endurance). The game also features unlockable art galleries and data that can be imported from either Dynasty Warriors 4 or Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends.</plot>

  <plot>Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player&apos;s structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen. There are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent&apos;s tower first wins. Compared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode.

Instead of just voice, there is a virtual Chris Berman, who does an introduction to each game, a half-time report, and a post-game show. To illiustrate certain points, he uses replays from each game. Every move you pull off of every quarter of every game is saved and used in these replays (Xbox only). Suzy Kobler gives reports from the sideline.&amp;#xA;One new feature is the V.I.P. system, which keeps track of how you play the game. If you pass 80% of the time, and run 20% of the time, your V.I.P. profile will reflect this. At a later time, you can play against your V.I.P., and the AI will play as if it were you.&amp;#xA;ESPN celebrates it&apos;s 25th anniversary this year, and as such, a special 25th Anniversary Mode has been added. This mode allows you to play moments from classic football games, including The Heidi Bowl and The Immaculate Reception.&amp;#xA;The Crib has an overhaul this year. Instead of earning specific items by completing tasks, you earn points, which you can use to buy items of your choice. New to the Crib is a dart board, as well as a phone, which you will use to answer calls from celebrities. You may get a call from Steve-O, Carmen Electra, Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette or Funkmaster Flex, challenging you to a game.&amp;#xA;Franchise mode also gets an overhaul. New to 2005 is the ability to schedule weekly preps for your team. You can choose to have players work out, play practice games, watch tapes, all in an effort to gear your team up for the next game.&amp;#xA;ESPN NFL 2K5 can be played over Xbox Live, with future support for leagues. The game is also &quot;always connected&quot;, as long as you have an internet connection. This allows it to keep buddy lists up to date, see friends, receive requests, all the time, whether you&apos;re actually playing an online game or not. Roster updates will be available in the future.</plot>

The most extensive mode in the game is the franchise mode. This mode allows you to play one season after another and comes complete with a draft and off-season player dealings, like signing and releasing players, governed by the real rules of the NFL, where trade deadlines and salary caps are standard.&amp;#xA;Another new feature in ESPN NFL Football is a virtual apartment called &apos;The Crib.&apos; The Crib serves as a showcase for all of the bonus items and awards you win by completing objectives. The objectives range from simple accomplishments, like looking at certain things in the game&apos;s menu, playing for one hour, and playing for five hours, to big play accomplishments, like returning a punt or kick for 99 yards or completing a game without dropping any passes. With every completed objective, you earn a trophy or item that you can use to decorate your crib. The items range from different-looking furniture, like couches and bar stools, to bobble heads and in-game cheats. You can also find hidden free agents, like Michael Irvin, and posters and soundtracks from old Sega games, like Jet Set Radio and previous NFL 2K games.&amp;#xA;Another feature added to this game is first-person football. This setup was created to give you a virtual experience of what it&apos;s like playing on the field.&amp;#xA;Chris Berman again adds ESPN style commentary for the audio track.</plot>

  <plot>ESPN NFL Primetime 2002 is the first football game to combine the NFL license with the ESPN license. This NFL adaptation boasts a comprehensive franchise mode that introduces some innovations in this standard mode. One of these is a draft ticker, which puts your team on the clock each time it selects a player in the draft. With the draft ticker on, it is important to scout college players beforehand and analyze draft positions and team needs in order to preselect your team&apos;s draft candidates. In simulated games, NFL Primetime gives a variety of coach options. Here you can customize your team&apos;s aggressiveness level in offense and blitz tendencies and even set spies on more mobile quarterbacks for simulated games. Naturally, there are also obvious franchise mode options such as the ability to draft, trade, and sign/release free agents over multiple seasons.&amp;#xA;The game also provides the standard football modes of exhibition and season play.&amp;#xA;The cutscenes between plays give the game a TV-style presentation, which borrows graphics from the ESPN Primetime show.&amp;#xA;Chris Berman and his Primetime sidekick, Tom Jackson, provide the commentary during games.</plot>

  <plot>ESPN NHL 2K5 is the second hockey game using Sega&apos;s partnership with the worldwide leader in sports, ESPN.&amp;#xA;As with any sports game, you get the standard game modes. 2K5 has a vastly improved Franchise mode over last year&apos;s game. In addition to the e-mail system that was introduced, you have the ability to hire several coaches. You can choose a head coach, offensive coach, defense coach, scouting coach, a goaltending coach and more. When it comes time to hire and fire players, you use actual money, and not points to negotiate contracts.&amp;#xA;There are a few special game modes as well. You have access to the skills mode, which was also found in last year&apos;s game. You can choose accuracy shooting, puck control, hardest shot, fastest skater, and a few more. There is also a Party Mode, which is set up for one to four players (you and friends or you and the computer), which pits you in fast action games. An example is a free-for-all, where you have to get the puck and score it in the net while the constantly moving cinder wall, which blocks the net, is down.&amp;#xA;Like last year&apos;s game, 2K5 features multiplayer hockey over Xbox Live (Xbox) and PlayStation 2&apos;s network service. You can jump into a game, or create or join a league of friends and foes.&amp;#xA;The Skybox is back, and it&apos;s been slightly improved. Like in ESPN NFL 2K5, you earn points by completing tasks, such as scoring five goals in a single period, winning ten faceoffs, etc. You then use these points to purchase unlockables which will adorn your Skybox or allow you to play as special teams. You can also unlock retro jerseys. Once you win a trophy, it&apos;s added to your Skybox, with the Stanley Cup being the center of attention. There are three mini-games you can play from your Skybox; air hockey, shuffleboard, and a trivia machine.&amp;#xA;For those who have an Xbox, you will have the ability to import the music on your harddrive and set songs (or bits of songs) to play for various events. You can choose to play something like Ozzy Osbourne&apos;s &amp;quot;Crazy Train&amp;quot; for the stadium intro, something uplifting for when you score or something insulting for when you get scored on. If you like doing a lot of work, you can even set different events depending on the stadium, so if you want &amp;quot;Crazy Train&amp;quot; to play in Anaheim for the stadium intro, but want &amp;quot;Dragula&amp;quot; in Detroit, you can.</plot>

  <plot>A simulation of the TV game show of the same name. Two families will compete against each other to choose the most common answers to questions such as &quot;Things a jockey needs&quot;, or &quot;Clothes that don&apos;t go on hangers&quot;. More than 1000 questions are included.&amp;#xA;The 2006 edition has both standard and quick games. The standard game contains 5 rounds. In rounds 1-4, two people are selected, one from each team, who compete to buzz in a common answer to the question on the board. The team that wins control then has to figure out the other common answers, earning a strike for any answers that are not common. If any common answers remain after that team&apos;s third strike, the other team has a chance to steal all the points for that round by guessing an unrevealed answer. In rounds 3 and 4, the stakes are higher. In round 5, two people from the winning team work together to find common answers to questions before time runs out. The quick game has just one family, who has to guess the common answers to a question. Finding all answers earns bonus points.&amp;#xA;The standard game can be played against the computer, another player on the same computer, or over the Internet. Answer questions by typing them out or using the on-screen keyboard; the computer will recognize word variations and some misspellings. A family editor is included, which lets you edit body type and clothing. By playing the game, new clothing options and studios will be unlocked.</plot>

Peter makes his way through town beating up anyone who gets in his path, in a side-scrolling beat-em-up fighting mode.&amp;#xA;Brian is falsely accused of impregnating Carter Pewterschmidt&apos;s prized racing dog Seabreeze. Brian must escape the police station without being seen and collect evidence proving that he is not the father. Brian&apos;s game mode relies heavily on stealth/espionage gameplay.&amp;#xA;Stewie&apos;s battle against his half-brother Bertram continues as Stewie must destroy everything in his path to infiltrate a hospital and the inside of Peter in order to find Bertram&apos;s lair and stop him from taking over the world. Stewie&apos;s adventure takes place as a platformer action game with shooting elements.&amp;#xA;Much like the show, there are segues which translate into mini-games that will yield power-ups for each mission if completed successfully.</plot>

  <plot>This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie &quot;Fantastic 4&quot;. Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.&amp;#xA;Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka &quot;Doctor Doom&quot; as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.&amp;#xA;The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.&amp;#xA;To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</plot>

Her brother, Mafuyu, and his mentor, Junsei Takamine, went to investigate a mansion that once was inhabited by a powerful landowner who had absolute control over the area. Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother.&amp;#xA;While inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions. In order to overcome these spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever. Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku.&amp;#xA;In order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura&apos;s shot must first be &quot;charged&quot; by keeping the ghost centered while it is visible. If Miku snaps a shot while the ghost is attacking or is vulnerable then she will drain even more energy from it, resulting in more spirit points being earned. Points can then be spent to improve her camera&apos;s attributes or give it special abilities, like slowing a ghost or pushing it away. The Camera Obscura can also reveal clues and dispel illusions, which Miku will need to utilize to solve puzzles within the mansion.&amp;#xA;The Xbox &quot;Director&apos;s Cut&quot; rerelease contains eleven new ghosts (only one of which must be fought), new unlockable costumes, a new difficulty level, and an additional ending.</plot>

  <plot>The 2008 edition of the long-running EA FIFA football franchise improves upon the gameplay and the features of the previous installments. It is the first game in the series to appear on the Wii and the PS3. Statistically, it includes 620 licensed teams, 30 national leagues (3 more than in FIFA Soccer 07), with the addition of the Hyundai A-League (Australia), Czech Gambrinus Liga (Czech Republic) and FAI Premier Division (Ireland). As usual, the leagues have been updated with new teams and prominent football countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) have multiple divisions. There are also 23 clubs from around the world not featured in specific leagues.&amp;#xA;Gameplay changes include a revised shooting simulation, where factors such as position, defence, speed, bounce and direction weigh in. This is a continuation of the dynamic shooting meter from the previous version, where the position and a shot power meter make for powerful distance shots. There is also more attention to through-balls, more fluent animations and skill moves, revamped crowd, cheering and stadium animations, and a redesigned tackle system. Next to the known modes, &quot;Be A Pro&quot; is introduced where players take control of a single, fixed player on the field. It is not a career mode, but mainly an alternative way to play the games. Online multiplayer options allow players to form a team of independently controlled players, with 10 human-controlled players at the same time in a single match. The camera is changed for this mode, to constantly keep the specific player, but also the action in focus.&amp;#xA;FIFA Soccer 08 contains licensed music tracks from all around the world. Brazilian player Ronaldinho is the poster boy for this version, only replaced with prominent national players for specific localized versions, especially for the European countries.&amp;#xA;The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions include online interactive leagues, with full national leagues against other players on EA servers. The game also comes with the tools to set up independent multiplayer games and organize tournaments.&amp;#xA;The Wii version comes with the Footii Party mode, hosted by a Mii avatar of superstar Ronaldinho. Using the players&apos; Mii characters there are mini-games of Table Football and Shoot Off. Players can also unlock Ronaldinho to go head-to-head in a skill contest. The controls are completely different from the other versions, dubbed FreeMotion. Through 30 tutorials at the Football Academy, players learn to dribble, shoot, pass and perform tricks with a flick of the wrist. The same depth is offered as in the other versions, with crosses, through passes and distance shots.</plot>

  <plot>FIFA Soccer 11 is a licensed soccer game which allows the player to directly control his athletes. He has various playing modes to his disposal, e.g. single matches, multiplayer or leagues to prove his skill. The most important improvement to FIFA Soccer 10 is the so-called &quot;Personality+&quot; feature which means that players have special attributes, e.g. poacher, which directly influences the variety of movements the player can use and their success rate on the field. The new passing system allows to set the amount of strength the athlete uses for his passing attempt. The career mode know includes the option to eventually become a manager or trainer - the player also can choose to play as goalkeeper for the first time. Other smaller changes are the possibility to incorporate own fan songs and the new penalty playing mode.</plot>

  <plot>FIFA Soccer 12 is a soccer game in which the player directly controls the athletes. As always, the game offers an extensive license package which allows the player to take control over a real-life team in a real-life championship. However, the career mode is the heart of the game: During up to 15 seasons the player brings his club to the top; either as manager, a single athlete or coach. Every role brings a different set of jobs and challenges to fulfill. The most notable changes in comparison to FIFA 11 (console version) include a new physics engine, a new defending system and the so-called &quot;Pro Player Intelligence&quot; which means athletes are aware of the skills of their athletes and base their decisions on that.</plot>

  <plot>Five game-changing innovations revolutionize artificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and physical play to create a true battle for possession across the entire pitch, deliver freedom and creativity in attack, and capture all the drama and unpredictability of real-world football. All-new Attacking Intelligence infuses players with the most sophisticated artificial intelligence ever achieved. Players have the ability to analyse space, work harder and smarter to break down the defence, and think two plays ahead. Now every touch matters with the most comprehensive and intuitive dribbling system ever developed for the franchise. Inspired by the world&apos;s best player, Lionel Messi, Complete Dribbling enables players to face their opponent and use precise dribble touches combined with true 360° mobility with the ball, so it&apos;s easier to be more creative and dangerous in 1v1 opportunities. FIFA 13 1st Touch Control transforms the way players control the ball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player on the pitch, and creating more opportunities for defenders to win back possession. The second generation of the Player Impact Engine expands physical play from just collisions to off-the-ball battles between players. Defenders can push and pull for position, and utilise their size and strength to force opponents into poor touches and decisions before the ball arrives. FIFA 13 Tactical Free Kicks provides the tools to create dangerous and unpredictable free kicks. Position up to three players over the ball and utilise dummy runs and more passing options to outwit your opponent. FIFA 13 delivers the largest and deepest set of game-changing features in the history of the franchise. Additional features and new modes will be revealed in the months ahead. </plot>

  <plot>Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it&apos;s not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It&apos;s also possible to create all kinds of competitions.&amp;#xA;The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a &quot;light&quot; managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).&amp;#xA;The main gameplay change was the addition of &quot;First Touch&quot; controls. By performing one of the &quot;trick&quot; moves before the player gets possession of the ball it&apos;s possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the &quot;Off The Ball&quot; controls (allows the control of players that aren&apos;t in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged.&amp;#xA;Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums.&amp;#xA;As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11&apos;000 real footballers.</plot>

  <plot>Fight Club is based on David Fincher&apos;s film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk&apos;s novel of the same name. Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting.

There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP&apos;s) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character.&amp;#xA;Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original plot. Both the PS2 and Xbox version have an online multiplayer mode as well.&amp;#xA;The game music has tracks by famous bands such as The Dust Brothers, Limp Bizkit, Korn and Queens of the Stone Age.</plot>

  <plot>Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, a fantasy world which also served as a setting for Final Fantasy Tactics. Two powerful empires, Archadia and Rozaria, are at war. All they care for is victory over the opponent. In order to achieve it more quickly, Archadia invades the small kingdom of Dalmasca. The young prince of Dalmasca falls in battle shortly after his marriage to the beautiful princess Ashe. The king is murdered under mysterious circumstances just before signing a peace treaty with Archadia. The iron rule of the empire is established in the small country...&amp;#xA;You take control of a young thief named Vaan who lives in Rabanastre, the capital city of Dalmasca. Through a series of events Vaan finds himself involved in the political struggle, hoping to avenge the death of his treacherously murdered brother.&amp;#xA;The game differs from its predecessors in many gameplay-related aspects. The traditional turn-based combat engine was replaced by free-flowing battles with real time elements, somewhat similar to western RPGs such as Baldur&apos;s Gate, or Knights of the Old Republic. You are unrestricted in your movements during battles, and there are no separate &quot;battle screens&quot;. You can issue specific commands to your party members, or assign to them combat strategies (called &quot;gambits&quot;). New magic, abilities, and items are bought from stores or found in containers in the world, but before a character can use any of it they have to &quot;buy&quot; a license for it by spending license points earned in combat. In addition to the enemies and bosses found by following the story the player can also accept &quot;Hunts&quot; posted in bars or offered to the player after they show off their prowess. These are optional encounters where the player has to track down and either trap or lure a very powerful monster before defeating it.</plot>

As an earthquake shakes the very foundations of Finny&apos;s home stream, it also shakes the foundations of his fishy life. Now lead by Kappa, the protector of Finny&apos;s home, he must travel throughout the vast seas in order to meet the Masters and collect their statues. One of the most important parts of the game is the hunger meter. Finny must eat fish in order to survive, or else his hunger meter will deplete and he will gradually lose health. He is able to lock onto different fish with a targeting system. He can even eat fish that are larger than him by biting it a certain amount of time. However, he cannot eat lures. In order to escape from fishing humans, he must either break the fishing line or jump out of the water to unhook himself. He&apos;ll also need to avoid other dangers such as alligators and electric eels. The game keeps track of what fish he&apos;s eaten and what lures he&apos;s taken. Other than that, this game has many puzzles to be solved and people to help. You can collect one item at a time to bring them to people that need them. </plot>

  <plot>FlatOut is a driving game where crashing your car can be more fun than racing it. You drive muscle cars around dirt tracks, battle them on destruction derby arenas, and take part in Ragdoll Olympics. That last one may need some explanation. When you crash in FlatOut, your driver (the Ragdoll) is flung through the windscreen, very much like in Rekkaturvat. This feature is used in the Ragdoll sports where the task is to propel the hapless driver as far, as high, or as accurately as possible. On the demolition arena the goal is to wreck other cars before yours is. Simple as that.&amp;#xA;The bulk of the game is racing though and it can be performed in typical quick race and time trial modes in addition to the proverbial career mode. There are also two different handling modes for the cars. Normal mode gives arcade type handling, suitable for gamepads. Professional mode seems to be designed for steering wheel owners and provides very challenging simulator-type handling. Not surprisingly since Bugbear&apos;s previous racing title Rally Trophy was considered to be very challenging, even demanding, simulation.&amp;#xA;Bugbear&apos;s experience with simulation dynamics shows in FlatOut. Almost everything on the track can be run into and it behaves as it should in real life. Or at least as in a car-chase movie. Stuff that cars scatter around are there on the next lap too and cars are gradually dismantled when hit to other cars or solid objects around the track.&amp;#xA;Multiplayer modes are of course great party hits. Depending on platform, FlatOut has hotseat, split screen, LAN, and/or online multiplay modes.</plot>

Every class is also divided into 3 levels. You begin your career in the derby class level 1. Here you drive old, wrecked cars straight from the dump. As you progress to the race class and finally to the street class you can buy better and faster cars which you can then also tune to your needs, like installing a new engine.&amp;#xA;Inside the classes you find different kinds of events: from normal races over Destruction Derbies to stunt events. All of the events feature a fully destructible environment. This is not only eye-candy but is also required to fill up your nitro and handicap your enemies.&amp;#xA;If you get bored of that, you can play one of the 12 mini-games. Like in FlatOut your goal here is to do all kinds of crazy stuff with your driver. You can use him as a football, throw him through burning rings and more.

  <plot>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing is the third Razorworks-developed title in the licensed Ford Racing series since they took over development in Ford Racing 2. Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.&amp;#xA;There are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.&amp;#xA;Racing or completing challenges earns credits, which can be spent to buy new vehicles in the showroom. Despite the urban theme, there are no tuning options. Cars can only be viewed, repaired and sold.&amp;#xA;The PSP version adds 6 new Ford cars (1962 Thunderbird Sports Roadster, 1971 Mustang Mach 1, 2004 Bronco Concept, 2005 Shelby GR-1 Concept, 2005 SVT Sport Trac Adrenalin Concept, 2005 Thunderbird) and 7 new tracks. In the Team Racing mode, two cars can be controlled (3 in the console versions) and solo and team multiplayer is supported over Wi-Fi.&amp;#xA;There is also an alternate Australian PS2 release Ford Street Racing (XR Edition), with 4 additional cars synonymous with the history of Ford in Australia: the 1970 Ford XY GT Falcon, the 1970 Ford XY GTHO Falcon (Phase III), the 2003 Falcon XR8 Ute and the Australian Falcon XR8. That version is also the only PSP version released in Australia.</plot>

  <plot>Freekstyle is a EA Sports&apos; take on motocross racing. This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks. There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first. The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total.&amp;#xA;The racing game, or &quot;Freekstyle&quot; mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into &quot;freakout&quot; mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.&amp;#xA;Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</plot>

The European Community is enjoying a period of relative peace when it is surprised by sudden attacks on German bases from a mysterious force. To investigate, it is decided to send the EC Armor Tactics Research Corps, also known as &quot;Durandal&quot;. Inside the Durandal, a young new recruit, Elsa soon finds herself caught in an international plot. Meanwhile, the nation of Venezuela, is attempting to secede from the Unified Continental States (U.C.S.). UCS Forces are sent in to restore order and dispose of Governor Diaz. During a routine patrol, Sgt. Darril and his patrol witness a cargo plane being shot down. Heading to investigate, they soon discover it was a plane carrying part of Diaz&apos;s gold. For demoralized UCS soldiers like Darril, this smells like opportunity...&amp;#xA;Front Mission 4 is a turn based strategy game where the plot switches between two different theaters of operation: Elsa and Darril. Controlling the wanzer forces of either character, the story progresses simultaneously. Most battles take place on an overhead map divided into a Player phase and an Enemy phase. Typically a wanzer can move once and use his remaining Action Points (AP) to fire on the enemy or use an ability. Success in battle earns Experience Points, which are traded in for new abilities, such as Rapid Fire or Evasion bonuses. Each character has a set limit of Skill slots, which are filled up differently by abilities. While each character starts with a preference in skills, there is no limitation on what any pilot can learn. Money, found during on the map (along with items) or earned after a successful battle, can be used to upgrade wanzers and purchase new weapons.</plot>

A civil war begins to unfold and various insurgencies fight against the Western forces. Even ethnic hostilities erupt in violence. So once again squads of US Light Infantry are send into the country to secure the Tien-Hamir (or &quot;Ten Hammers&quot;) Province. But this time they can call upon the assistance of the British elements of the Coalition Forces.&amp;#xA;Like in Full Spectrum Warrior you are the commander of two Fire Teams called Alpha and Bravo. But now you can brake down a Fire Team to a Buddy Team consisting of the Team Leader with the Automatic Rifleman and the Grenadier with the Rifleman. In some missions you also have now access to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle which you control just like you control a fire team. In some missions you&apos;ll also find tanks or APCs which your Fire Teams can enter and use.&amp;#xA;You can now also give orders to a specific teammate. So if you want to breach a door, you order the Grenadier to unpack the rocket launcher and make a nice hole. It is also possible to give orders to the Fire Team you don&apos;t control right now.&amp;#xA;Unlike the first game, Ten Hammers doesn&apos;t feature a separate tutorial but you rather learn how to play in the very first mission.&amp;#xA;The twelve missions of the campaign feature several different objectives like reaching a convoy or destroy a street barrier. Since your squads can now enter buildings you have a whole new tactical layer to use against the many foes that hide in the shadows ready to kill you. To support this new feature, you can now also deploy a sniper in a building and activate the sniper mode in which you can take out the enemies one by one.&amp;#xA;The multiplayer-mode also got updated and features now the ability to play cooperatively with four friends or do a few 2-on-2 objective based missions.</plot>

You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can&apos;t directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy.&amp;#xA;The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that&apos;s split up into several areas. You&apos;ll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role.&amp;#xA;Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign.

The game is, in a way, endless because achieving leading Jockey status is not the end of the game - the player can continue playing season after season after season ... Very early on the player acquires an agent who gives advice on tactics and career development. The player is not guaranteed races on good horses until they have experience. Initially they must bid for races on unproven horses and impress the trainers by finishing higher in the standings than predicted. All races are viewed from the traditional rear, &apos;jockey&apos;s backside&apos; point of view though the L1/R1 buttons do provide a sideways view and, when held down continually a rear view. During the race the player has to balance four things - the overall speed of the horse, the stamina, horse motivation, and the potential, which affects for how long the horse can keep the speed high after all stamina was lost. By using the whip on both left and right the horse can be raised to it&apos;s &apos;Go&apos; state - motivated for the final surge.

It&apos;s impossible to raise all four at once, so players must have a well defined strategy to succeed.&amp;#xA;Depending on their abilities, each horse might be better suited for a particular strategy or type of race, and each must be treated differently to achieve the best possible result. The game features a large roster of horses, and many tracks to choose from, including flat track and steeplechase races. Game modes include race training, a tutorial, two player mode, and the career mode, where the player starts as a rookie jockey, and must complete races and training sessions to attract the attention of better stables.</plot>

  <plot>Similar to a cartoon racer at first glance, the Gadget Racers game world is vibrant, colourful and light-hearted. The game&apos;s racing locales are nothing to shout about visually, and are not to be compared with the likes of Gran Turismo - it&apos;s not that kind of game. Environments are simple, quirky and are obviously designed for a younger audience. The game itself is massive, covering some 60 circuits - some easy, some notoriously difficult. You&apos;ll be able to choose from a large selection of more than 50 cars, with which you&apos;ll race against nine others on land and water. In order to make your car suitable for the game&apos;s many hazards, a trip to the body shop is recommended. Here, players can outfit their racers with a variety of car modifications. Aspects such as tyres and steering can be altered and gearboxes, breaks and engines can be tweaked for maximum performance as well. Varying weather conditions can make races a little unpredictable, but it&apos;s the racing skills of the player and decisions in the garage that will make the difference between victory and failure. Gadget Racers is pure, unadulterated fun. Kids will love it.</plot>

However, the computer&apos;s mind told her the humans must be destroyed as weak, imperfect beings, and a race of super-humans, the Galerians, must be created. But Rion, the hero of the first game, destroyed Dorothy in a dramatic battle. Now Rion is brought back to life and learns that Dorothy was able to execute a destructive program before her death. Once again, Rion must face and defeat Dorothy&apos;s creations, the Galerians.&amp;#xA;&quot;Galerians: Ash&quot; is an action-adventure along the lines of Resident Evil and other survival horror titles. Rion can fight enemies using various psychic techniques. The more he uses a technique, and the more damage he sustains, the more &quot;addicted&quot; he becomes, and when the addiction meter reaches the limit, his hit points get gradually depleted, and he cannot walk normally anymore. Like in other survival horror games, you rely heavily on healing and restoring items. Enemies also drop items that would raise Rion&apos;s maximum hit points or make his weapons stronger, in a RPG-like fashion.</plot>

Despite his natural laziness, he decides to rescue his on-and-off girlfriend, along with Odie. Based on the comics and incorporation the known sense of humour, Garfield and Odie travel through a 3D world solving puzzles that involve doors, keys, but also team-based actions with your partner. Of course there are enemies to defeat, such as bad dogs and evil piranhas.&amp;#xA;Next to the regular moves, Garfield can also gain special powers based on his eating habits: big burger kicks, healing lasagna, etc. You cannot control Odie, who is invincible, directly, unless a second players hops in, but you can give him orders by whistling or kicking him. You can even travel over water by standing on his head. During gameplay, important story elements are told through comic strip-style panels to show you what Garfield cannot see (for instance to show you a switch between a well, or a hidden door). You can then take the appropriate action (it usually involves kicking Odie) to solve these problems.</plot>

  <plot>A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal.&amp;#xA;This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.&amp;#xA;There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you&apos;ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes.&amp;#xA;Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird&apos;s eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.&amp;#xA;While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</plot>

Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.&amp;#xA;This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack&apos;n&apos;slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.&amp;#xA;Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.&amp;#xA;The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.&amp;#xA;The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature.

  <plot>Genji: Dawn of the Samurai is a third-person action role-playing game (RPG) set in medieval Japan around the 12th century. At the time, a clan called the Heishi has conquered most of Japan through supernatural means. These means refer to magical stones called the Amahagane which bring supernatural powers (called the Kamui) to the wearers. The hero of this saga is a young man called Yoshitsune, a samurai who also possesses an Amahagane. The game starts when young Yoshitsune is attacked by the Heishi as they are searching for other Amahagane stones. The fate of the world depends on those who controls these magical stones and at that moment, the Heishi seem invincible as they posses most Amahagane. Later in the story, the player acquire a second hero, the giant warrior monk Benkei, who also owns an Amahagane. The story then revolves around the struggles of these two unlikely heroes against the tyranny of the Heishi clan.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is standard click-and-slash action. The player may either control Yoshitsune or Benkei in alternating turns. The unique side of this game is the use of the Amahagane, enabling the player unleash powerful blows at the enemy, particularly useful against multiple foes. The more powerful the Amahagane, the slower enemies become when the Amahagane is activated. Timing is of the essence as the player must attack at the exact moment indicated by the game or the move will fail.</plot>

The player takes control over one of twelve contestants which all live in a free accessible apartment. Every twenty days they are judged by a jury and the worst one gets eliminated from the show. The judgment is based on three character stats: styling, self confidence and popularity.&amp;#xA;Popularity gets improved by talking with the other contestants. Here the player has to choose between three sentences, two mean and a nice one. Of course just the nice one improves the stat. The styling is divided into clothes, make up and hairstyle. In each one the player receives a reference and needs to shape his model after it. Then this gets judged by the game and it tells one false aspect. Every try costs one day. The last stat, self confidence, gets raised by answering trivia questions about fashion styles and successful photo shoots. These are mini games where the player needs to emulate movements with his input device.</plot>

Players have to sing along with the songs as a version plays sung by an amateur singer and the lyrics scroll along on the screen. The singer&apos;s voice is adapted based on the player&apos;s timing, pitch is not taken into account. The songs are not sung by the original performers, but re-recorded. Scoring is based on the overall timing of the words. The words do not have to be sung correctly. It also registers when random noises are made as long as the timing is correct. As it mostly consists of rap songs, there is a bar and spacing between the words to provide help with the lyrical flow, along with a moving color highlighting the words. Songs can be sung in three difficulty levels. When performing well, a meter is filled up until the rock the mic sequence is activated, adding snow to the location or money falling from the sky. In the main career mode the player has to make his way up to sing in better venues (starting in the bathroom) with eleven in total. Money earned along the way can be spent on items to customize the character or to buy a mansion and decorate it. Other modes are exhibition (sing any song) and practice (similar to exhibition but without scoring). In the freestyle mode players can rap freely over the beats without the regular vocals. There is also a multiplayer freestyle mode where another player uses the controller to judge the freestyle. There are different characters to choose from, each with their own poses and animations.</plot>

  <plot>Ghost Master: The Gravenville Chronicles is the console version of the PC game Ghost Master. In this strategy game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels, usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters, that match their type.&amp;#xA;By scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is figuring out each human&apos;s weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can detect and ban your ghosts.&amp;#xA;The game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the game&apos;s pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate ghost for each situation.</plot>

Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters. There are some shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them. There is also a spirit gauge, which is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking. It allows the uses of special moves, like your shotgun.&amp;#xA;There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the bike&apos;s hellshots attacks and your chains.</plot>

  <plot>An official sequel to the two Ghostbusters movies, Ghostbusters: The Video Game puts the player in control of Rookie, the unnamed newest member of the Ghostbusters. Shortly after being hired a mysterious ghostly shock wave flows through New York City, prompting the Ghostbusters to begin an investigation. Over the course of the game they will return to many locations from the movies and meet returning characters as well as some new locations and characters.&amp;#xA;As the Rookie the player must explore levels to find and capture any ghosts while being assisted by fellow Ghostbusters following you. A ghost must first be weakened using any of the proton pack weapon modes it is vulnerable to, then by dragging the stunned ghost to a trap placed by the player or their teammates. Other enemy types must be defeated by first revealing a weak point and then pulling it out with the proton pack&apos;s blast stream, or by simply dealing enough damage to the enemy. If the Rookie takes too much damage themselves they will be knocked unconscious, and their allies will attempt to get to them and help them back up. The Rookie can do the same if any of their allies are knocked unconscious, and if all current members of the team are knocked down the game will return to the last checkpoint. Information about enemies and objects in the world can be obtained by scanning them, and concept art for the entries can be added by finding hidden pages in the levels. The Rookie receives upgrades to their proton pack automatically over the course of the game, and by finding enough scanner entries they can increase their health.&amp;#xA;Ghostbusters: The Video Game on the Wii and PS2 shares the same story, level settings, and most of the dialogue of the XBOX360/PS3/Windows version, but it also has several departures. Levels are condensed, redesigned, and occasionally completely removed. The art assets were changed to a cartoon-like style, and some bosses were redesigned as a result. While this version lacks an online mode, the Wii release does allow two players to play through story mode in co-op, something impossible in the high definition version. Finally the player has the option of playing a female Rookie, although this has no impact on the story (and some characters still refer to the Rookie as being male).</plot>

Levels are traveled through sequentially and range from flooded bayous to a sunken battleship and abandoned prison island. Sometimes Lazarus will be assisted by a mute ghost named Astral who can reach areas beyond Lazarus and open paths for him.

Each species various in the way they play the game and have vastly different types of attacks available to them.&amp;#xA;Giants is a action/real-time-strategy game that emphasizes action. While there is base-building and resource management for most of the races, it is a done through a simple to control interface and one or two keystrokes. The majority of the game will be spent in a third person view (first person mode is available) jet-packing/warping/leaping about the well rendered 3D landscape. Single player sessions consist of missions with specific goals, such as resucing Smarties or recovering lost items. Multiplayer options include standard deathmatch, capture the Smartie (flag), the above with basebuilding as an option.&amp;#xA;Other creatures also inhabit the islands. From the meek Smarties (who are employed to build your bases or eaten as a primary source of protein, depending on your species), to the cow-like vimps to the deadly rippers, the fauna of the planet will either try to kill you or avoid being killed/eaten/captured. While not so energetic, the floral of the islands can be crushed, knocked over, or burned in careless combat (or by Kabuto not paying attention).&amp;#xA;Game controls are similar to Shiny&apos;s MDK and can best be described a simplified shooter interface. You can run, jump, turn, shoot, and strafe. Beyond that, a half-dozen keystrokes are all you need to play (and some, like Kabuto&apos;s howls, are for fun and show).&amp;#xA;Trying to break away from the dark and moody nature of many recent games, Planet Moon made this alien world bright and full of vibrant colors. A great number of graphic options are available, most of them only will work on high-end video cards. In addition, the game tries to maintain a humorous streak. The single player game has goofy dialogue and a few jokes spread along its story line and even the multiplayer is lighthearted, with Smarties cheering you on as you carry them on your back, among other little sounds and nuances.</plot>

  <plot>Go Go Golf is a player golfing game for one to four, where there&apos;s only one human player the game provides the opposition. The player(s) play as one of eight predefined golfing characters, each with their own strengths, on three golf courses which can be played in three ways: Stroke Play: here the match is played over eighteen holes and the player who completes the round in the fewest strokes wins Match Play: where it is the player who wins the most holes who takes the match, here if a player is, say, five holes ahead with just four remaining they are declared the winner Tour: Here the objective is to win more than $1.5m in one season. In order to achieve this the player must win a qualifying match in May so that they can compete in a major tournament. There are four major golfing tournaments in Japan in June and July, two nationals the All Japan Masters and the Asian Open, and two internationals the International World Classic and the World Classic. By winning the nationals the player can progress to the internationals and the big prize money. Games can only be saved during a tour The game has an unusual, one button, style of gameplay. Cross is used to initiate a stroke. As the player shapes up to take their swing a shadowy outline appears behind them and the player must press Cross again at, or near to the top of the swing, the game does not allow Cross to be used beyond the top of the swing. On the downswing the player must press Cross again at the point of impact. With each press during the back and down strokes the player sees a message ranging from &quot;Too Fast&quot;; &quot;A Bit Too Fast&quot;, &quot;Correct&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot;; Amazing Skill&quot;, through to &quot;Too Slow&quot; and others. Club selection is automatic and the player cannot make their own shots, with most approach strokes the player has a choice of three shots to play and on the green there is only one shot option. There is no course or hole flyby in this game, no gimme&apos;s, no mulligan&apos;s, and no character creation. Neither the eight players nor the three courses are based on anyone or anywhere in real life. In-game the player can view the ground ahead before they play their shot but all camera viewpoints are automatic. All matches are played over eighteen holes, none of that &apos;front nine&apos;, &apos;back nine&apos; rubbish here.</plot>

When he comes to, he finds himself with a young girl at his side, and his right arm reattached. But this is no longer an ordinary arm: it&apos;s been replaced with the legendary &apos;God Hand&apos;, and now that he&apos;s got it, Gene&apos;s on the hunt by every demon in the county, as they all want their hands on his. And with four powerful figures planning the demise of the world, things are probably gonna get ugly.&amp;#xA;God Hand is a Western action-based game where you, well, punch enemies in the face repeatedly with an incredibly powerful fist. Trying to explain the button configuration in God Hand is tough - the player can completely customize their attacks to their liking, as well as earning new ones. You can choose to set up a combo for four presses of the square button (choosing each attack for each press), or select your more powerful special attacks and juggles. By moving the right Analog Stick, you&apos;ll also perform a dodge in that direction. Sometimes, stunning an enemy will cause a &quot;press this button&quot; icon to appear on-screen (somewhat like God of War, if you perform well at this bonus prompt, you&apos;ll deal some extra damage to the enemy.&amp;#xA;Once you&apos;ve wailed on enemies enough with your regular fists, your &apos;Tension Gauge&apos; will become full and you can press R2 to use the God Hand itself. This will make you completely invincible, more powerful and speed you up for a brief time. You also have the option to use &apos;Roulette Moves&apos;, which use a special attack depending on the one you have selected.&amp;#xA;Like all good Westerns, God Hand also features a Casino. In here, you can gamble your life away, by your choice of the slots, video poker, or blackjack. Cash earned at the Casino can be used to purchase all sorts of moves for Gene as well as other power ups.</plot>

  <plot>God of War is set in the age of ancient Greek myths. The hero of the game is a mortal warrior Kratos. Long time ago, Kratos was the leader of Spartans, a fearless and brutal general who waged wars for the glory of his city. Today, he is known as the Ghost of Sparta. For the past ten years, he is tormented with terrible nightmares, unable to forget the tragedy that happened in his past. He has to serve the gods of Olympus, who promised to forgive his sins if he becomes their champion. Finally, the goddess Athene tells Kratos that redemption will be granted to him if he defeats her brother, the god of war Ares, who was the very reason for the tragic event of his past...&amp;#xA;Kratos has two default swords that he will always carry with him called the Blades of Chaos. They allow you to perform combos, which will constantly climb until you can no longer fight (you&apos;ve killed everyone in the area), or you take too long to register another hit. The higher your combo total, the more red orbs you get from defeated enemies.&amp;#xA;Similar to Devil May Cry, the red orbs you collect from fallen enemies can be used to purchase upgrades. You can upgrade your default weapons, so that you can learn new moves and strike faster, or you can put the orbs into different weapons acquired throughout the game, such as Blade of Artemis.&amp;#xA;Kratos will, over time, also have access to a selection of magic spells. At specific points in the game, you will be able to generate an arc of electricity, courtesy of Zeus, or you will be able to use the decapitated head of a Gorgon to turn enemies into stone, using Meduza&apos;s Gaze.&amp;#xA;God of War features several unlockable extras, which are only acquired when you beat the game on the different difficulty modes. Most of the features are a behind-the-scenes look at various aspects of the game, such as creating the world, modeling Kratos, and a look at deleted levels that didn&apos;t make the final cut of the game.</plot>

  <plot>The Golden Compass is an adaptation of the 2007 movie of the same, which in turn is based on the novel Northern Lights, the first in the His Dark Materials trilogy by British novelist Philip Pullman.&amp;#xA;The game is set in a fantastical parallel universe where the soul of person resides out of the body and lives in the form of animals known as dæmons. The main character is Lyra Belacqua. Her best friend Roger is kidnapped by evil Gobblers and her uncle Lord Asriel is imprisoned when he discovers evidence that proves the existence of Dust particles, much to the dismay of the Magisterial representatives who rule the world as a dogmatic theocracy and do not allow people to contradict their doctrine. Lyra has to leave the safe haven that is Jordan College in Oxford to right the situation.&amp;#xA;In typical 3rd-person action gameplay, Lyra needs to navigate the different environments. She excels at moving around with acrobatic actions and when enemies appear she relies on her wit, hiding behind objects or searching an escape route. When she is spotted, she can use one of the four collectibles to escape from a tricky situation. Health is represented as &quot;courage&quot; and a large extent of courage helps solving the puzzles. She can also play a Deception mini-game to outwit characters and gain additional courage.&amp;#xA;Two other characters provide assistance her during her quest. The first is Pan, Lyra&apos;s dæmon and the manifestation of her spirit. Pan can transform into up to four different forms, gradually discovered during the quest. The basic Ermine form allows Pan to chew through ropes and reveals the areas where Lyra needs to solve puzzles or move around. The Sloth form introduces swinging to grab hold of branches or reach areas hard to access. The third form, Hawk, lets Lyra glide from great heights. She can also send out Pan in this form to retrieve objects at difficult locations. The final Wildcat form has Lyra slide down from special surfaces, climb nets and it provides a dash move to evade enemies.&amp;#xA;Brute strength is represented by the second support character Iorek Byrnison, an armoured bear known as panserbjørne. He has most of the physical attacks. Next to health (replenished by bloodmoss) he has an armour gauge, filled up by gathering sky armour. Collected rage orbs fill up a rage meter, which introduces a special attack when maxed out. Pan is always by Lyra&apos;s side, while Iorek joins the party later in the game and he is not always present.&amp;#xA;Lyra&apos;s journal stores her tasks, information about key locations and a section for the Alethiometer, the golden compass. It is a device that reveals the answer to any question when operated by a trained user. It contains four needles - three to construct a question and fourth for the answer. To ask questions and solve puzzles, Lyra needs to play the Divining game. It consists of three sessions where Lyra needs to match symbols to keep the focus (a circle of light) centred on the device, by pressing a key or button to spin a hand in a timely fashion. The meaning of the different symbols is revealed during the course of the game, by interacting with objects and characters. Conversations often introduce mini-games to keep the talking going.&amp;#xA;Each of the characters can pick up objects that grant new abilities such as new forms, a slow spell, double damage or more insight into the workings of the Alethiometer.</plot>

  <plot>Long ago, the Gradius army destroyed an evil life form that was threatening the galaxy. But somehow some of the Bacterian cells survived, and a new army has appeared ready to take over the galaxy! The Gradius forces have developed a super spatial-temporal fighter (called the Vic Viper) which you must pilot in order to destroy all of the enemies. The gameplay in Gradius V is an arcade style shooter and is very similar to the other games in the series. You need to guide the Vic Viper through a series of side scrolling screens and destroy the many enemies that appear (including several very large bosses). Although you begin the game with very limited firepower, additional weapons can be acquired. After destroying certain enemies, a power up capsule is left behind; collecting these will advance the weapon selector. When the weapon you want is selected after collecting enough capsules, you can activate it to equip the Vic Viper with that weapon. Your choices are speed up, missiles, double fire, lasers, multiples (these circle the Vic Viper providing additional firepower), and force fields. As you progress through the game, short animated cut scenes will reveal the story, and the enemies become tougher and more numerous. The game is somewhat customizable, allowing you to set the controls, difficulty level, and number of lives you begin with.</plot>

Players can draw different parts of the monster, attach them to each other as they please, add a few accessories, paint the parts and define, which part is a hand, leg or an attacking device.

  <plot>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City offers the same go-anywhere style of play as its violent, M-rated predecessor but in a new setting based on Miami.&amp;#xA;The player takes the role of Tommy Vercetti (voiced by Ray Liotta), a gangster who just got off a fifteen year prison sentence for not squealing on his friends. Because he didn&apos;t rat out his &quot;family&quot;, Tommy&apos;s sent to work with Sonny Forelli, his old boss. Sonny gives him an easy drug job, but everything goes wrong, and Tommy loses everything. Upon returning to Sonny, he gets mad and wants his money back. Unfortunately, everybody in Vice City, from gangsters and Cubans to bikers and politicians are in his way, and it&apos;s up to Tommy to clear a path.&amp;#xA;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City takes everything from Grand Theft Auto III and builds upon it. There are new cars in the game, reminiscent of cars from the 80s. Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from GTA III. New to this game is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to your standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers.&amp;#xA;Weapons are, more or less, the same as in GTA III, but the addition of melee weapons spices combat up a little. Tommy can use riot batons, crowbars, and a few others.&amp;#xA;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City uses celebrity voice talent. The main character is voiced by Ray Liotta of Goodfellas, and the supporting cast is voiced by Dennis Hopper (Speed), Gary Busey (Slapshot 2), William Fitcher, Danny Trejo, Luis Guzman (Traffic), and Jenna Jameson (ex porn star).&amp;#xA;To effectively capture the mood of the 1980s, the soundtrack has been altered to fit the time period. Players will listen to an estimated nine hours of music (nearly three times the amount featured Grand Theft Auto III) across 10 radio stations. The eclectic mix features such noteworthy titles as I Ran by Flock of Seagulls, The Message by Grandmaster Flash, You&apos;ve Got Another Thing Coming by Judas Priest, and Out of Touch by Hall &amp; Oates.</plot>

Set in 1984, players take on the role of Vic Vance, an army soldier who loves his country, family, and himself. One bad decision turns everything around and he is kicked onto the streets of a tough city. He has to build an empire to survive, or be left to die. Together with his brother Lance, a drug addict, the siblings try to take over Vice City.&amp;#xA;Just like other GTA titles, gameplay consists of third-person shooting and driving sequences in an open environment. You will meet new enemies and gangs, and old foes. The missions require you to kill with a selection of weapons, steal vehicles such as a car, a boat, or a plane, rob to make it big, or just to have fun. New features for the portable version include swimming, and side missions such as Air Rescue, Vigilante, Firefighter, and Paramedic.&amp;#xA;Similar to San Andreas&apos; gang wars, this title has an Empire mode. To make money, you have to take over businesses from other gangs. By attacking and damaging rival businesses, it will be put up for sale, for you to take over. With a new building constructed, you can then choose an activity such as prostitution, drugs, protection racket, smuggling, robbery, or work as a loan shark. These activities earn money and the location in the city influences the revenue.&amp;#xA;Multiplayer is available over Wi-Fi with ten different game modes, either focusing on fighting (Vice City Survivor), businesses (Empire Takedown), racing (Street Rage), stealing/selling (Grand Theft Auto), capture the flag game types, or games centered around a single vehicle such as a tank.</plot>

Controlling Ryudo, the player will explore various locations, locating townspeople and objects within an area to interact with. Towns and dungeons are displayed in the same manner, though dungeons tend to be mazes filled with monsters and towns tend to be friendly areas filled instead with conversation and shops. Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player&apos;s party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then the party loses initiative.&amp;#xA;In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that include &quot;attack combos&quot; (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, &quot;Critical Strike&quot;, Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy&apos;s action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy&apos;s) time to act within the battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character&apos;s individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold and items.</plot>

  <plot>Once, an isolated island continent was plunged into war. The people who wished to end the warring revived a powerful weapon called the &quot;Admonisher&quot; and threatened the participants of the war with it. Thus all of the wars were ended by force. The people behind this called themselves the &quot;Peace Maintenance Brigade. 20 years later the old men of the Brigade are no longer able to maintain the peace.&amp;#xA;Now war has once again broken out among the inhabitants of the continent. A mysterious famine has appeared, leaving the citizens to fight over what little fertile land is left, while the cities are constantly attacked by fierce amphibious monsters known as &quot;Screapers&quot;&amp;#xA;Battles take place in real-time, and there is no transition to a separate battle map (which is usually found in traditional Japanese RPGs).

  <plot>When the humans created artificial beings named &quot;gears&quot; in 22th century, they didn&apos;t expect that their creation will eventually turn against them. Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong. Fearing a new Justice will grow out of this gear, the Order organized yet another tournament, this time with a solid prize: five hundred thousand world dollars for the winner.&amp;#xA;&quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; is a follow up to Guilty Gear, and is also a 2D fighting game. There are now 16 characters available for you to choose. The battle system became more complicated, thanks to the variety of moves you can perform.

About 60% of the included tracks are by Aerosmith, while the others have influenced or have opened for the band (Run-D.M.C., The Kings, Lenny Kravitz, ...). Four songs were re-recorded by the band directly for the game and they also performed as motion capture actors for their 3D models. The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.&amp;#xA;The prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band&apos;s history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band&apos;s history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.&amp;#xA;Songs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to Guitar Hero III (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances.

The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.&amp;#xA;The music selection consists of 28 master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band. Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs. Progress is made by completing sets of songs, rather than a series of gigs as in Guitar Hero: World Tour, set in venues that were in important in the band&apos;s career. Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to progress and unlock a new set.&amp;#xA;The game also includes the GHTunes from World Tour where new songs can be created and shared. A new Drum Mode offers the possibility to play the drums without an existing drum track to create new rhythms, and the Battle mode (from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock), has been updated with Metallica influences for the power-ups, with names like Fade To Black, Under The Ice and Ride The Lightning.&amp;#xA;Although released in Europe packaged with a guitar controller and Metallica faceplate, other regions were not so fortunate and only received a solus edition. Custom drumsticks and a second bass pedal were offered as pre-order bonuses in certain stores.&amp;#xA;The Metallica tracklist includes:&amp;#xA;1. All Nightmare Long&amp;#xA;2. Battery&amp;#xA;3.

  <plot>Guitar Hero 5 is the fifth main game in the musical rhythm series. Similar to the previous title, Guitar Hero: World Tour, the focus is on a band-experience, with a lead and bass guitar, drums and vocals. The title is available standalone or bundled with the instruments.&amp;#xA;Next to a new soundtrack with 85 songs, many animated lead singers are now modelled after famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Kurt Cobain, and Matthew Bellamy. Players can still compose their own songs in the included studio and the game relies heavily on downloadable content, through tracks and full albums. A portion of the songs of Guitar Hero: World Tour, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song.&amp;#xA;In the Band Lobby players can assemble a party of local and remore players to form a band, play the Career mode or opt for Quickplay. Most of the competitive multiplayer modes are carried over from former versions, along with two new ones: Party Play (random song selection with the option to join and leave at will using any instrument) and RockFest, a band mode for up to four (local) or up to eight (online) players with a variety of submodes. The songs are divided in smaller portions and for each section the players are rewarded based on a variety of conditions.&amp;#xA;General new features introduced to the gameplay include drop-in/drop-out play, where it is possible to join in the middle of a song or stop playing without interrupting gameplay. There is also a new Challenges section in the Career mode.&amp;#xA;The different game versions are identical, except for the PS2 version that lacks online game modes and downloadable content, drop-in/drop-out play and song challenges. It is also limited to two instruments and the multitap is not supported. The Wii version is very similar to the major console versions, including downloadable content on SD cards, multiplayer through the global Wii address book, and the Mii Freestyle mode from the previous game. It also supports interaction with the Nintendo DS to edit videos and provides access to the Roadie Battle mode, similar to the main battle mode of Guitar Hero III, where players complete mini-games on the Nintendo DS to sabotage the players on the console.</plot>

  <plot>Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s is an incremental title in the Guitar Hero series, using the features and gameplay from Guitar Hero II but with a completely new batch of songs. The game&apos;s theme is the eighties, reflected by the characters and their clothing, the venues and of course the songs themselves. It is the last title in the series developed by the original creators Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.&amp;#xA;As in the previous games, in the single-player mode the player works his way through a setlist unlocking increasingly difficult songs, divided over 4 main difficulties. By performing well, new songs and venues become available, but there are less unlockables compared to the previous titles. Notable bands in this edition include A Flock of Seagulls, The Police, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Asia, Dio and Anthrax. Unlike the previous games, there are no bonus tracks.&amp;#xA;The game is played through the guitar controller introduced for this series. The multi-player modes include Co-op, Face-off and Pro Face-off, identical to the previous game.</plot>

  <plot>Guitar Hero II, the follow-up to the PS2-only game Guitar Hero, expands upon the gameplay and features of the original game. As a wannabe rockstar, you need to play songs by pressing combinations of five fret buttons on a guitar-shaped controller, while working the strum bar, along with an optional whammy bar for distortion. The sequel contains 64 songs, of which 40 have been licensed. One of the tracks was discovered through a contest at beaguitarhero.com, where unlicensed bands could send in a demo to be included in the game. Most of the tracks have been covered in-studio, but a few use original recordings.&amp;#xA;The career mode has been revamped as a high school battle where you need to make your way to the top. Every venue is now represented by a different city. There are also encore performances, and unlockables can still be bought in the shop. A completely new addition is the practice mode (Shred School). When you keep getting stumped by a single track, you can train in this mode. The background music is dropped, you can choose a certain section to practice, and there four types of speeds available, to slowly get the hang of difficult passages.&amp;#xA;In the multiplayer mode, you can still play the traditional mode from the first game, where sections are traded off between players. The co-op mode is new: both players play the same song at the same time, but one is given the lead guitar, while the other handles the bass or rhythm guitar. Unlike the traditional mode, you can fail and both player share the score, rock meter and multiplier. To activate star power (a short power-up mode where the score multiplier is doubled, built up in a meter by playing a number of star-shaped notes without flaws and best saved for difficult sections) both players need to raise the guitar at the same time. You cannot practice together in this mode, but the different sections are available in the singleplayer practice mode. The final mode is called Face-Off. Here, both players play every single note at the same time. In the multiplayer mode, each player can now choose an individual difficulty level. Upon completing Face-Off, Pro Face-Off becomes available, where both players need to use the same difficulty level.&amp;#xA;Other additions are the introduction of three-button chords, the use of hammer-ons and pull-offs (holding one note while playing another and vice versa) is smoother, and the screen now shakes if you break a note streak (only of the side of the player who makes the mistake in the multiplayer mode).</plot>

  <plot>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N&apos; Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features &amp;quot;boss battles&amp;quot; against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.&amp;#xA;In career mode you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.&amp;#xA;The co-op career mode is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs.&amp;#xA;The multiplayer game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.</plot>

  <plot>Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.&amp;#xA;While playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.&amp;#xA;There are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and &quot;boss challenges&quot; where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in Guitar Hero III, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.&amp;#xA;Through the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.&amp;#xA;There are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of Rock Band.</plot>

  <plot>The Wild Wild West meets Grand Theft Auto in this free-roaming action game. Set in 1870, you are Colton White, a young gunslinger whose father is killed by an Indian tribe led by Reverend Reed. Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you.&amp;#xA;The main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear. You will have to fight duels, defend towns against bandits, help build railway tracks, intervene in various conflicts and kill heavily-armed bossed. There are also many side missions or alternative ways to earn money. You can play poker in the casino, help out farmers with their livestock, assist the local sheriff or deliver items with the pony express. Other possibilities include bounty hunting, regular hunting for rare animals, mining for gold and various rescue missions.&amp;#xA;The RPG elements involve acquiring and improving skills, such as QuickDraw (shown in Bullet Time,) Zoom Firing, Melee Combat, improved accuracy, the ability to throw axes and strategically equipping and upgrading different weapons. There are hand weapons (knives, tomahawks, bayonets), archery arms, explosive throwable items and regular guns, such as sharpshooter rifles, colts and winchesters. Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns.&amp;#xA;The GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation: horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness and caves.</plot>

During this, The Resistance is formed in an attempt to stop the SMO, lead by a woman by the name of Lily who is kidnapped when she attempts to help a man by the name of Kou. After she is captured, it is learned the man has come into possession of two ancient pistols by the name of &quot;Crimson&quot; that can destroy the monsters and their vicious leader. Kou sets out with Lily&apos;s daughter, Yuri, to bring her back and stop the evil forces within the city. Death Crimson is a light-gun game similar in style to House of the Dead where the player shoots at enemies that pop up on screen and save innocents from the monsters. The player can also power-up the &quot;Crimson&quot; pistols by shooting death flowers that will turn their firepower into machine guns to decimate hordes of enemies. There is also a health meter that will increase in size by successfully shooting enemies, gaining experience points. Once enough points are obtained, the health bar will increase, however missing enemies or shooting civilians will take away points.</plot>

  <plot>The PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life is a port of the Windows game, but with a significant overhaul for the weapons and character models, as well as the overall map geometry and some extended levels.&amp;#xA;It also includes an expansion pack that is referred to as Half-Life: Decay, which was never officially available as an expansion for the Windows game until it was eventually recreated as a modification. The third expansion for the original game, it features two-player cooperative gameplay (in split-screen) with the two female scientists Gina Cross and Colette Green as the protagonists. It is meant to be played with two players at the same time as it is more puzzle-oriented than the original game and the first two expansions. Singleplayer is also possible, but then switching between the two characters is necessary to advance. When not active, the other character is AI controlled for basic actions.&amp;#xA;It is set at the same time of the events in the original Half-Life, but from the perspective of other characters. All enemies and weapons are based on the original game and many of the missions have a more friendly approach about working together or rescuing NPCs. Unique to the series as a whole is the lack of a single narrative; instead the add-on consists of fixed, separate missions. At the end of each mission, statistics are shown and the player is graded. When the nine levels are completed with an A grade, a bonus mission is unlocked where players control and work together as two Vortigaunts. As an additional bonus, the entire singleplayer can then also be completed as a Vortigaunt.&amp;#xA;The game supports an USB mouse and keyboard for more precise control.</plot>

  <plot>Quidditch, the broomstick and ball &quot;sport&quot; of the Harry Potter world comes to life in this simulation. For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other. For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and &quot;strategies&quot; of Quidditch are faithfully recreated.&amp;#xA;The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for. Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams. As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as &quot;score 120 points in one game&quot;) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves. Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with it&apos;s own style and special combo moves. After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.&amp;#xA;People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings&apos; books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch. Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the &quot;golden snitch bar&quot;. As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar. Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase. Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential).&amp;#xA;Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc...). It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two player (same machine) exhibition matches</plot>

The player takes the role of Harry Potter who has to fight against Lord Voldemort and his minions.&amp;#xA;The game is not completely linear - between the chapters Harry can explore the school at his own leisure. If the player does not want to walk and search around, they have two ways to cut a corner: portraits, which are unlocked during the course of the game, can be used to teleport instantly to another place. Harry can also call a ghost which shows him the fastest way to the next mission. Exploration has mostly one goal: finding the 150 (more or less) hidden crests which unlock achievements and trophies. Because Harry lost his ability to jump and climb, he has to use spells to reach them.&amp;#xA;Mini Games&amp;#xA;The player will spend most of his time in three mini games: magic duels, brewing potions, and quidditch. The duels are used to learn new spells respectively improve the already known. Harry basically faces other magicians and uses his spells to defeat them, e.g. by paralyzing them or by parrying their spells. To perform a spell the player has to use his input device to recreate a certain movement.&amp;#xA;Quidditch is a reaction test. Harry&apos;s broom flies automatically and the player can only slightly move it to fly through rings or avoid obstacles. While brewing potions Harry faces a bowl, ingredients and a time limit. Now he simply needs to recreate the receipt by using the ingredients in the correct on the bowl. Sometimes he needs to heat up the bowl or stir the brew up with his input device. If he makes a mistake there is smoke which costs time.</plot>

Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter&apos;s first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action adventure title.&amp;#xA;After a tutorial at Ollivander&apos;s Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book.&amp;#xA;Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There&apos;s also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.&amp;#xA;After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas: collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry&apos;s health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George&apos;s shop for more cards and some other useful items.</plot>

  <plot>The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion&apos;s people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion&apos;s return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king&apos;s promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven&apos;s dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch&apos; reign.&amp;#xA;Haven is a fast-paced, action-packed platformer but it also incorporates elements of several other genres.&amp;#xA;Haven can pick up many different weapons and parts of the game play more like a Shoot&apos;Em Up than a platformer. There are also several vehicles to control, ranging from speedboats and jetcars to gliders ,spaceships and jetpacks. Despite all these action elements, there are also some slower paced levels, which put more emphasize on puzzle-solving and exploration.&amp;#xA;Haven&apos;s conceptual artwork was done by Rodney Matthews, a fairly well-known English sci-fi/fantasy artist, which is evident in Haven&apos;s surrealistic, bizarre design.</plot>

  <plot>In the 21st century, a dreadful virus wiped out millions. The vaccine was found, but at the time the world was engulfed into chaos. A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below.&amp;#xA;The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below.&amp;#xA;One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he&apos;s not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter&apos;s main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you&apos;ll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking.</plot>

  <plot>Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as &apos;Headhunters&apos; to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry.&amp;#xA;You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you&apos;ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough...&amp;#xA;Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection.&amp;#xA;Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license.&amp;#xA;As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.&amp;#xA;Jack will need to pass LEILA tests in order to grant him access to the equipment dispensers. He starts the game with a standard issue Stimulator Automatic, but can acquire grenades, proximity mines, neurostunners, decoy shells, shotguns and automatic weapons as he progresses. The weapons in the game fire Electric Neural Projectiles (ENP&apos;s) instead of bullets. These cause brain death so as to preserve the internal organs of the person being shot.&amp;#xA;Jack also uses a CASIO Visual Manager to keep in touch with Angela and his former chief at the ACN.

But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso.&amp;#xA;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world.

While there&apos;s a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards.&amp;#xA;The guards aren&apos;t completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they&apos;ll react if they see you waving around a gun. They&apos;ll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they&apos;ll eventually realize you&apos;re not one of their buddies.&amp;#xA;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a &quot;Mass Murderer&quot;, while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the &quot;Silent Assassin&quot; rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.</plot>

  <plot>An evil fallen angel steals the Divine Crystal, one of Heaven&apos;s untouchable treasures. With this crystal he gains the power to control the thoughts of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa, and forces him to occupy Osaka castle and put himself in power using his newfound powers. In Heaven, the leaders of the individual heavenly families form a council with one aim... to regain the Divine Crystal. But they can&apos;t do this alone, so they decide to use the prisoner Homura to aid them. While they don&apos;t want to release him, he is the only one who&apos;s blood is half that of an angel and half human making him immune against the Crystal&apos;s powers. Homura refuses at first, but when he finds out that his mother was one of the victims at Osaka he picks up his sword and is ready to fight once again... Homura is a top-down shoot&apos;em up of the bullet-hell persuasion. The player takes on the role of Homura as he fights his way through 4 levels filled with demons. Each stage has a branching path where Homura can pick which route to take. The paths will meet up at the end of the stage however, so the boss fight will always be the same. There are several ways to dispose of the enemies in the game, where the common one is a projectile attack (as it the norm of the genre). What sets this game apart is Homura&apos;s sword slash technique; When used it makes the enemies&apos; bullets bounce back towards them. The more bullets are slashed at once, the higher the score multiplier will be. The sword slash has to be recharged for a few seconds each time after use. There are also powerful special attacks which will clear the screen of all enemies or do massive damage to bosses. Killed enemies drop money, which is used to fill up a meter. When the meter is full, an &quot;option&quot; helper is added to Homura&apos;s side adding additional fire power. The aspect ratio can be changed in the options menu in a multitude of ways, one of which means placing the screen sideways (for standing the TV on its side) to make it more similar to the original arcade cabinet&apos;s setup. There is also an unlockable art gallery which will have more pictures added to it the further the player makes it through the game.</plot>

  <plot>Ico is a boy with horns. At the age of twelve when his horns grew large enough the elders send him away to be sacrificed to prevent evil spirits from attacking the village. Entombed in a crumbling ancient castle Ico only manages to begin his escape when a freak earthquake shakes loose the vessel he has been locked in.&amp;#xA;Ico shortly meets a Princess named Yorda who has also been imprisoned by the evil Queen. Ico must negotiate the puzzles of the ruined castle and escort the Princess to safety. She, as well as Ico, cannot climb or jump, so Ico has to clear or create a path where there is none. Yorda is the only one capable of opening the many magical doors necessary to escape. Ico needs her as much as she needs him, so he must protect her from the many evil spirits that will try to take her away.&amp;#xA;Shown through a third-person perspective, mixing action-based exploration gameplay with puzzles, the game has no HUD. Other striking features are the soft lightning visual style, later adapted by many other games, low-key use of in-game music, and conversations through a fictional language, leaving much to the player&apos;s imagination.

  <plot>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender&apos;s nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.&amp;#xA;The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender&apos;s Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room&apos;s computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.&amp;#xA;The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot&apos;s personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a &quot;mixed&quot; mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.</plot>

  <plot>Story-wise, Jak &amp; Daxter: The Lost Frontier picks up after the events of Jak X: Combat Racing. Jak, Daxter and Kiera travel to the Brink -- the edge of the known world -- to investigate the recent Eco shortage, and end up caught up in a struggle between the region&apos;s inhabitants and a group of Sky Pirates.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is a return to the series&apos; 3D platforming roots -- a balance of jumping/traversal challenges, weapon-based and melee combat. There are also several aerial combat segments (both objective-based and free-form dogfighting), as well as brawler-like stages where the player controls the giant, Hulk-like &quot;Dark Daxter&quot;. As usual, the player can unlock and customize Jak&apos;s Eco powers and vehicles along the way.</plot>

There Daxter accidentally falls into a pool of evil Dark Eco, and transforms into a weasel-like creature.

If a dino should escape, you have the option of entering the helicopter in a first person view to try to shoot the dino with a tranquilizer dart. If you want to stick to building only, you can let the AI capture the dino.&amp;#xA;In order to breed a dinosaur, you must hire a team to locate fossils, then you must have the fossils analyzed. The whole process takes a while, but the longer you let your teams work, the longer your dino will live, and the happier your visitors will be. Force the team to give you the results early, and your dino might only live for ten days.&amp;#xA;The different dino&apos;s require different resources. Herbivores require lots of trees and grass, while carnivores require goats and cows. Your carnivores may get tired of being fed, so you might have to send in a smaller sized dino (a raptor in a T-Rex pen, for example), for the larger dino to hunt.&amp;#xA;The game includes multiple camera angles. You can rotate 360 degrees, zoom in and out, enter &quot;visitor&quot; cam, ride on the safari, take a scenic tour in a hot air balloon, or look out the helicopter.&amp;#xA;Also included is a comphrensive guide to dinosaurs, geared to help you figure out what each dino likes and dislikes, and how to make them happy, as well as a brief history of each specific dino.</plot>

  <plot>You are Rico Rodriguez, a CIA-agent who is sent to the small Island of San Esperito to start a revolution and bring down the current regime under the rule of General Salvador Mendoza.&amp;#xA;After you jumped out of the airplane and helped your local contact survive an attack by gang members, you have - much like GTA: San Andreas - the freedom to do what you want. The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces.&amp;#xA;As a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset.&amp;#xA;But of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns. Rico is also trained to drive everything that has an engine, from a normal bike to a fully-armed military helicopter.</plot>

At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.&amp;#xA;Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari&apos;s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.&amp;#xA;The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</plot>

  <plot>Using cel-shaded visuals and the Renderware engine, Killer7 depicts a peaceful alternate world where crime and nuclear weapons have vanished. In a strange turn of events, an underground kingpin unleashes a wave of violence with a invisible suicide army called Heaven&apos;s Smile. The unlikely hero to face this threat is the crippled 65 year-old wheelchair-bound Harman Smith.&amp;#xA;Smith is schizophrenic and you assume one of his seven different personalities throughout the game. Each character has unique abilities. Dan, for example, is a true marksman, while Coyote is an experienced thief with exceptional movement. The unusual cast also includes the blind Con who moves very fast, Kaede with ranged skills, Mask who has the deadliest arsenal and the albino Kevin who can turn invisible. Garcian is the leader of the pack and the only one who can communicate with Harman and revive the bodies of slain personalities. During the game, you can change characters at any time and any place.&amp;#xA;Depending of the persona you play with, Killer7 mixes stealth and adventure with pure action. It carries a surreal atmosphere with eclectic music, but a politically charged and thought-provoking story with some goofy humour as well.</plot>

  <plot>The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, The King of Fighters 2000 expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters &apos;99. This year&apos;s tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K&apos; and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.&amp;#xA;The King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year&apos;s tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the &quot;alternate&quot; striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami&apos;s alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden &quot;maniac&quot; striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.</plot>

  <plot>In this eighth installment of the King of Fighters series, ten different teams once again battle it out in several countries to decide which team will be this year&apos;s King of Fighters. However, the NESTS organization is once again standing in the participant&apos;s way; they have deployed their own team of four fighters, lead by two individuals of high-rank within NESTS: a man claiming to be the original Zero and Igniz, the CEO of NESTS.&amp;#xA;The character roster has been updated yet again for this release in the series. Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.</plot>

  <plot>The tenth installment in SNK&apos;s long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game&apos;s storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...&amp;#xA;This year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF &apos;02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).&amp;#xA;Like The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF &apos;94 to KOF &apos;98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.</plot>

  <plot>The eleventh installment in SNK Playmore&apos;s long-running King of Fighters series and the ninth event in the official storyline, The King of Fighters XI is the first game in the series to forego the traditional numbering convention used by the series, and the first game in the series to move beyond the hardware capabilities of the Neo-Geo system. After the controversial resurgence of the Orochi power in the 2003 King of Fighters tournament, the tournament and the fighters return after a two year break in the action. Some are motivated to investigate the new Orochi situation and the antagonistic fighter Ash Crimson, while others enter the tourney to settle old scores...&amp;#xA;The King of Fighters XI features a roster of 33 &quot;team&quot; characters, 7 PS2 exclusive characters, 5 mid-boss characters and 2 boss characters. In total, this allows a player to choose between +40 characters. Many of the characters are returning fighters from the other games in the KOF series, though notable new faces exist in the effective forms of Oswald, Duck King, Bonne Jenet, Elisabeth Blanctorche and Gai Tendo.&amp;#xA;The &quot;tag system&quot; used in The King of Fighters 2003 is still employed in KOF XI. However, the change in the arcade hardware has brought about many gameplay changes since the 2003 release. A new power stock system - specifically called &quot;Skill Stocks&quot; - has been added for use with a few extra special maneuvers called &quot;Shifts&quot;. A character can use a &quot;Quick Shift&quot; to tag in another fighter while in the middle of a combo, while that character may also use a &quot;Saving Shift&quot; to tag out if they are on the verge of defeat. Another maneuver, called the &quot;Dream Cancel&quot;, has also been added to the system. Dream Cancels can be used to interrupt a special move with another one, even allowing a fighter to interrupt a Desperation Move to initiate a Leader Desperation Move. The &quot;Time Out&quot; system has be revamped as well - the system now takes into account the number of fighters defeated on a team and the number and power of attacks made by a team to reach its verdict.</plot>

  <plot>This is the third game in the King&apos;s Field series released outside of Japan (fourth in Japan). The story begins when the hero gets a visit from a mysterious stranger. The stranger gives the hero an idol and then vanishes. At once the hero recognizes the idol as the &quot;Idol of Sorrow&quot; and goes to the land of despair to learn more about it. Shortly before the hero arrives in this land though, a small force led by the prince attempted to reclaim the land again, but most of the men have disappeared. Seek out the forest folk, as legend says they were the creators of the idol and will hopefully know how to remove the curse that is on it.&amp;#xA;King&apos;s Field is a first-person role-playing game that utilizes both melee and ranged weapons, as well as different magic spells. During gameplay expect to run into many monsters, puzzles, NPCs, and traps. You&apos;ll use the items you collect throughout the game in various places later on. A new and different keystone system is used in this iteration of the series where you can only teleport to designated key stones when near a teleportation circle. Search the runes and discover the story behind the idol.</plot>

  <plot>Sora&apos;s world is shattered when a violent storm hits his home, and he is separated from his two closest friends. The storm scatters the three to unknown worlds. At the same time, there is turmoil in the Disney Castle. King Mickey is missing, and Court Wizard Donald and Captain Goofy are out to find him. On their travels they meet Sora, on his own search for his lost friends. The three are told of ominous creatures called Heartless, being without hearts derived from an unknown dimension and are the ones responsible for the devastating storm.&amp;#xA;The Disney villains, enticed by the power of darkness, manipulate the Darkness to help them gather the princesses of heart, who are needed to open a mysterious final door. Upon discovering the link between the Heartless, the storm, and the disappearance of King Mickey, Sora, Donald, and Goofy join forces and help familiar Disney heroes to save their worlds from the Heartless.&amp;#xA;In Kingdom Hearts players step into the very large shoes of Sora, wielder of the keyblade. Sora can attack with the blade, and as he levels up he will gain more attacks that are automatically chained together. Sora can learn magic and put healing items into a quick menu, and both can only be used in real time. Donald and Goofy (as well as an additional character exclusive to each world/disney movie) will follow Sora. Their equipment and AI can be adjusted, but they can not be directly controlled. Defeated enemies will drop many kinds of items including synthesis materials. Sora can take these to the Synthesis shop in Twilight Town to turn them into usable items, accessories, and weapons.&amp;#xA;Traveling between each world requires Sora&apos;s party to fly through space in a Gummi Ship. The Gummi Ship can be completely customized, from speed and armor to weapons and shape, out of parts picked up from destroyed Gummi Ships, found in worlds, or bought from a store. Larger, more complex ships can be built as the game progresses, and plans can be found from destroyed enemies or from an NPC that will automatically build a Gummi Ship of specific specifications.</plot>

  <plot>Sora, Donald, and Goofy are back in the third installment (second for PS2) of the Kingdom Hearts series, continuing where Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories left off. The trio awakens from their sleep and goes to Twilight Town. When the game begins, you will first have control over a boy name Roxas who wields a dual-Keyblade. He is trying to enjoy the remainder of his summer vacation with his friends but he keeps having flash-backs of someone else&apos;s memories.&amp;#xA;When he meets up with Sora, the two learns they have a special connection with one another. Afterwards, the group will continue their search for King Mickey and Riku. This time, they will travel to new worlds and work with various characters from the Disney and Final Fantasy universes. This includes worlds from not only Disney&apos;s animated movies but other movies as well like Pirates of the Caribbean and TRON.&amp;#xA;In Kingdom Hearts II, Sora and his friends will battle various enemies including the Heartless from Kingdom Hearts, but also a group of enemies called Nobodies. Nobodies are &quot;nonexistent beings&quot; who are under the control of Organization XIII - a group of 13 members in black coats that Sora and his friends have reduced down to just half.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is very similar to Kingdom Hearts: the player controls Sora with Donald and Goofy helping with their magic and attacks. Sora can use various magic powers as well as use Summon which will call upon the aid of special Disney characters that will temporarily fight alongside him. A new feature of combat are &quot;Reaction Commands&quot;. Some enemies will leave themselves open during attacks, and if the player presses the Reaction Command button when prompted Sora will take advantage of the situation, either turning an enemy&apos;s attack against them, striking from a defenseless side for extra damage, or avoiding an otherwise unavoidable attack. As the trio levels up and progresses in the game they will gain new abilities that they can equip. Also, after Mickey meets the party, if Sora is KO&apos;d the player will have the option of controlling Mickey and defending Sora until he can recover.&amp;#xA;Another new feature is the Drive gauge. When filled and activated Sora absorbs the strength of his allies and gains new powers, like long range magical bullets in Magician form or the ability to use two keyblades in Strength form. Using Drive forms will power them up, unlocking new abilities and allowing them to be used for longer periods of time.&amp;#xA;The Gummi Ship returns, but the speed of combat during Gummi Ship level has been greatly increased. While the path of the Gummi Ship is still out of the player&apos;s control, the ship can now attack enemies to the front, sides, and behind. Gummi Ship levels can be re-challenged at different difficulty levels, with different levels offering greater challenge and new enemy patterns. Achieving high scores in these levels rewards new Gummi Ship parts and plans.</plot>

By ringing the four bells across the land, Klonoa can restore harmony, but the Sky Pirate Leorina is in hot pursuit, after Klonoa&apos;s magic ring...&amp;#xA;Klonoa 2: Lunatea&apos;s Veil is a 3D side-scrolling platformer. The main goal of the game is to get to the end of each level (or &apos;Vision&apos;), but there are also special goals to achieve. Firstly, each Vision contains six Momett Dolls hidden in each level. Secondly, there are Dream Stones scattered throughout each level - green ones are worth one, while blue ones are worth five. Certain puzzles also contain tricky use of the &quot;Dream Spirit&quot;, which doubles the value of all collected Dream Stones. New to Klonoa 2 are hoverboard sections, which play at a faster, more action-oriented pace.&amp;#xA;But what makes Klonoa unique is his abilities. Klonoa can shoot a &apos;wind bullet&apos; into foes, which puffs them up and allows Klonoa to carry them. Klonoa can then launch them straight at foes, or jump with them, giving him an extra boost. If he needs extra length to his jump, holding the jump button will allow him to hover for a little longer, too. Different enemies have different effects - for example, certain foes have propellers on their heads and will rocket you into the sky, while others will act like time bombs and explode after a short while.</plot>

On their way home however, they notice unusual black marks in demolished villages, and decide to investigate.&amp;#xA;All missions have the player control KITT, who has now been equipped with three weapons: a lock-on laser, a plasma gun, and missiles. There is also turbo boost to jump over obstacles, micro jam to scan items and recharge, the ski mode to drive on two wheels through narrow passages, super pursuit mode for faster speed, and a shield to block incoming attacks. When damaged or running low on energy, certain functions are disabled.&amp;#xA;The different missions are linked by sequences where the story is further explained using the in-game engine. Many familiar characters from the tv series make an appearance, such as Bonnie, Devon, Garth and KARR. Missions either focus on racing or exploration. In the first type, the player mainly evades attacks while racing on a highway. The latter has the player drive inside closed areas, maneuvering through passages and fighting robots. There are also a few puzzle elements where the player has to locate terminals, shoot an object in the environment, or find enemies&apos; weaknesses. When a stunt is performed, the action slows down and the camera switches to a spectacular angle.&amp;#xA;Next to the main story mode, the individual missions can be replayed in the mission mode.

  <plot>In Knights of the Temple II, you again play the role of a Templar knight: Paul de Raque, the grandmaster of the Order of the Temple. The game is set in medieval 13th century Europe and the Middle East. The story revolves around the new crusade of our hero to recover 3 ancient pagan artifacts essential to prevent the imminent attack of the demon armies into our realm of existence.&amp;#xA;It is a 3D 3rd-person action game with RPG elements. Gameplay consists of completing quests through travelling in the various locations in the game or battling your way through enemy men and monsters.&amp;#xA;The storyline for one is non-linear. At the start of the game you can choose 1 out of 3 locations to visit. Advancing in the game will unlock new locations. Each location is either a city or town where you can advance in the primary mission, obtain sub-quests, trade, meet people, etc. or it could be a dungeon type location crawling with monsters. Often its a little combination of both.&amp;#xA;Most of the gameplay (when not exploring cities) revolve around combat and character development. Combat consists of 3D 3rd Person Perspective point of view where you can attack enemies using various skills, abilities and attack combo&apos;s. Each of which can be upgraded at any point of the game by spending experience points to the pointed skill, ability or combo.&amp;#xA;On character development, there are 3 major areas that may be upgraded: (1) Knightly Abilities; Spiritually oriented gifts of the Templar knight: from healing to other holy abilities. (2) Skill Abilities; These are usually attack-based skills. Various attacking styles to soften and defeat both men and monster. (3) Combo&apos;s. The extension of the &quot;attack button&quot;. Upgrading the combo section provides additional attack moves.&amp;#xA;Combat also is uniquely divided into 3 different weapons. The first is the standard Sword and Shield, providing high defense and standard attack, useful in defensive stances and vs. ranged enemies; The second is the 2-handed weapon, primary for direct damage in close-combat against single or multiple enemies; The third is ranged combat using a crossbow. The perspective in ranged combat diverts to 1st person perspective (though you can still see your head).&amp;#xA;During the course of the game, you can obtain additional weapons and armor (as well as other items), either from the course of a sub-quest or purchasing it from a local trader.</plot>

Once the player completes Utsuki&apos;s and Sakuya&apos;s scenarios, he unlocks the third scenario where he experiences the story from the point of view of Doman himself.&amp;#xA;This is a mixture of third-person action and puzzle-solving adventure. As in all survival horror games, your means of defense are limited and scarce. Unlike most games of the kind, physical attacks with weapons are not your only way to defend yourself against hordes of undead creatures.

This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you&apos;ll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you&apos;ll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas.&amp;#xA;You&apos;ll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge).&amp;#xA;As you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!</plot>

Of course, Lupin is having none of that, and tries to rescue Fujiko himself, but winds up cursed by an ancient black art, which will kill him in three days.

  <plot>While games of the Pro Cycling Manager series attempt to recreate the feeling of being a Pro/Continental Tour cycling team manager, Tour de France: Centenary Edition is all about providing the thrills of being a cyclist, starting from the end of the peloton and making way to get a chance at victory. The game is licensed by the Tour de France, and features many real teams and cyclists in six stages, some of which available in reverse mode. Due to the nature of the name, this changes drastically the nature of the tracks - what can be a perfect track for climbers becomes one for the technical riders (with good breaking and turning abilities) in reverse. While the game provides a much simplified arcade experience, it plays a lot differently from games featuring motor vehicles. The player has a limited stamina bar, which decreases as the player goes faster to break away from the current group or pedals harder to beat a steeper hill. In order to replenish it, he can drink a limited number of water-bottles, use down slope sections or, the key to a successful stage, use opponents&apos; and team-mates slipstreams. However, this is not all without risks - down slope sections can be tricky due to the enormous speeds, and colliding takes stamina as well as time (and eventually, might force a retirement), and slipstreams are not always available or big enough. As cycling is also a team sport, the player can request a team-mate to slipstream him during a break, or to give him additional water bottles. They are also easier to slipstream, as they won&apos;t break away if the player close too long. Also playing a huge part on the race is the weather - rain makes pedalling much harder and increase the breaking distance noticeably, while fog reduces stamina loss, but players must be careful not to overdo speed due to limited viewing distance. Game modes include training, arcade, time trials and the Tour de France, a career mode where the player can start a 5-year plan to become the world&apos;s number one cyclist by winning local races, which allows to afford better bike parts and training sessions. Parts affect mostly how well the player controls the bike, but as the game simulates the stage until the final miles, the starting position in the peloton is defined by the training, so a player who has a top bike but neglected training will struggle to perform well in the Tour de France, as instead of starting in the top 40 will start in 80th or even worse, losing precious time and both sprint and mountain points in the process.</plot>

  <plot>Tour de France is an arcade racing game based on the premier road cycling event in the world. The game features 5 different game modes: Arcade. where the player competes freely on any of available tracks, Tour de France, where the player aims to win the prestigious competition in five years, by training and winning enough money to afford better bike parts and training sessions, Time Trial (racing against the clock) and train basic skills. As the player is controlling a bike, it isn&apos;t just a matter of pressing down the throttle button and avoid other competitors while keeping the best possible trajectory. While the last two are still as important, the player must pace according to the stamina of the racer. While it can be partially replenished using water bottles, to win races the player must use downward slopes to gain velocity while still recovering stamina as well as taking advantage of the slipstream of other riders. While losing all stamina won&apos;t immediately abort the race, the rider will stop and put a feet down until it recovers to an acceptable level, making any chance of a good result impossible. The race will stop, however, once the damage (sustained by hitting other riders of fences at high speeds) is greater than half of the stamina bar.

  <plot>Following the events of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2, Raziel and Kain were trapped in the Serafan fortress. Separated by sudden events, Raziel was forced to retreat into the spectral realm, leaving Kain to escape from the Serafan on his own. Both must escape the predicament they find themselves in and fight back against those who would seek to use them as manipulations in a grander plot. From both heroes cry out shouts of defiance, and a thirst to find the revelations that have been buried in the world of Nosgoth.&amp;#xA;Legacy of Kain: Defiance is a 3rd person action-adventure game, combining concepts seen in both Blood Omen 2 and Soul Reaver 2. The story unfolds through chapters, focusing alternately on Kain and Raziel as they pursue their separate, though intertwined quests. Control of each character alternates between levels, however both are controlled from a behind-the-shoulder perspective. While both heroes are different, they are similar in movement, ability to attack, defend, jump and access special abilities. Kain and Raziel no longer pick up weapons, instead both using a form of the Soul Reaver weapon (Kain uses the physical sword form, Raziel uses an energy blade). Each Soul Reaver can now be &quot;charged&quot; to unleash a special ability, determined by the current alignment of Soul Reaver at the time. Both Kain and Raziel lose energy at a constant rate and must feed to replenish life energy (Kain feeds on the blood of living creatures, Raziel feeds on the souls of living and non-living creatures). And both Kain and Raziel feature telekinetic abilities to manipulate objects at a distance.&amp;#xA;Kain and Raziel are different characters however, that play differently, each requiring use of his talents,to bypass obstacles (sometimes the same obstacle). Kain focuses on strong combat and destructive abilities. He is able able to power up the Soul Reaver weapon using properties of the Pillars of Nosgoth. Raziel is more subtle, able to use stealth and the phasing between material and spectral worlds in order to discover new paths. As in Soul Reaver, Raziel can phase into the spectral world at any time but must find a special location in order to phase back. Raziel powers up the Soul Reaver using elemental powers.</plot>

  <plot>Dawn of the Dragon is the third and final chapter of the Legend of Spyro trilogy. It starts when Spyro and Cynder are freed from their crystalline prison. They are former foes, but the Dark Master binds them through green energy chains. After escaping their prison with Sparx and Hunter, they are shown what the Dark Master has done after he escaped from the Well of Souls during the Night of Eternal Darkness. They travel through Dragon City, the Burned Lands and the Floating Islands to confront Malefor at his lair. Just like the previous game, Dawn of the Dragon is a third-person action game with a focus on fighting and exploration even though progress is entirely linear. New to the series is the ability to fly at any time. This edition also provides a cooperative mode with Spyro and Cynder and with just a single player it is possible to switch between them at any time. Spyro attacks with fire, electricity, earth and ice, while Cynder controls poison, fear, wind and shadow. Collected gems provide power-ups and both characters can also equip pieces of dragon armour. Gems include blue ones to upgrade moves, red ones restore health, and green ones make available element attacks through dragon magic. The amount of blue ones provided is based on a melee combo system. Fury gems have been removed. They are replaced with dark crystals that need to be destroyed as they drain magic. Fury is now determined through a meter that fills up during attacks. Next to the regular enemies there are now elite enemies that were a mask with a certain colour. A specific attack is needed to get rid off the mask and then regular attacks become effective.</plot>

  <plot>Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth.&amp;#xA;It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.&amp;#xA;Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.&amp;#xA;In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.&amp;#xA;Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op.

  <plot>In LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures the players get to explore the Indiana Jones universe with &quot;LEGO-fied&quot; characters.&amp;#xA;The game focuses on the three original films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, each film consisting of six separate chapters retelling the stories in a humorous, light-hearted way that tones down the violence while removing some of the more overt religious and political references found in the film.&amp;#xA;All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGOs, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart.&amp;#xA;In this third-person platform/action game, players take control over various heroes including Indiana Jones, Marion Ravenwood or Dr. Marcus Brody, and also allows players to play the villains such as Belloq and Mola Ram.&amp;#xA;Each character has different abilities and weapons. While Indiana Jones has a whip with which he can pull items out of reach, the female characters can jump higher, scholars can decipher hieroglyphics, mechanics can fix machines and diggers can unearth buried treasure. The characters also have different phobias (snakes, rats, spiders), each corresponding to their personalities.&amp;#xA;The main campaign of the game is called Story Mode in which the player follows the film&apos;s stories with two pre-defined characters and cut-scenes. Once the level has been cleared, however, the player can return in Free Play mode and switch between all the characters that have been unlocked, allowing access to previously unreachable areas to collect all other artifacts and bonus items.&amp;#xA;Destroying or building objects produces Lego studs, which allows the player to buy additional characters and cheat modes in Barnett College (the main hub). Players can also watch previous cut-scenes, examine previously found treasures, enter codes, or explore the college at their leisure.&amp;#xA;As in the LEGO Star Wars series, in addition to the single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode. The second player can enter the game at any given time by pressing a button on the second controller.</plot>

LEGO Star Wars II is a game where players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO&apos;s, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart. LEGO Star Wars puts an original spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue.&amp;#xA;In this third-person platforming/action game, players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars. In Story Mode, players reenact the original movies with LEGOs. Each character has different weapons, like light-sabers for Jedi&apos;s, and crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers. Each character also has different abilities, like Jedi&apos;s being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jet pack. It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve puzzles and traverse the levels of the game. In addition to a single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode.&amp;#xA;In addition, there is also a Free-play mode that allows you to go back and play your beaten levels. For one, this allows you to go back and play the level with any character in the game that you have unlocked. However, a newly added feature allows you to create your own mixed up LEGO characters, and also allows you to create your own vehicles out of LEGO&apos;s.

You explore the entire Space Station Hotel, from the kitchen to maintenance to bedrooms to bathrooms, finding items and encountering a slew of different enemies.

  <plot>This is a collection of mini-games based on the UK comedy sketch TV series Little Britain that ran between 2003 and 2006. The included games are based on some of the scenes and recurring characters. It also includes the original voices of the two leads and the narrator. Players need to unlock the different games by competing in a Tour with three difficulty levels. On Easy, for each 50,000 points another game is opened up and clips from the series are unlocked. The included games are set at different, fictitious locations in Britain and require a lot of button mashing:&amp;#xA;1. Darkley Noone: Vicky Pollars needs to complete two laps on roller-skates in a skate park. She has to collect CDs to throw a party, while avoiding hazard, performing tricks when jumping in the air, and grinding on rails.&amp;#xA;2. Herby: Lou and Andy go to the swimming pool, but as soon as they are there, Andy doesn&apos;t like it. While Lou explains to a guard how he wants his handicapped friend get to swim, Andy need to dive off diving boards and perform tricks. There are three boards to choose from and he needs to get back in his wheelchair before time runs out.&amp;#xA;3. Sessex: Weight Watcher guide Marjorie runs around in a supermarket collecting cookies in a Pac-Man-style mini-game. The ghosts are represented by fatties she needs to avoid, but by picking up cake (similar to the original power pellets), she can take them out for a short time.&amp;#xA;4. Slut: Letty has to squash all the frogs in her living room, making sure not to hit any other objects. Gameplay is similar to the Whac-A-Mole concept, except that the frogs jump around instead of popping up.&amp;#xA;5. Old Haven: Emily, a real lady, needs to score a number of goals in a game of football (soccer) before time runs out. She needs to progress over the pitch step by step and avoid hitting the defenders as that returns her to the starting location. She does get points for shooting them in their private parts. The PSP version is slightly different as it is presented as a game of penalty kicks, without defenders. The direction and the force of the kick can be determined separately.&amp;#xA;6. Pox: make matches of three identical items collecting food in Maggie&apos;s gullet as she gulps it down. Once it is full, she can spew out all the food over her friends at the party for extra points.&amp;#xA;7. Llandewi Breffi: Dafydd Thomas is the only gay in the village and needs to prove it. He rides a bicycle through the streets and needs to collect copies of Gay Magazine while running down other people and slapping fake gays.&amp;#xA;The PSP version contains an additional game:&amp;#xA;1. Flatley: help &quot;Eh Eh Eh&quot; Anne at the psychiatric institute to destroy the flowers in the garden. She can stamp them, pull them out, and then smash it or chuck it. She needs to avoid the men in white coats that chase after her. She can temporarily stun them by flashing them when she lifts her skirt.&amp;#xA;Next to the games in the Tour, there are also Challenges where a mini-game needs to be replayed with a specific goal, a movie gallery where the unlocked clips can be viewed, and a highscore list. Aside from graphical differences, gameplay is largely identical across the platforms. The PSP version includes wireless multiplayer for up to two players.</plot>

  <plot>The handheld and PlayStation 2 version of Aragorn&apos;s Quest follows the same story as the eponymous console version: the story of Aragorn during the War of the Ring is narrated by Frodo&apos;s friend, Samwise Gamgee, who recalls the story to entertain his children who want to know about the adventures of the one known as Strider. In this version, however, the hobbits are only seen in cutscenes, and has no gameplay in the Shire, that serves as the game hub in the PlayStation 3 and Wii version of the game. In game, the player takes control of Aragorn who fights orcs, trolls and other enemies using both his sword and his bow. Aragorn can block, use quick or strong sword attacks and shoot arrows and charge his bow for more powerful attacks. He can also use a variety of special moves, many of which are acquired as the game progresses. Defeating foes replenishes some health, and gives experience points and morale. Aragorn&apos;s morale is depleted by using some special moves. As in most RPGs, gaining experience results in leveling-up, which improve Aragorn&apos;s stats and rewards the player with points to use to learn previously acquired special moves. Pieces of equipment such as swords and belts can be equipped to increase Aragorn&apos;s prowesses.</plot>

  <plot>Electronic Arts&apos; first game based on the Lord of the Rings movies is an action game with classic beat&apos;em up-style gameplay. Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy.&amp;#xA;Players, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth.&amp;#xA;The player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves.&amp;#xA;Several levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat.&amp;#xA;Most combat scenes from the movies have been turned into levels for the game: from the confrontation with the Ringwraiths at the Weathertop and the battle in the Mines of Moria from the first film to fights with Warg-riders and other enemies on the plains of Rohan from the second film. The game culminates in the defense of Helm&apos;s Deep, even though the depiction of the battle in the game differs considerably from that in the film.&amp;#xA;Between the levels, cutscenes tell the story. These scenes combine actual film footage with footage rendered with the game engine.&amp;#xA;The game offers lots of bonus content, some of which must be unlocked by completing missions or reaching certain levels with the characters.

While driving a car, you can perform drive-by&apos;s by sticking your hand out the window and firing.&amp;#xA;To add to the realism, if your gas tank gets punctured, gas will slowly leak out until your car totally empties. Luckily, there are gas stations scattered throughout the city, allowing you to refuel.&amp;#xA;Trying to impede you is the police force. They will act on anything suspicious. If they see you carrying a weapon, they will attempt to arrest you. Going over the speed limit, running red lights, crashing into buildings/cars/objects/etc. will result in fines.</plot>

  <plot>Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player&apos;s club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.&amp;#xA;Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball&apos;s direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball.&amp;#xA;Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.&amp;#xA;The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.</plot>

The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its rightful owner.&amp;#xA;The game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it&apos;s the enemy&apos;s turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.</plot>

A mysterious voice tells you to stick in the nearby earpiece, and explains that the &quot;lethal&quot; injection was just a heavy sedative. The man, later identified as Starkweather, turns out to be a director of snuff movies, where the people are really killed. He explains that if you follow his directions, manage to kill people and survive, you&apos;ll earn your freedom. This begins James Earl Cash&apos;s journey.&amp;#xA;Throughout the course of the game, you&apos;ll have to make your way through different locales, such as a city and a mall, while killing gangs. You&apos;ll face lots of different gangs, from The Hoods and The Skins to tougher gangs like The Innocenz. Gang members carry weapons ranging from pistols and shotguns to knives and glass shards.&amp;#xA;Manhunt is primarily a stealth game. You&apos;ll have to hide behind walls, flatten yourself against walls, crouch, hide behind objects, and walk to avoid attracting attention. You can also throw glass bottles to create a distraction, or you can punch surfaces and yell to get gangs to come to you.&amp;#xA;You have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from the traditional, such as the shotgun and uzi, to the disgusting, such as a sickle and plastic bag. Each weapon has three different ways of attacking, depending on how long you hold the button. A quick attack will do the job, a medium attack will be bloody, but a high attack, requiring the longest amount of time, will earn you the most points, and will allow you to see your kill in a cinematic style, with blood splatting on the camera, and gurgling noises.&amp;#xA;Manhunt also lets you use a USB headset, such as the one that came included with SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals. With the headset, you will hear Starkweather speak into your ears instead of through your speakers, and you will be able to shout into the microphone to attract gangs instead of pressing a button.</plot>

  <plot>Manhunt 2 does not build upon the story and events of the first game. Instead, the same game mechanics are transferred to a new location, the Dixmor Insane Asylum, where the staff prefers to beat up the patients and experiment on them, rather than to offer treatment for their illness. One day a power outage allows the patients to revolt and bring mayhem to the asylum. The player gets the chance to play two roles: as Dr. Daniel Lamb and Leo Kasper. Although the beginning is set inside the asylum, the action soon moves to other locations.&amp;#xA;The game mechanics are largely stealth oriented, while later levels offer more of a regular third-person shooter feel when more firearms become available. Gunplay requires extensive use of cover, maneuvers and sometimes stealth for success. There is a radar system, enemies have different levels of awareness and kills are best performed from the shadows. Players can throw objects to distract enemies or make noises into the USB headset to lure them away from their friends (PS2). To hide in the dark a quick mini-game needs to be performed. If it is not completed in time, the character&apos;s location will be revealed at once.&amp;#xA;As in the first game players can perform executions, with three styles: Hasty (white), Violent (yellow) and Gruesome (red). These feature explicit violence including strangling, beatings, gun violence, setting them on fire and more. Some of these kills are however censored with blacked out scenes or the camera turning away. In the Wii version player need to mimic the motions needed for a kill with the combination of the Wiimote and the Nunchuk.&amp;#xA;All versions are quite similar. The Wii edition includes three exclusive weapons (bottle, mace and a razor), while the other two versions have a weapon not found in the Wii game: a samurai sword. The Wii version is also the only one to include a short tutorial to familiarize the player with the controls. Other small changes in the Wii edition include more detailed environments, additional dialogue, new hunters (Sexual Deviants scene), some changes in weapon placement, a new manhole execution (in Ghosts), and more animations for Daniel and Leo, especially in close combat.</plot>

  <plot>Contents Under Pressure is an action adventure that combines stealth and combat, as you guide urban graffiti artist Trane to fame. In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city.&amp;#xA;The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.&amp;#xA;The title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the &quot;Get In, Get Up, and Get Out&quot; principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds.&amp;#xA;The game is conceived by clothing impresario Marc Ecko, founder of the suburban designer label Ecko and is intended to pay tribute to graffiti culture and its history. Artists such as Cope2, Futura and Seen contributed art to the game.</plot>

Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers.

  <plot>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.&amp;#xA;You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.&amp;#xA;Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.&amp;#xA;The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:&amp;#xA;There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.</plot>

If two players land on the same space, there is a head-to-head competition to determine who can stay. At the end of each round, there is a four-player minigame. These minigames can involve racing racing, windsurfing, kayaking, assembling a car from pieces to match a picture, tag, reflexes or any number of other things. Coins to purchase helpful items are awarded based on performance in these games.&amp;#xA;There is also a Bring It On mode where victory is determined by winning a set number of minigames.

  <plot>Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).&amp;#xA;The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn&apos;t really like you.&amp;#xA;To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there&apos;s everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can&apos;t use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.&amp;#xA;But the real heart of Mashed is the split-screen multiplayer mode which you can play with up to four players on one PC. If you don&apos;t find four friends you can fill in the missing spots with bots or just leave them open. The additional eighth, multiplayer exclusive game mode is like CTF with cars. The goal is to hold the flag and drive as far away from the enemies as possible to get a point. To keep the race interesting for the players that are already out of it, they can use a helicopter which flies over the track to launch missile attacks on the cars still racing. So you can take your revenge before the race is even over and the racers have one more thing to worry about. But this feature can be deactivated when you setup the race.</plot>

Instead of just running around and shoot like Lara Croft, Max has a trick called Bullet-Time (tm).

  <plot>Mega Man X teams up with Zero in a traditional console RPG. The game was developed by the same people who did Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter. Unlike most RPGs the storyline is very similar to the traditional side-scrolling Mega Man games. In addition, the game is shorter than most RPGs. The basic plot of the game is to save Giga City from the rioting of the Liberion Army. As the game progresses you have around 7 members. With a metal called Force Metal, your characters can upgrade various elements. The Gamecube version let&apos;s you link up to Game Boy Advance so you can use the GBA as a treasure hunter locater.

  <plot>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames is the sequel to Mercenaries. Rather than a port, compared to the next-gen versions this title was reworked to a large extent by Pi Studios with fundamental differences in approach. It is set in the country of Venezuela, with a new set of enemies and allies. The game begins with the player choosing one of three mercenaries from the original game, (Mattias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs and Jennifer Mui), and is contracted by a Venezuelan billionaire, Ramon Solano, to rescue a general named Carlos Carmona who attempted a coup d&apos;état and failed. Once the player succeeds, Solano and Carmona refuse to pay and try to kill the mercenary.&amp;#xA;Afterwards, Carmona and Solano take over Venezuela, pulling of a successful coup, seizing the countries oil platforms, putting the world on alert as they seize total control of the country. Unbeknown to them, the players mercenary has survived and is now plotting revenge on the pair. The player must take contracts from rival factions such as Universal Petroleum, an oil company who&apos;s business is threatened by Solano, the P.L.A.V. (People&apos;s Liberation Army of Venezuela), who are a force of rebel soldiers determined to take back their country, The Jamaican Pirates, who profit from Solano&apos;s forces, The A.N. (Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region and The Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is basically the same as the previous version, with the control scheme virtually the same, but there are some tweaks as well. One of which is a new way to hijack a vehicle. Whereas in the previous game the player could simply walk up to the vehicle and automatically hijack, now they must kill the gunner of the vehicle and then enter a &quot;mini-game&quot;, pressing a certain button or rotating the analog stick in a certain way to successfully hijack the vehicle. Likewise, players can also you a grappling hook to latch on to passing helicopters to make it easier to hijack. Players can now swim, whereas the previous game the player would die the instant they hit the water.&amp;#xA;Players now have a &quot;headquarters&quot; of sort, where the player can stockpile weapons, supply crates and vehicles. To obtain these stockpiles the player must recruit three certain soldiers unlockable in the game. A helicopter pilot named Ewan Garrett, who delivers stockpile crates as well as medivacs the player, a mechanic named Eva Navarro, who will repair and stock vehicles when you return them to the villa and is used for artillery strikes and a fighter pilot named Misha Milanich, who is used for air strikes. Players can use these during a mission by calling in Ewan to deliver their supplies via helicopter during a mission. Also Fiona Taylor reprises her role, giving the player technical information during the missions.&amp;#xA;There is no more black market contacts to purchase supplies or airstrikes, instead players must take complete jobs for contacts scattered on the island, completing jobs for these contacts will supply the player&apos;s headquarters with materials such as weapons, medikits, and artillery support. Players can also stockpile vehicles by driving back to their headquarters, keeping them at the garage for use in missions. Also, players must have gas as well now to bring in supplies or call in airstrikes, which can be obtained by either completing contracts or collecting them scattered throughout the country.</plot>

  <plot>Mercury Meltdown is the sequel to Archer Maclean&apos;s Mercury, a puzzle game where your job is to guide a blob of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world, while hazard try to zap, attract, repulse, eat, or blow you up.&amp;#xA;Mercury Meltdown features a new vibrant visual style, a lot of completely new stages, a free-look camera, ghost mercuries and replays for your best times that can be saved, and much more. The game&apos;s original realistic graphics have been turned into a more cartoon style. The mercury now has a black line around the outside of it.&amp;#xA;The main change in the game is the ability to change the mercury into 3 more states. Besides normal state now you can turn the mercury into the &quot;Fast&quot; or &quot;Slow&quot; using a heater and a cooler, and using a solidifier you can make it unto &quot;Solid&quot; state, a round, non-breakable ball. The mercury can still be split using a splitter, needed to solve certain puzzles.&amp;#xA;Unlike the original Mercury, the game is split into themed &quot;Labs&quot; rather than &quot;Worlds&quot;. There are 10 Labs, with 16 initial stages: Astro, Bio, Chemical, Electro, Geo, Atom, Aero, Hydro, Micro, V.R. (Virtual Reality). The PS2 version adds two more: Chrono and Cryo, as well as twin analog control, support for the rumble feature, improved graphics and all the levels from the original Archer Maclean&apos;s Mercury. There are 168 stages in the PSP version and over 200 in the PS2 game. Unlike the previous game, there is no strict order to play the levels. Once a Lab has been unlocked, you can play all the stages included right away.&amp;#xA;Attributes show how well you do in the games. The best performance is awarded with a golden cork, based on four conditions: a high score (a 1 sticker), all bonus items found (a star sticker), 100% mercury (a corked test-tube), and complete the level within the time limit. While playing, your progress is measured in faces that replace the time clock. The time limit cannot cause the game to end anymore, instead it just turns into a sad face and players can still complete the level. The mercury limits have also been removed, but 100% mercury is still needed to access some of the later stages.&amp;#xA;The top right corner shows a color chart, to help with mixing colors in the game. This can also be done in the paintshop. This release adds multi-paintshops, triangle base pyramid shaped constructions with 3 different coloured gates on either side.&amp;#xA;In addition to the main game, there are now five party games, which are unlocked by collecting the bonus stars in the main game:&amp;#xA;1. Metrix: puzzle games where coloured blocks need to be fit inside a pre-defined grid.&amp;#xA;2. Paint: move the mercury to paint the tray as much as possible against your opponent.&amp;#xA;3. Race: guide mercury around speedy track with boost pads and avoid falling off.&amp;#xA;4. Rodeo: tilt the playing area to keep the mercury on the field, while a fan tries to knock you off.&amp;#xA;2. Shove: aim the mercury for the center spot of the target, just like curling.&amp;#xA;All the party games can be played in multiplayer over Wi-Fi on the PSP. The tutorial is now separate from the main game, and there is an additional Playground mode where you can test the different items in the game.</plot>

  <plot>Solid Snake is back! Blueprints of the original Metal Gear have leaked out onto the black market. Metal Gear Ray is developed to combat these new Metal Gears. During transport Metal Gear Ray is captured, but others have their own intentions...&amp;#xA;In the sequel, you once again resume the role of Solid Snake. You start the game in the rain, with a tranquilizer gun, which put the guards to sleep (instantly if you perform a successful headshot). There are a host of weapons to be picked up through out the game, some old, such as the FAMAS and Socom, and some new, such as the AK-47.&amp;#xA;Snake can perform all his old moves, as well as some new ones. Martial arts combos can be used to disable guards. He can crawl through small spaces, peek around corners and perform acrobatic leaps to get away. Snake can also hang from railings, effectively hiding from guards. He can also stick his gun in a guards back, surprising him. The cardboard box is also back, and can once again be used for hiding.&amp;#xA;Snake has his usual array of gadgets, his sneak suit and others can be found along the way, a mine detector, thermal goggles. The radar from the original game is still there and alerts you to guards positions and also shows you their field of view. As in the original though, if an alarm is sounded the radar is disabled while you escape. In some situations you will need to enable the radar before you can use it.&amp;#xA;The codec is also back. It is once again integral to the story, and even comes on sometimes in the heat of battle. If you get stuck in the game, it provides hints on what to do. Repeated calls yield more intuitive help on what to do.&amp;#xA;The guards in the game are a lot more wary in the sequel. If you get spotted by a guard, he will call for re-inforcements. You have a few seconds before he does this so you can shoot out his radio and disable him. However, other guards check why their buddy hasn&apos;t reported in and will come looking for him.&amp;#xA;All the cutscenes in the game use the in-game 3D engine, seamlessly blending action and story. All the characters movements are motion captured animations. All locations feature interactive environments, such as, shooting a bottle which will shatter into fragments or ice that actually melts if you stick around to watch it!&amp;#xA;The music in the game changes with the action, if you get into heated battle, the music becomes frantic, and slows down once the battle is over. Some sequences in the game even support Dolby 5.1.</plot>

  <plot>Snake is back... but this time literally back in time. Not a sequel to MGS2, but a new game with a setting before all the other Metal Gear games thus far. The time of Cold War, 1960&apos;s.&amp;#xA;But, how is Snake still Snake back in time, not looking any younger. Well in fact, he is looking younger, as you no longer play The Solid Snake, and if you ever wondered who was the renowned super-soldier that Liquid, Solid, and Solidus were all clones of, you&apos;ll meet him in battle for survival in this 3D action-adventure game.&amp;#xA;The survival of the fittest still works, but this time it&apos;s not only about dodging enemy bullets and staying out of sight. You have to think of your stamina, and as it goes along with survival, you gotta eat sometimes. And to help you blend with the environment, Snake is wearing a large stash of camouflaged uniforms.&amp;#xA;So, the Cold War, a situation created after the Second World War when the world was torn between East and West, is about to heat up as Soviets got their top scientist, Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, back due to agreement with the US government for withdrawing the nuclear missiles from Cuba. Now, with Sokolov in their hands, they&apos;re up to developing a nightmarish new weapon, and upon realizing the urgency of the situation, CIA formed a plan to recapture Sokolov, and they dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov&apos;s research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit&apos;s modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking mission.&amp;#xA;August 24, 1964, a lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man&apos;s code name is Naked Snake... and things are about to escalate. It&apos;s a one-man war now, and the future of the world may now rests entirely on his shoulders now.</plot>

  <plot>A follow-up to the Metal Max games, Metal Saga is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its predecessors - a world populated by bounty hunters, rangers, bandits, and mutant monsters. You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for &quot;wanted&quot; people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil.&amp;#xA;Metal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max&apos;s trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the 80&apos;s TV series of the same name, this is a 3rd person shooter. Playing as Sonny Crockett or Ricardo Tubbs, the player must dismantle drug-lord Ortega&apos;s organization, following the plot of an episode of the series.&amp;#xA;Through 14 missions, the player must take down (or arrest, sometimes) drug dealers and solve some minor puzzles (like finding keys to open doors, or switching levers to get access to locked places). In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns, etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don&apos;t.&amp;#xA;In the stages where the player can choose either Crockett or Tubbs, basic commands can be given to the secondary character, such as asking for following the partner or covering him. The characters will heal themselves as the time passes, and they can heal each other: if one of them dies, the other can revive him.&amp;#xA;The characters can interact with the environment: whenever an action is possible, an icon will appear, showing which action can be taken, such as opening (or breaking) doors, climbing ladders, etc. Jumping is part of those particular actions, as the characters can only jump at specific places where the proper icon shows up. As for other actions, characters can run, crouch, walk and lean against walls. To shoot enemies, the player must aim (with an auto aim button) and then shoot (with a shoot button).&amp;#xA;The game features the original theme from the TV show, as well as original voices.</plot>

  <plot>In Michigan, players take the role of a rookie cameraman for ZaKa TV, the entertainment division of the powerful ZaKa conglomerate. Accompanied by Brisco, an outspoken sound engineer, and Pamela, a reporter, the player is sent to investigate a mysterious mist that has descended over the city. The player quickly discovers that the mist is somehow transforming people into fleshy, leech-like monsters with human limbs. Pamela is attacked by the creatures, and is later found in the process of transforming into one. The player, Brisco, and a new female reporter are sent to investigate the source of the monster outbreak. It is eventually revealed that the cause of the monsters is a mutative virus developed by a scientist, Dr. O&apos;Conner, intended to be used as a biological weapon against the enemies of the United States. The virus was developed with the complicity of the U.S. military, the U.S. government, as well as the powerful ZaKa group for whom the protagonists work. After unsuccessfully attempting to retrieve a vaccine for the virus, the camera crew attempt to evacuate the city by heading to an airport on the outskirts of the city where a military evacuation transport is supposed to arrive. At the airport, the group encounters a strange young man who appears to be intellectually disabled. He somewhat disjointedly reveals that he was Dr. O&apos;Conner&apos;s original guinea pig, and begins to run around and yell immaturely in a bizarre manner. After the player commands the reporter to shoot the strange man, he transforms into a massive pile of mutated flesh before exploding messily. With the man&apos;s death, the mist clears, and Brisco theorizes he was the cause of both the mist and the monster outbreak. In the game&apos;s epilogue, the camera crew approach a nearby lighthouse, which the military has ordered them to activate so that the transport plane can locate them and pick them up. While the tired reporter waits outside, Brisco and the cameraman ascend the lighthouse and activate the light at the top. Suddenly, Brisco begins to mutate; the cameraman flees, and the Brisco-creature laughs maniacally before escaping out a window. The game ends with a final film clip depending on the actions of cameraman. The cameraman attempts to reveal the identity of the people behind the virus on camera, but he&apos;s killed by an unseen assassin before he gives a name. </plot>

Keep track of your achievements as you progress and if you choose, you can even skip parts of the game to your at bats or pitching appearances, making the game much more streamlined and very personal.&amp;#xA;The players act very realistic due to the fact they used motion capturing for almost every major player, giving it untolds&amp;#xA;amounts of realistic animation and almost giving them real emotions, such as if a pitcher gives up a big home run, you can see the disappointed on his face or if you hit a game winning home run your entire team goes nuts celebrating.&amp;#xA;The game also comes with a fun set of mini games including the classic Home Run Derby and a new King of the Diamond, which has multiple levels, a timer and is constantly adapting to keep you guessing. The rosters even were up to date at the time, actually having the 2006 rosters instead of the previous year.</plot>

  <plot>Sony&apos;s baseball franchise returns for 2007 with updated rosters and classic features, such as season mode, managerial mode along with the classic career mode, but also has some new features as well.&amp;#xA;One of the new features is the Road to the Show, a new take on the career mode that expands last years version. Instead of playing every player on the team, the game focuses more on the player alone. It will fast forward to decisions tied to the player (i.e. fielding a ball hit towards your player or batting), but also gives you goals to complete (i.e. knocking in a run or getting on base or trying for a double play while fielding). Success of these goals will help you establish your place with the manager and team and give you a better chance for a major league start.&amp;#xA;It also features an Adaptive Pitching Intelligence, where the game learns more from your at bats or your pitching, but also has your catchers help you out more by picking signals out instead of just randomly selecting pitches. Another is umpire personality, where the strike zone is smaller or larger, depending upon the umpire calling the game at the time.&amp;#xA;The all-new New Pitch Command System (PCS) delivers comprehensive strategy to pitch selection, as a pitcher&apos;s &quot;pitch comfort&quot; will be predetermined based on a best to worst pitch scenario, letting you decide whether to stick with what is working or begin a new pitching regiment.&amp;#xA;PS2 and PS3 versions provide online league play, which also lets you check on real-time MLB scores and news while the PSP version also lets you play against others using Wi-Fi connection.&amp;#xA;It features an extensive MLB license, with most of the players with a few exceptions and also features Rex Hudler, Matt Vasgersian and Dave Campbell as color commentators, providing realistic coverage, almost giving it a TV feel along with realistic graphics, giving the players and the action a very realistic feel, such as a pitchers let down after giving up a huge homerun or a team rushing the field to celebrate after hitting a homerun, winning the game.</plot>

  <plot>Monster Attack is a third-person action shooter and the first game in the Chikyuu Boueigun / Earth Defense Force series. The player takes the role of an EDF (Earth Defence Force) infantry man to single handily battle hordes of giant bugs, robots and alien ships that have invaded Earth, across 30 missions. The game eludes to other EDF forces, but they are never seen. You choose two weapons for each mission from dozens of various missile launchers, machine guns, flamethrowers and more unique weapons, some, faster, more powerful or better suited to the mission at hand than others, are given infinite ammo (though the weapons must still be reloaded after each clip is used up) and are set loose in one of several (usually city-based) fully destructible environments. Players can also mount a vehicles such as an air bike, a tank and a helicopter. The player recovers and increases his maximum health and armour, and unlocks new weapons by picking up power-ups from defeated enemies that spawn in and come at the player by the dozen. The game also features 2-player split-screen cooperative multiplayer.</plot>

  <plot>The house that old man Nebbercracker owns is alive and is swallowing whole anything that comes close to it. Three neighborhood kids DJ, Chowder, and Jenny decided to plan an attack on the house on Hallows&apos; Eve. There plans go array when police officers catch them attempting to break into the house and place the kids in the back of a police car. However, the house swallows the police officers and then swallows the police car holding the children. Now that the children are in the belly of the beast, they have to find a way to put a stop to this monster house. In Monster House players have to explore the house while taking on the role of the three children (the game will automatically switch to a different character as the story calls for it). Each child is armed with a water blaster and a melee attack to take out enemies. The water blasters reservoir will get drained each time it&apos;s fired and will require an occasional re-pumping to refill it. Also, each child has a unique limited ammo weapon, DJ has an instant camera which can stun enemies with its flash, Jenny has a slingshot which shoots marbles, and Chowder has water balloons to soak enemies. Players can find items like keys to unlock doors, cans of pop to regain health, and arcade tokens which can then be used to play a mini-game called Thou Art Dead, a side-scolling action game. The various bathrooms found through out the house are safe zones and will allow the player to save their game. Also, finding toy monkeys scattered through out the house will unlock game art which can be viewed in the game&apos;s Gallery mode.</plot>

  <plot>Monster Hunter is a third-person action game set in a kind of pre-historic fantasy world. Many of the creatures you&apos;ll see are very similar to dinosaurs, ancient relatives to modern day animals such as boars and insects, and even dragons. Next to a singleplayer mode, the game can also be played online. You can have a hunting party of up to four people, and once you start to go after larger prey, you&apos;ll definitely need them all. Every couple of weeks, Capcom organizes online missions. While some are harder than others, they all allow you the chance to create equipment you&apos;d never be able to get if you only played offline.&amp;#xA;Thankfully, you won&apos;t be fighting with your bare hands. When you first begin your game, you are given a simple sword and shield, but as you complete missions and harvest materials from both the creatures you kill and various nooks and crannies in the environments, you can begin to craft stronger weapons and armor for yourself. On top of that, you can also use berries, plants, shells and more to craft healing items, stat boosters and even ammunition if you opt to use a bowgun.&amp;#xA;There are several weapon types in Monster Hunter, including the bowgun (perfect for group support and long-range attacks), Great Swords (huge and slow, but very powerful and a great reach), and even Hammers (The most powerful weapon class, but cannot block). Most weapons can even be upgraded once you create them, allowing you to add damage, sharpness and even elemental attributes.&amp;#xA;The game is played out through missions you take from the Hunter&apos;s Guild (or the village elder if you&apos;re playing solo), and these missions range from material gathering, to egg stealing, and even live capture. Combat is all real-time. The left analog stick moves your hunter while the right stick is actually used for attacking. Different directions on the stick trigger different types of attacks, even allowing for some simple combos.&amp;#xA;The story in Monster Hunter is a very basic one. You want to be the best Hunter ever, so you go out to prove yourself. That&apos;s really all there is to it.</plot>

  <plot>Monster Jam is a monster truck racing game based on the existing TV-show under the same name, which also incorporates a series of live events hosted by Live Nation. Unlike previous games of Monster Jam franchise, Monster Jam includes 20 pre-existing trucks licensed specifically for the game by USHRA (United States Hot Rod Association). The game includes such well-known monster trucks as Destroyer, Bounty Hunter, Blue Thunder, Captain&apos;s Cruise, it&apos;s previous identity - Bulldozer and probably two of the most alleged kings of all monster trucks - Maximum Destruction, the winner of seven Monster Jam World Finals and Grave Digger, one of the most influential monster trucks of all time .&amp;#xA;At the beginning of the game only a small amount of trucks and tracks is available for choosing. The player is encouraged to participate in various events to attain career points which will unlock new items. The amount of points given depend on the player&apos;s performance in the following events:&amp;#xA; Freestyle - a classic monster truck challenge involves free-riding at the arena performing different stunts and interacting with the surrounding environment in the most destructive way possible. In this challenge it is advisable to &quot;keep the action going&quot; until the time runs out. Also, a combo of different stunts in a succession will result in magnifying the score.&amp;#xA;Track Circuit - an offroad lap-based racing through various types of countryside.&amp;#xA;Eliminator - is the classic knock-out race in which each lap eliminates the last truck to complete it.&amp;#xA;Stadium Circuit - is the same as Track Circuit with the action taking the place in the arena, and not at outdoors locations and the trucks competing at different tracks separated from each other.&amp;#xA;Stadium Racing - is a drag racing challenge in which players should boost their maximum speed in order to arrive first at the finish of a short un-circled track.&amp;#xA;Once the sufficient number points is achieved the player will be allowed to participate in Monster Jam World Finals to prove his right to be the ultimate champion of Monster Jam.&amp;#xA;The game makes heavy emphasis on it&apos;s fully destructible levels. Nearly everything player meets on the track may be crushed, moved or destroyed. The game encourages such kind of behavior by issuing additional points and allowing player to use &quot;nitro boost&quot; for a prolonged amount of time.&amp;#xA;The game may be played in two difficulty modes: &quot;Normal&quot; - is enough for everyone, while &quot;Pro&quot; is meant for die-hard Monster Truck enthusiasts only.</plot>

Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast&apos;s Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo.&amp;#xA;The game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful PS2 console. Most of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.</plot>

This game improves upon previous installments by allowing more than one monster to be raised at once, interaction with the main character and the monsters, improved explorations, a customizable ranch, tag-team battles, improved 2P mode, a re-vamped battle system, and more detailed monsters. This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date.&amp;#xA;Your goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode.&amp;#xA;The game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.&amp;#xA;Monsters can also be made by finding in-game items, and through combining your retired monsters, so having a large collection of discs is not necessary. The game features some cute monsters, some scary/gory types, and enough variety to keep almost anyone busy for a long time.&amp;#xA;Monster Rancher 4 is easy enough that almost anyone can dive in and play right away, making it a natural for kids. -But like the other games in the series, a patient player will be rewarded with a deeper, more rewarding experience (and hundreds of hours of gameplay). Replay value on this game, like the other Monster Rancher games is very high.</plot>

  <plot>Monster Rancher EVO is totally unlike any other games in this series, so fans beware, this may not be what you expect!&amp;#xA;Like the previous Monster Rancher titles, EVO does involve raising monsters, but that&apos;s where the similarities end. Gone is your ranch and in its place is a circus. You are still a monster breeder, but raising your monster is now a group effort. You train your monsters each day to perform tricks for a circus show, and they only gain stats (Life, Speed, Strength, etc.) during &quot;Showtime.&amp;#xA;Shows are performed once every few months. Performing shows is necessary for monster growth and circus popularity. Increasing your popularity will enable you to move the circus (and advance the plot) into other areas of the game.&amp;#xA;In addition to &quot;Showtimes,&quot; the game also includes &quot;Adventures,&quot; which those familiar with the series will remember. You go on adventures to obtain items necessary for mini-quests (there are many of those) and to further advance the plot. These adventures are full of challenges and ways to improve your monster, as in the other MR games.&amp;#xA;An important thing to remember about this game is that you are not the sole trainer. In face, you do very little training because you assign others in your circus group to do it for you. That being said, MR EVO is a very plot-oriented game, with less of an emphasis on combat than its predecessors.</plot>

  <plot>Monster Trux Extreme: Offroad Edition, as the name implies, is a Monster Truck arcade racing game. There are 3 engine classes to choose from: V6, V8 or V12. There are also 8 different trucks to choose from, and a total of 12 different courses (some of which consist in a previous course mirrored or in a different daytime condition). At first, only one engine class, two trucks and one courses will be available, the others having to be unlocked while playing the game. Each race is played against 3 computer opponents (or 2 in split-screen mode). During the races, 2 types of power ups can be collected: wrenches and nitros. Wrenches recover the trucks&apos; damage gauge, and come in two types, one that repairs one unity of the damage gauge and one which fully repairs the truck. Nitros can be used to boost the truck speed for a while, each one filling 1/3 of the trucks&apos; nitro gauge. If the player runs over yellow speed stripes on the courses, a little speed boost will be gained. Dollar symbols can also be collected, adding money to the player&apos;s profile. Money can be used to unlock new trucks, but it isn&apos;t spent: to unlock a new truck, the player only has to have the required amount of money. Money can be lost if the player depletes the whole damage gauge by bumping into obstacles or other vehicles: the truck explodes and respawns at the cost of 10 money units. </plot>

During the course of the game the player takes control over three characters from the movie which all feature different gameplay elements. Missing Link, a mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games from animated movies: a 3rd person platformer.&amp;#xA;The sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use them to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing bars - if B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has to solve mazes and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited time).&amp;#xA;In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this case: levels) or audio commentaries.</plot>

  <plot>Mortal Kombat: Armageddon brags a roster of 62 characters and sees the return of classic ones from the original Mortal Kombat, such as Reptile, Shang Tsung and Goro. The enhanced Konquest mode (story/adventure mode) improves over the preceding versions, but has a shorter length. There are now 64 arenas (including revamped versions of classic environments) which each have their own tweaks, such as the ridiculous amount of stage fatalities (fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent, including classic techniques such as the &quot;spine-rip&quot; or &quot;arm-break&quot;).&amp;#xA;In the new Kreate-a-character mode, you can design your own character and clothe them with familiar or new costumes. As described earlier, fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent and are pretty fun to watch. Various button presses and combos at the end of a fight will sometimes trigger fatality mode and if the right buttons are pressed the fatality can become a chain of fatalities. The Kreate-a-fatality allows you to redesign these finishers.&amp;#xA;Perhaps the most amusing addition for longtime fans is the debut of &quot;Motor Kombat,&quot; a racing mini-game patterned after Nintendo&apos;s Mario Kart. Motor Kombat has players selecting a vehicle from the following ten characters: Sub-Zero, Bo&apos; Rai Cho, Scorpion, Mileena, Kitana, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Baraka, and Raiden. Each super-deformed driver performs his or her trademark move on rivals, from Raiden&apos;s electricity to Scorpion&apos;s spear attack. The themed courses also feature hazards of their own, including lava pools, spikes, fire, and more. Motor Kombat supports four players in a split-screen view, or up to eight online.</plot>

  <plot>Mr. Golf is a one to four player golf game. This is not a simulation where real players and courses are recreated in minute photorealistic detail, this is a fun game where the players are all drawn in a cute cartoony style and the courses are all fictitious. There are two modes of play, stroke play or match play. Matches can be over three, six, nine or eighteen holes. Initially there are six characters to play as and just four courses but others can be unlocked by winning full eighteen hole matches. There is no player creation feature, no career mode and no difficulty settings in this game. There is background music and an in-game commentary which was a surprise but this is limited to stock phrases such as &apos;Nice shot!&apos;, &apos;You&apos;ve kept it on the fairway&apos;, &apos;Bad luck&apos; and so on. There is an in-game tutorial which covers all the controls. By default the right analogue stick controls the shot, the further back it is pulled the more power is transferred to the swing when the stick is pushed forward, while the left analogue stick aims the shot so that the player can allow for the wind. There is a game configuration option that swaps the use of the right/left sticks around. The &apos;best&apos; club is auto selected by the game but this can be changed by using R1/L1 to cycle through available clubs, R2/L2 change the player&apos;s stance. When taking a shot the player can take as many practice swings as they like to gauge how much back swing they want to use, the right D-Pad button swaps the player from practice mode into shot mode to take the actual shot. The full game has fourteen playable characters, eight courses plus &apos;mirrored courses&apos; all of which can be played in any of four seasons. </plot>

Far in the future a machine called the &quot;G System&quot; is created which allows energy and materials to be turned into objects. Shortly after civilization is nearly destroyed by the machine, an event called The Great Fall. The games story begins after The Great Fall; what&apos;s left of mankind has begun to rebuild and stabilize a new society. One day a mysterious mobile suit arrives and initiates some random attacks on various towns, including an orphanage which is destroyed leaving only two survivors, Tristan and Fritz. These two survivors will then embark on a mission to take revenge for the destruction of their orphanage, and along the way will learn the mobile suit responsible for the destruction is part of even bigger plot to take over the world.&amp;#xA;At the beginning of the game you control Tristan and Fritz; as the story progresses, other characters will both join and leave your party. Each of the characters in your party has a mobile suit which is used to fight in battles as well as explore the vast regions of the world. You will also come across various towns where the characters can leave the mobile suits; in the towns you can talk with people, visit shops to buy items, rest to regain health and save the game, as well as learn about new missions to undertake. In most areas except towns (such as exploring the lands or in dungeons) you will encounter battles in both random locations and set locations; the set location battles are indicated by glowing crystals on the screen and are usually located strategically blocking an area you need to get to or to advance the story.&amp;#xA;The game uses a turn based battle system. Different types of attacks are available; hand to hand attacks tend to be more powerful but leave you open to a counter attack while ranged attacks are safer but deal less damage. On each turn each member of your party is given a limited amount of energy to use for attacks; different attacks use different amounts of energy. Lower powered attacks typically use less than the energy quota for a turn allowing you to save up the unused energy for a more powerful attack in a later turn. Each character also has a limited number of technique points which can be used for additional abilities such as healing, increasing armor, special attacks, and so on. At any given time up to three characters can be in the front line and take action in battles; any additional characters remain in the back line and are unable to attack, however you can switch characters around on each turn. As you win battles, experience points are earned allowing your characters to level up and become more powerful.</plot>

  <plot>The Muppets remember the fun times they had on their last vacation in this 4-player party game. This game follows the pattern of most party games, like Mario Party, for example, in that your overall goal is to win a board game. To win the board game, you must succeed at a variety of mini games, which may include a wide variety of gameplay styles. Winning a mini game earns you a party favor of a certain color. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most party favors to win. Party favors you win can then be used to unlock additional mini games and bonus videos. If you unlock enough mini games, you can then unlock a new game board in the main game.&amp;#xA;You can choose to play as Gonzo, Animal, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Pepe, or Fonzie. In addition, a lot of other Muppet characters have cameo appearances.</plot>

  <plot>Mushihimesama is a vertically scrolling shooter; players need to control their character over the constantly scrolling terrain and score points by shooting the various enemies that appear. Each of the five stages ends with a large &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; battle. Like other games from developer CAVE, Mushihimesama is a &amp;quot;bullet hell&amp;quot; style shooter; the numerous opponents you encounter fire a very significant number of bullets, often completely covering the entire playfield. The player will need to either dodge these by navigating through the complex pattern formed or by utilising the shield that is available for a limited time. As is typical for arcade style shooters, weapon upgrades are available to make blasting enemies easier.&amp;#xA;Mushihimesama features three difficulty levels, original arcade, maniac, and ultra. In addition to these three modes found in the original arcade version, the PS2 version also adds a practice mode where any stage and boss battle can be practiced as well as the arrange mode. In arrange mode, the player begins fully equipped with weapon upgrades and changes are made to the scoring system.</plot>

But the situation isn&apos;t going very well. No horse has won for a few seasons and even worse, some are falling sick. As the story unfolds we realise that the only way to get the ranch out from its financial problems is to win the final race in Kentucky.&amp;#xA;Other changes: new five mini-games loosely connected to the horse riding called &quot;fun games&quot; to unlock: Gather the foals, Play with a ball, Break in the Bull, Race with Katelyn, Labyrinth.&amp;#xA;In &quot;My Horse and Me&quot; on the Wii platform, the horse jumps automatically and we steer the horse by moving wiimote and nunchuck up and down. In the second part, we steer the horse by turning wiimote and nunchuck left and right. We can also choose whether we jump automatically or by pressing the A button. Differences in gameplay are only because of different control (wiimote / keyboard / pad).&amp;#xA;The game is also licensed by Federation Equestre Internationale FEI (International Equestrian Federation).</plot>

The player takes the role of a hero who fights against the evil ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple: the player wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. He has the choice between eight characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages - but basically the player chooses between sword and magical attacks. He can also use combo attacks.&amp;#xA;During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact, some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for this and gets to retain their abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe. Besides the main story mode, there is also a Survival mode.&amp;#xA;This version of the game features several additions in comparison to the GameCube version: increased magic levels (depending on the runes equipped), four new playable characters, a new boss, levels can be chosen separately after beating the game, plus the new Mission Mode. In this mode, the player has to solve small missions, e.g. defending a castle or escorting ghosts.</plot>

  <plot>NARC is a 3rd-person shooter that has the player tracking the distribution of the deadly new narcotic &quot;Liquid Soul&quot; across two different cities in Asia and the U.S.A. The player controls one of two characters - Narcotics detective Jack Forezenski (voiced by Michael Madsen), or D.E.A. agent Marcus Hill (voiced by Bill Belamy). Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds.&amp;#xA;As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their &quot;badge rating&quot; (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small &quot;struggle&quot; minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.&amp;#xA;Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points.&amp;#xA;Players have a maximum badge rating of 100. If it drops below 49, they are demoted to Patrolman and cannot take new story missions. The player must roam the streets in their police blues and stop enough random crimes to be moved back to Narcotics. If the player&apos;s rating drops below 24, they are kicked off the force and rendered jobless. Jobless players cannot fight or shoot weapons without attracting police attention. Further drops in rating cause the player to be wanted by the police, with a rating of 5 or lower spawning officers specifically to shoot or arrest the player.&amp;#xA;There are 25 hidden drug stashes in each city. Finding all of them will unlock the original N.A.R.C. arcade game for play.</plot>

  <plot>Based off Masashi Kishimoto&apos;s manga and anime Naruto, Ultimate Ninja is the first installment of the Ultimate Ninja series, known in Japan as the Narutimate Hero series. It is a fighting game with cel-shaded graphics resembling figures straight out of the manga. Ultimate Ninja contains twelve characters from the show, each with their own unique movesets and special attacks. In the overseas versions, two more bonus characters were added: Curse Mark Sasuke and Nine-Tailed Naruto. These were already playable in the Japanese version as a stronger mode for the regular characters, but split off into separate characters for the other versions. As such, the base characters cannot transform into these variations in the versions released outside of Japan.&amp;#xA;The characters can fight in several locations seen in the show and comics, such as Hidden Leaf Village, the Chunin Exam arena, and the Forest of Death. There is a main story mode with six battles and dialogue between the characters.</plot>

  <plot>Based on Masashi Kishimoto&apos;s manga (and anime adaptation later) Naruto, Ultimate Ninja 2 is the second installment of the Ultimate Ninja series. The current Naruto game has cel shaded graphics and features the following modes: Ultimate Road, VS. Duel, Iruka&apos;s Training, Naruto&apos;s House and Tanzaku Market.&amp;#xA;1. Ultimate Road: Ultimate Road is your basic story mode and focuses on the events that took place on the finals of the Chunin Exam up to the point where Tsunade agrees to become the 5th Hokage. There is also an additional story that revolves around Tsunade and becomes accessible when you finish the main story. The particular mode features pre-rendered backgrounds that you can freely move within and 4 locations including the Village Hidden in the Leaves and Tanzaku Town. To advance the story you need to talk to certain people and win a row of battles each time. With each battle you&apos;re given certain conditions that should be met in order to win. Such conditions are simply to win the battle, fight till time is up or more challenging like win the battle - with enemy&apos;s defense power high. For specific events you may also choose a support character, before the battle starts, that will appear at regular intervals to give you items like shuriken and ninja scrolls that can be thrown to the enemy. The battles are one on one and play like in Vs. Duel mode. When the battle ends you get money and points depending on how many of your available moves you used, how many items you used, in how many arenas you fought, etc. You can spend money on Tanzaku Market and can use points to customize your characters&apos; stats like Attack and Defense from the menu. From the menu you can also check any missions available. Missions are actually battles with conditions such as the ones that are mentioned at the beginning but are of wider variety and higher difficulty.&amp;#xA;2. VS. Duel: A versus fighting mode where you can choose your fighter and the opponent from 32 players available to fight versus the CPU or a human player. You start with 17 players and can unlock the rest by talking to them or defeating them in a fight in Ultimate Road mode. In the battle you get your basic moves like the substitution jutsu, double jump, blocking, etc. that are the same for all the players and combos and special techniques that are different to each character and do more damage than your normal moves. The arenas have multi-layers and destructible objects that reveal items you can throw or points to replenish your chakra (it can also be replenished by throwing your opponent to the ground or holding down the down cursor button). Chakra is what some combos and all 3 levels of special techniques need to execute. When executing special techniques you are given the chance to interact with them. For example you may have to continuously push a certain button, rotate the right analog stick or press a combo of buttons that appear on the screen. If done correctly you may proceed to the next &quot;stage&quot; of the attack, add critical damage to it or reduce damage and/or cancel a technique if it&apos;s initiated by the opponent.&amp;#xA;3. Iruka&apos;s Training: This is a practice mode where you can choose any of the 32 players available and master their moves.&amp;#xA;4. Naruto&apos;s House: Here you can view items bought at Tanzaku Market as well as enter codes.&amp;#xA;5. Tanzaku Market: In Tanzaku Market you can buy Figures, Videos, Music, Ninja Info Cards, etc. that can be viewed at Naruto&apos;s House.</plot>

A new feature is the Adrenaline meter. When full, it offers improved handling and speed. Drivers now carry ranks with different attributes (Dynamic Driver Attributes) and racing tendencies. Specific drivers will perform better on certain tracks. Players can earn skill points to improve their attributes by keeping a lead, making clean passes, intimidation or survive dangerous situations.&amp;#xA;The main modes are Race Now, Season Mode, Chase for the Cup, Fight to the Top (Whelen Modified series, Craftsman Series, Craftsman Trucks, NBS, and NEXTEL Cup), Online Races (Quick Matches and Optimatch - where the host can fully define the event) and Dodge Challenges. The Dodge Speed Zone mode is no longer included. Important racers are shown in FMV interviews prior to Dodge Challenge races. As usual, the car can be tweaked and fine-tuned in many ways.&amp;#xA;This is the first NASCAR game to appear on the PSP. It is fairly similar to the console versions, but does not include Total Team Control to talk with the team. The handheld version includes a new feature: Instant Rewind. While racing, a meter builds up with time, which can be used to rewind the game action when crashing or taking a bad turn.

  <plot>The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.&amp;#xA;Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year&apos;s edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.&amp;#xA;The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.&amp;#xA;The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.</plot>

A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.&amp;#xA;The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</plot>

For each one of the 15 Blacklisted opponents, the player must win a specific number of events from each of the two main types and gain enough notoriety in the process. The player can invest bet money to buy new cars or improve his existing one&apos;s looks and performance so that he remains competitive.&amp;#xA;In Most Wanted, Josie Maran replaces Brooke Burke as the racer girl. The plot is furthered through use of FMV video with live actors and digital sets, which has been heavily enhanced so that it looks quite real.</plot>

Instead the player freely roams the big city in his cars and accepts missions at every corner. These range from simple races to Burnout-inspired &quot;Destroy as much as possible&quot; goals. A completely new mode is the Highway Battle in which the player needs to put 300 meters between him and his opponent with the main enemy being the incoming rush hour traffic. Other missions require the player to bring a specific car in the best possible condition to a garage. Since the player is undercover, the police is always watching him and makes his life more and more difficult as the wanted level of the car increases.&amp;#xA;Successful races not only earn the player reputation to unlock new challenges and new parts of the city but also bring cash which can be invested in new cars or in the tuning of old ones. In addition one of the ten stats of the character automatically advances granting him more money for a win or increasing his ability to brake.</plot>

  <plot>NFL Blitz Pro is the 2003 entry in Midway&apos;s arcade football series. Like NHL Hitz Pro however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can &quot;catch on fire&quot;. The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays. Game modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates. The game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games. Available for purchase are fantasy teams and stadiums, and new game modes: in Butterfingaz mode, every hit leads to a fumble, while Cyberleague features robot teams and an exploding ball. Also available is the customary Big Head mode, among several others. Old-school Blitz series arcade gameplay is available in Blitz Classic mode.</plot>

  <plot>Play a full season with your favorite team or try the franchise mode and build a legacy. You can even create teams and players.&amp;#xA;In general manager mode, when you go into the off-season, several different things happen. First, you&apos;ll see a list of players who have retired from your team and the reasons they&apos;ve left, which are usually related to injuries or diminishing skills. If you lose some key players, then you&apos;ll need to make every effort to ensure that those positions are filled by free agents with similar skills or rookies who have solid potential. You&apos;re frequently stuck with trying your luck in the draft, where you can select a rookie based on how you finished the season, like in the real NFL draft. GameDay has a feature that gives you a breakdown on the draft and provides you with an overall rating for each rookie. Following the draft, you have to sign your rookies with whatever cap money you&apos;ve set aside for that purpose. When you&apos;re all done, it&apos;s time to start the next season.&amp;#xA;There&apos;s also a tournament mode where you can select up to 16 teams. There&apos;s also a regular season mode, similar to the franchise mode, except it lacks the off-season part.&amp;#xA;GameDay&apos;s best new feature is online play support. You can view your online stats, and see who the best players are online to challenge.</plot>

Players try to become the world&apos;s best urban footballer by conquering other teams using several gravity-defying tricks like up-the-wall passes, off-the-wall catches, and highlight-reel wall jukes.&amp;#xA;Like the other games in the Street franchise, the game is played with a small amount of players and a focus on arcade gameplay. Unlike the first game, the walls can now be used for run-up passes and receptions, or bonuses by aiming for posters and hotspots.&amp;#xA;There are twelve arenas to compete in (2 unlockable) and the players are licensed from the 2004 NFL rosters. Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends. Progress is based on milestones where you sharpen specific skills to reach the top or beat sufficient teams. When five days are left, the team enters a final tournament.&amp;#xA;Another one is the new Own the City mode, where the player create a new character and has to win all street games in the city. New players need to be recruited from pick-up games. The final team to beat consists of rapper Xzibit and a team of NFL stars. Characters created in this mode can be imported into the NFL Challenge, but also in Madden NFL 06.&amp;#xA;The PSP version is a faithful port, with some of the cut scenes removed, and 3 new street modes added for Wi-Fi multiplayer: Street Slalom (an obstacle course), Style Point Challenge, and Style Standoff, a end zone dance contest, similar to Space Channel 5, next to the regular multiplayer modes.

The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull&apos;s-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players&apos; momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts.&amp;#xA;With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for &quot;face sculpting&quot; - changing the different features.&amp;#xA;All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team.&amp;#xA;The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</plot>

  <plot>Updated to the 2007 NHL season, the NHL 2K7 ice-hockey game also includes a few changes from NHL 2K6, including an improved camera that gives a better view of the action while still showing the field. This parametric camera is closer down than a typical top-down camera and includes automatic zooming and turning based on the players&apos; position on the ice. Other improvements are the option to shadow opponents to put pressure on them and increase their chance of making a mistake. This is done by holding the left bumper and steering the right control stick towards another player. The amount of pressure can then be determined through taps, with hard tapping inevitably leading to a powerful check.&amp;#xA;Aside from that, the game modes from the previous version are identical, as is most of the gameplay and the mini-games included. It has a new rivalry system where statistical bonuses and takeaways are created depending on how players play in games against their rival teams. The main improvements introduced to the Xbox 360 version of the game, such as the &quot;cinematic&quot; presentation system, are not carried over. This is most visible in the graphical area.</plot>

  <plot>NHL 2K9 is 2K Sports&apos; entry into Hockey gaming for the 2008-2009 season. The game is built on the same engine that many of the previous 2K hockey games used, and features include Season, Franchise, 2-on-2 Mini Rink, 4-on-4 Pond Hockey, and Shootout modes. Season Mode allows you to take basic control over an NHL team and guide them through an entire 82-game schedule, as well as (if you&apos;re good enough) the playoffs. Franchise is like Season Mode, but much deeper. In it, you guide a team through multiple seasons of hockey, and have control of options like drafting, contract signings, free agency, and hiring staff. The 2-on-2 and 4-on4 modes allow you and a friend to hand-pick a team of players (3 or 5, depending on the mode) and face off in a wide-open, arcade-style hockey game. Shootout works exactly like a shootout in real hockey: three skaters per side alternate taking shots at the goaltender, and most goals wins. Aside from game play modes, you also have the option of creating your own player or your own team from scratch, as well as modifying the existing roster (ie make trades, edit line combination) to your taste.&amp;#xA;NHL 2K9 is the first NHL Sports title for the Nintendo Wii. The Wii version features motion controls for shooting, passing, checking, and even fighting. There&apos;s also a new system for those who like to take control of the goaltender, which involves mimicking controller movements as they flash up on the screen in order to make saves.&amp;#xA;The PS3 and XBOX 360 version include online play, in which you can jump into a quick game with up to 11 other players, or participate in online leagues or tournaments.&amp;#xA;In the broadcast booth, Bob Cole and Harry Neal have been replaced by the San Jose Sharks&apos; announcing team of Randy Hann and Drew Remenda. The game soundtrack mainly comprised of energetic rock tunes, and features the likes of The Offspring, Bad Religion, and Mastodon.</plot>

The game&apos;s Season mode now allows for trades, stat tracking, and player awards.&amp;#xA;Up to four players can play each other in exhibition mode. Season mode puts you into a standard NHL schedule, but you can change to a shorter season if you want. There is also a small numer of hockey-related minigames, such as keep-away. Franchise mode is where you pick and name your team, name your players, and play against other teams to earn experience points. Those points can be used to upgrade your players in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, and agility. After beating all the lesser teams in a tier, you can move on to battle a &quot;boss team&quot; for that region. Beating that team nets you some new equipment for your players, which also improves their stats.</plot>

  <plot>NHL Hitz Pro is Midway&apos;s 2003/2004 entry into the licensed hockey market. For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play.&amp;#xA;As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.</plot>

  <plot>NHRA Drag Racing: Countdown to the Championship is a simulation of drag-racing. It features four different classes of car (Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Motorcycle), with the PSP version having Jet Powered as a bonus in Quick Race mode. There are 5 modes: Tutorial, Quick Race, Single Event, Career, and Vs. The tutorial is a series of videos that walk the player through the steps needed to properly race without getting disqualified. Quick race lets the player select a vehicle, driver, and weather, then simply race. (Unique to the PSP version is the ability to race different classes against each other, with the less powerful car getting a head start.) Single event mode strings together multiple races. It includes 4 qualifying rounds, then the top 16 racers will move on to an elimination tournament. Career follows a driver through multiple events, tracking money from wins and spent on repairs. Vs is a quick race between two human players. On the PSP, this is done through ad-hoc wireless; on the PS2, split-screen. There are three difficulty levels: rookie, veteran, and pro. Higher difficulties have tougher opponents, and require more precise aiming. In addition, rookie difficulty allows for auto-align on the track, and auto-tuning during the pre-race tune-up. No matter what game mode is being played, the pre-race tuning is incredibly important. There is only a limited amount of time (5 minutes in rookie difficulty, 3 otherwise) to pick the best settings, and everything from tire pressure to weight distribution is included. Finally, additional drivers can be unlocked by winning championships in career mode.</plot>

The many characters present in the game affect how events turn out with their unit stats and skills. From the castle and surrounding areas, the player issues orders to manage the resources and growth of the land under the warlord&apos;s control. The construction of the village and the life of its people evolve in real-time. In battle, either field battles or sieges, up to 24 units on each side ranging from spearmen to cannon troops can engage in real-time 3D battle. Routing the enemy lowers their morale, which allows the use of charges and counter attacks. In siege battles, the adequate use of skills and resources is key to victory. When most of the land is under the player&apos;s control, the &apos;Kessen&apos; command becomes available. Kessen is an all-or-nothing all-out attack that will either result in the unification of the land, or the total loss of the player&apos;s land.</plot>

  <plot>New York Race is game about future racing. Game is inspired by Luc Besson&apos;s film &quot;Fifth Element&quot;. There are more than 30 high-tech flying machines to choose and pilot (including the notorious Taxi and the cool police car). There are four different modes available in NYR, the main one being the Championship mode that takes place over four different categories; Qualification, Beginner, Pro and Expert. Other modes include Single Race, Time Attack and the rather cool Keirin mode, that eliminates the contestant in last place at every checkpoint until the last man remains. In every race, you can pick up 4 elements which give you an added advantage: Water - leaves a liquid sphere behind you that slows your opponents down if they hit it, Fire - allows you to shoot a homing fireball at your opponents, Earth activates a temporary shield and Air - gives you a speed boost. 3 Dimensional action allows the player complete freedom of movement on a vertical and horizontal axis. The races take place on 12 tracks, which can be unlocked by advancing through levels. The tracks are divided into four districts: Jet Set, Middle Class, Seedy District and China Town.</plot>

  <plot>It has been two years since the incident at Leafmore High you witnessed in ObsCure and the survivors of the nightmare moved on to a university of Fallcreek. When they killed Herbert Friedman, the conductor of the biological experiment with the black flowers, they assumed everything was okay, of course it was not. The seeds of the flower had already spread around and it grew and blossomed without much notice. When it was discovered, that the flowers contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams, it became the new hit drug on the campus. Now the seeds begin to germinate and the bad trip turns into a horrible nightmare. The only ones that really know what is going on are the ones that are experiencing it for the second time and hide terrible secrets inside themselves...&amp;#xA;Most of the time you take control over two of the six available characters. Each one has a speciality that comes in handy in order to open blocked doors or reaching new heights. Kenny for example has more muscles than brain and is therefore able to move around crates. Mei is instead a hacker and knows how to hack access panels. You can switch between both characters at any time and if you need another character in a given situation, you can go back to a gathering point and change your team.&amp;#xA;But their wits alone can&apos;t save them from their doom so they also find several different weapons ranging from melee-weapons like a baseball bat to pistols and other weapons with a serious punch. You can also pick up chairs and tables to throw at your enemies. Early in the game you also gain a syringe with which you take samples off the dead creature-bodies. Once the syringe is full you can use it to gain a temporary boost of your abilities.&amp;#xA;As a multiplayer-treat the game features Drop in/Drop Out-coop which allows you to play the game alone and if someone comes and visits he or she can just take over the second controller and play with you.&amp;#xA;The camera is a mixture of following the character and being at a fixed position in a room but to reduce the amount of blind spots, you can also control it to a certain amount.</plot>

Phozons can also be absorbed by the character to power up their weapon.&amp;#xA;The game features 5 distinct playable characters, each with his or her own storyline intertwined into one epic tale loosely based on Richard Wagner&apos;s Der Ring des Nibelungen.</plot>

  <plot>Okage: Shadow King is an RPG with a slight twist: it&apos;s humorous.&amp;#xA;The game&apos;s premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil spirit to cure his sister of a curse that&apos;s caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you&apos;re at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world.&amp;#xA;The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.</plot>

With each defeated enemy, color returns and the natural life force slowly regenerates. While playing, players call up a canvas where they can draw with the celestial brush. New abilities and techniques are acquired as you progress.&amp;#xA;Okami is filled with large worlds and dungeons to explore on your quest to restore the lush trees and wildlife to their former glory. Many monsters and large epic boss battles come between Amaterasu and her goal. To fulfill her objective there will be many people along the way that will help her if she helps them.</plot>

Usopp Pirates challenge you to a series of 3 mini games. You begin by selecting three players for your team and each time you win a game you can select a member of the team that lost. Of course the opposite can also happen if you lose a game.&amp;#xA;Grand Tourney is a multiplayer battle tournament where you can set up to 16 human or CPU players to compete.&amp;#xA;I believe Training mode is pretty much self explanatory.&amp;#xA;And there are also 2 other modes - Treasure and One Piece Art. Basically this is where you can find all the staff you have unlocked like character endings, costume art and staff like that.&amp;#xA;Characters have basically the same button presses to perform attacks. Other than that each one has a support character that he can call to aid in the battle and 2 different unique attacks that can be used if certain conditions are met. There is also another unique attack for each character, with a long animated sequence that if you use when low on energy the enemy can be defeated with only one blow.</plot>

  <plot>It&apos;s 2032. The planet is now ruled by the World Coalition Government which annexed 80% of the countries, with the remaining quickly dragged into the WCG. While their official goal was to solve humankind&apos;s problems, it was about money. Massive spending bankrupted poorer countries, and soon all traces of individual government disappeared. For those who were poor, the situation didn&apos;t improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms. To make things worse, life outside the major cities, far from the atmosphere processors is nearly impossible, as the so-called &quot;Wilderness Preserves&quot; are poisoned, and those who venture into them risk a painful death.&amp;#xA;Konoko, fresh out from TCTF (Technology Crimes Task Force, a secret police to take cyber drugs and weapons from the streets, as well as explore the induced technophobia to operate and investigate on a blank check permission) academy is placed under the command of Terrance Griffin and Dr. Kerr and linked to a SLD - an android - called Shinatama, who is neurally linked to her. However, Konoko knows next to nothing about her past, other that she was orphaned at the age of three and felt &quot;different&quot; to other people while was being brought up under the wing of TCTF. After many years in training, she has finally the chance to prove herself to Griffin and the TCTF, and so, heads for a warehouse rumoured to be under the control of the Syndicate, a criminal organization which grew exponentially after a young man called &quot;Boss Muro&quot; climbed to the top of the organization.&amp;#xA;Inspired by the classic Anime series Ghost in the Shell by Shirow Masamune, gameplay is a mix between generic third-person shooter and a classic beat&apos;em up. While Konoko has at her disposal several hand-to-hand acrobatic moves (with more unlocked as the player advances), she can also find weapons in the levels, and the decision to go armed or bare-fisted is only up to the player. Each weapon either draws from ballistic or energy cell clips, the number of rounds in each clip depending on the weapon: a Black Adder (a short, one-hand machine gun like an Uzi) can get 30 rounds from a ballistic clip, while a Mercury Bow (a sniper railgun sans scope) only two. Combined with the limited availability of clips, this adds a strategic element to the game, as the player can only carry a weapon at a time, so if a powerful weapons runs out of ammo, the player must choose between keeping the weapon and fight hand to hand with the enemies until Konoko finds fresh ammo clips, or discard it for a lesser gun that uses different ammo. However, if the player runs out of ammo completely when facing a tough challenge, Konoko can &quot;overdose&quot; on hypo sprays (used to heal damage) by using them over her natural health bar, which provides her with faster movement and tougher blows.</plot>

You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres.&amp;#xA;With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke&apos;s health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke&apos;s companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.</plot>

  <plot>Based on Sony Animation Studios&apos;s first movie, you play the character of Boog, a domesticated bear who tries to return to the civilization after being released in a nearby forest due to an unfortunate misadventure, and Elliot, a crazy deer who acts as the alter-ego of the bear.&amp;#xA;In order to achieve its goal, Boog will have to prove itself to the creatures of the forest by helping them to get rid of the hunters. By gaining their respect, the creatures help you to reach its hometown.&amp;#xA;Open Season is a game in third-person view. You control the main character in the forest and use the different forest creatures to resolve simple puzzles (considering the target age for the game) by throwing them. You can collect &quot;achievement points&quot; (not related to the Xbox 360 Achievement points) that the player will be able to use to unlock new abilities for Boog.</plot>

  <plot>In July 2001 it was discovered that an terrorist organization known as the &quot;The Solar Martyrs&quot;, hiding in a small country called Banhar, may have nuclear weapons at their disposal. The U.S. government decided that a large-scale attack would prove risky, and so a small group of Special Forces was formed... &quot;Only one machine is fit for such a task... In this simulator the player controls an AH-64 Apache, the &quot;primary attack helicopter in the U.S. Arsenal&quot;. It can be controlled from 5 different points of view, including 1st (inside the cockpit) and 3rd person ones. The on screen display holds valuable information to the pilot, such as damage meters, status of engines, rotor brakes, wheel brakes and hover, air speed, altitude, compass, radar, RPM, Torque, Fuel and more. The game features two control systems: arcade and physics mode. In arcade mode the helicopter maintains altitude while flying forward, while the physics mode is based on real world physics, thus, when the helicopter is moving forward, it will also lose altitude if the motor power isn&apos;t increased. The helicopter can be controlled either with a keyboard/mouse combo or with a joystick. The AH-64 comes equipped with 3 different types of weapons: Hellfire Missiles, m230 Chain Gun 30mm Automatic Cannon and Hydra Rockets. There is also a fourth kind of weapon, the Zuni Rockets, only available later in the game. Hellfire missiles are target lockable and the Cannon can be aimed with the mouse. There are 30 unique missions in this game; in most of them the player must accomplish several objectives, usually destroying enemy buildings and vehicles. The game can be saved at the end of each mission, but not during them. If the player gets killed during a mission, he must start it all over again, but the number of tries is unlimited.</plot>

  <plot>Apache Longbow Assault is a helicopter simulator for the AH-64 Apache Longbow variant and the follow-up to AH-64 Apache Air Assault. Similar to the previous game it is a mix of a simulation and arcade so players can start right away. The in-game cockpit then serves largely as a reference frame rather than complex manipulation by the player. The only game mode is a linear campaign that consists of about 30 missions. They take place during different times of day, weather and over varied terrain, including mountains, beaches and seas. It features head-to-head fights with other helicopters, attacking AA batteries, ships and ground vehicles, rescue operations and defense missions. Before starting the mission, a loadout can be defined as it is possible to run out of ammo. Weapons include Hydra rockets, Hellfire missiles and a M230 cannon. Optionally automatic targeting can be enabled. There is a night vision view and flares can be launched to assist the ground operations.</plot>

  <plot>Sometime in the 1960s, Cate Archer is the only female agent in the service of U.N.I.T.Y., a worldwide secret agency. Having been relegated to menial tasks over the years, Archer is finally given a chance to prove herself when a terrorist organization called H.A.R.M. starts to knock off active field agents. Under the qualification of &quot;being available&quot; as a trained agent, Cate is finally given the authority to track down and investigate these H.A.R.M. activities. In missions around the globe, Agent Archer will find herself sniping assassins, stealing documents, and doing a host of other suitably sneaky, but often deadly espionage tasks.&amp;#xA;No Ones Lives Forever is a 1st person shooter/sneaker that focuses on remaining undetected and obtaining intelligence data. Combining elements of James Bond (including Rare&apos;s Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark), Thief and Deus Ex, Cate will need use her weaponry and gadgets to get the drop on enemy agents. Among the gadgets available are photographic sunglasses, a lockpicking barrette, Body Remover (tm) powder, a cigarette lighter which can be used for wielding, lipstick explosives and a robotic poodle (for distracting guard dogs).&amp;#xA;Emphasizing sneakiness, the game not only gives extra points for not being seen, but also pulls tricks like alarms that cannot be shut off and guards that don&apos;t return to their docile ways once alerted to your presence. The AI does interesting things, such as knocking tables over and ducking for cover. But, at least on the lower difficulty levels, the game is willing to play with your aggressions and those who prefer shooting first and asking questions later can often gleefully blaze through the levels like a continuous action scene from a Bond flick. However while the mission will get completed, Agent Archer will relieve a lower score for taking the non-subtle approach.&amp;#xA;The game has the feel of the 1960&apos;s all over it and it shows through the artwork and the music, which are both very much in character with the period, from the loud outfits to the beatnik rythmn in the bars. In a homage to the old 60&apos;s spy movies and series, there are plenty of surprises, shootouts, close calls, memorable villains, and over-the-top action scenes.</plot>

  <plot>Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is the game based on the hit Japanese anime Sorcerous Stabber Orphen, (released outside of Japan as just Orphen). Orphen, his apprentice Majik, traveling partner Cleo and her pet dog/magical-wolf Leki, and the two mischievous trolls Volkan and Dorton, sail to the mysterious Chaos Island in search of wealth and riches. Also on the voyage are three strangers whose destinies pull Orphen and his companions into their mysterious journey. Only the powerful dark sorcerer Orphen, (in his trademark bemused manner), can discover what connections there are between the three strangers and the powers that rule the island, and keep himself and his companions alive long enough to find a way off of the ephemeral Chaos Island.&amp;#xA;Orphen: Scion of Sorcerery is a mix between adventure and some light RPG elements. Orphen is a dark sorcerer and attacks his enemies with various spells including a magical sword and elementals. The game is played in the third person perspective looking over Orphen&apos;s shoulder. You will run, jump, and explore your way through large levels on Chaos Island in varying environments; engage in boss battles that require you to use some puzzle solving and timing skills; and level up your dark magic. Once beaten, the game encourages replay by following branching story lines not taken in the previous play-through. The game maintains the feeling of the anime, particularly in the character designs and bantering dialogue. Orphen: Scion of Sorcery is entirely voice acted.</plot>

  <plot>The fourth installment in Koei&apos;s P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2. There are two levels of play: global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale.&amp;#xA;The campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or December 1941. If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to build units or develop technologies. Players can also concoct &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios by changing which countries belong to which powers: for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge.&amp;#xA;The world map used in the turn-based grand strategy side of the game is broken down into territories connected in a web of lines indicating where fleets may pass from territory to territory. Game turns on this scale represent one month, and the time it takes a fleet to move from one territory to another correlates loosely to the length of the line connecting them.&amp;#xA;Players collect resources from the territories they control every turn. Resources include money, iron ore, aluminum, and oil. Money is used for construction of new units and facilities and to speed scientific development, iron is used in construction of ships, aluminum is used in construction of aircraft, and oil is consumed when fleets move.&amp;#xA;Technological advances are not purchased; instead players direct their scientists to focus on particular developmental paths, and breakthroughs come semi-randomly. The longer the scientists have been working on a particular problem, the more likely a breakthrough becomes. Giving the scientists extra money accelerates this process. In addition to the ship and aircraft types that become available automatically with scientific advancements, players can design their own custom types using whatever technology is available to them at the time.&amp;#xA;Players decide which types of ships and aircraft to build and how many. Ships are formed into fleets that can be moved about the world map while aircraft can be assigned to defend land-based airfields or assigned to fleets with ships capable of carrying aircraft.&amp;#xA;When two hostile fleets meet in the same territory, or when a hostile fleet enters a territory defended by land-based aircraft, a battle ensues. Battles are controlled in real-time with a 3-D isometric view. Players control entire fleets, not individual ships. Orders include sending a fleet to a particular point, ordering a fleet to attack a particular other fleet or airfield, and launching and recovering aircraft for CAP or to attack a particular fleet or airfield.&amp;#xA;Players can assign the computer to control as much or as little of strategy as desired. A player who enjoys the turn-based grand strategy but not the real-time battles can have the computer automatically resolve individual battles. Conversely, a player who enjoys the real time battles but not resource management can assign various aspects of resource management to the computer so that the player only has to decide where to move fleets. At the extreme, a player could even assign fleet movement to the computer and focus entirely on real-time combat. The game also offers a scenario mode that skips grand strategy entirely and throws the player into an individual battle.</plot>

With this arsenal you now have to complete different objectives (which can change throughout the mission) inside the missions like blowing up a fuel depot. In this process you also destroy and blow up many other things in the almost completely destroyable environment (from trees to houses) and of course you&apos;ve to fight against enemy infantry and tanks. The game also gives you command over a squad of friendly tanks which you can give simple but effective commands like &apos;make a flank attack on that position&apos; or &apos;go and repair yourself at this repairstation&apos;.

You have a choice of three different models to take photographs of: Riho (a sporty girl), Lena (a supermodel), and Nano (an Internet idol).&amp;#xA;Initially, you have a basic camera, but as you take better photographs, you can earn more money to upgrade its functionality. New lenses, such as telephoto and wide angle lenses can be used, and a tripod can be purchased to stop your shaky hands.&amp;#xA;To get models to perform poses for you and to look at you, you can also perform an &quot;appeal&quot;. You can dance, jump, call out, or wave your hands - each appeal has a different mini-game associated with it. If you perform the same appeal multiple times in a row, your subject will lose interest, so it&apos;s important to vary your actions. The more success you have with appeals, the more interesting and unique poses you can get your model to perform (which are worth more points in the photo shoot).</plot>

  <plot>Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona&apos;s guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.&amp;#xA;The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it&apos;s abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.&amp;#xA;The games story takes place in 20 episodes. Each episode features a unique goal to be completed before moving on. Between episodes you can visit your home on Phantom Island; here you can summon additional phantoms to join your party. Initially only a few types of phantoms can be summoned, but more become available as experience is gained. You may also replay already completed episodes or enter a random dungeon in order to level up your party and earn additional money to buy items.</plot>

Each character is voiced by the original actors from the movie. This is a single player adventure game with action elements.&amp;#xA;In the Hundred-Acre-Wood, Pooh, Eeyore, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger are going about their normal activities when Piglet sees a scary Granosorus, which disappears before anyone else can see it. When Piglet tries to warn his friends, they don&apos;t believe him. Christopher Robin tells Piglet to overcome his fears, but Piglet thinks that he will never be big and brave enough. As his friends start to fall asleep, Piglet leaves the woods and finds a magical telescope which allows him to jump into the dreams his friends are having during their naps.&amp;#xA;In each of the 6 dream &quot;levels&quot;, Piglet must help his friends with problems and puzzles. For example, help Pooh find honey or Tigger find his stripes. Each dreamworld is also dangerous with menacing Heffalumps and Woozles, among other scary monsters. Piglet must defeat these monsters with a tactic he knows well - making scary faces. Some monsters aren&apos;t frightened enough, though, so use cookies (hidden in the scenery) to buy some scarier ones at the Brave Face Factory. Find and use Christopher Robin&apos;s balloon which gives Piglet a morale boost and a burst of speed. Depending upon the scenario, three characters can be controlled: Piglet, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh.&amp;#xA;After the 6 nightmare levels are solved, Piglet will face the real Granosorus from the beginning of the game and become a hero by rescuing his friends.</plot>

This game is about one of those men, trying to get to safety of Switzerland through hostile territory.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is mostly about sneaking around varied environments such as a lumberyard, wilderness and so forth trying not to be detected by the German troops and making as little commotion as possible. With the aid of different objects (such as cigarette packs for distracting guards or apples for a quick stamina replenishing) the player must make it through the levels. The player character has a stamina which means that it&apos;s not very good idea to be standing in a freezing cold water for too long because if the stamina meter runs out, the health meter starts to deplete. Because of it, it&apos;s a good idea to warm up by campfires or eat something once in a while, thus restoring stamina.&amp;#xA;Of course there is some weapons also, which one can use to dispatch enemies that wander too close. They range from a piano string to machine pistols.</plot>

  <plot>Premier Manager 08 is a soccer manager where the player is responsibly for the athletic and financial success of his team. As usual there are a lot of details to take care of, e.g. searching for sponsors, stadium expansion, player transfers, lineup and tactics. But, as usual for English soccer managers, the emphasis is on the athletic aspect.&amp;#xA;The player character earns experience depending on his successes and unlocks new abilities with it, e.g. to construct a certain building. The same goes for the staff members. The second innovation is a new bar where the player has quick access to his staff members who keep him up to date - this replaces the usual news systems. The matches itself use an abstract presentation: The soccer field is shown in a top-down, tactical perspective and the player movements are shown with blue and yellow balls. The game features about 400 teams in six leagues.</plot>

  <plot>The story of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time starts with the Prince and his father, the King of Persia, besieging the Maharajah&apos;s castle to plunder the treasures hidden inside. In order to impress his father, the Prince sneaks inside to recover the magical Dagger of Time. He quickly learns that this dagger has the ability to control time. The malevolent Vizier has other plans for the dagger, however, and tricks the Prince into unlocking a mysterious secret of the Dagger that causes the King and many of his subjects to be turned into sand zombies. Now, the Prince must figure out what has happened and try to set things right again.&amp;#xA;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action adventure game that updates many of the gameplay concepts from the original two games and brings them into a fully 3-dimensional world. The Prince will engage in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more in his quest. The Prince also carries the Dagger of Time, which allows him to unleash several magical powers. The most important of these powers is the ability to reverse time. This ability allows the player to reverse their actions when they lead the Prince to his death.</plot>

  <plot>After many dangerous adventures, the Prince finally makes his way home to Babylon, bringing with him his new bride Kaileena, the Empress of Time. Their hopes for a peaceful and happy future together are dashed, however, when they arrive in Persia to find the land ravaged by war. Kaileena is promptly captured and murdered by the evil Vizier, and her death unleashes the Sands of Time, from which the Vizier derives terrifying new powers.&amp;#xA;Once again the Prince of Persia must stand to fight, but this time he will be stronger than ever, thanks to his new alter ego the Dark Prince, borne of the Prince&apos;s contact with the Sands. As he fights to reclaim his kingdom from the hands of a madman, he must also battle with his own inner demons as the Dark Prince threatens to consume him entirely.&amp;#xA;The game is very similar (in terms of fight and puzzle sequences) to the previous installments of UbiSoft&apos;s Prince of Persia trilogy: The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. There are some major innovations like the character of Dark Prince, who possess the main protagonist from time to time and offers him new combos and moves. There is also new ability, called &quot;Speed Kill&quot;, which is very effective against all opponents in the game (victims are attacked from behind and murdered in brutally fashion).&amp;#xA;In Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones player will explore not only the streets of Babylon, but also a ruined palace of his father, temple and the famous Hanging Gardens.</plot>

The fights are more brutal and take a larger part in the game, as the Prince now has enhanced fighting moves including new attack moves via walls and poles.&amp;#xA;Even though the fights make up a large part of the game, the puzzle sections are still present and more complicated than before. A new move in the puzzle sections of the game is the curtain slide, which allows you to slide down to the ground slowly.

  <plot>It is World War II, and the player takes the role of an American pilot, Captain Lewis Stone, who is thrown into a prison camp of the Nazis. While attempting to escape the camp, Captain Stone discovers that the Germans are developing a secret weapon they intend to use against the Allies. Soon his personal wish of escape turns into a desire to save the world from the destruction the Nazis are planning. Prisoner of War can be described as a stealth game. Unlike most other games of its kind (e.g. the Thief series), the game relies on stealth entirely, without offering violent options. The protagonist is helpless in the prison camp, and his only weapon is his wit. Sneaking past guards to deliver an important object to a fellow prisoner, hiding items, staying in shadows to avoid being recognized, and other stealth-based activities occupy the largest portion of the game. </plot>

The goal for the riders is to stay on for a full eight seconds while the bull&apos;s is to buck off the rider as fast as possible.&amp;#xA;The list of riders and bulls are:&amp;#xA;Bull Riders&amp;#xA;1. Brian Canter&amp;#xA;2. Ross Coleman&amp;#xA;3. J.W. Hart&amp;#xA;4. Mike Lee&amp;#xA;5. Guilherme Marchi&amp;#xA;6. Justin McBride&amp;#xA;7. Adriano Moraes&amp;#xA;8. Ty Murray&amp;#xA;9.

Vertical Limit&amp;#xA;23. White Magic&amp;#xA;The modes consists of a quick ride as either a rider or a bull or a tutorial that the player can learn the controls of the two. There is also an unlimited mode where players can battle a bull without the eight second rule and see how long they can stay on. There is also a season mode where the player can either use a rider or a bull in a ten city schedule (Dallas, Anaheim, Atlanta, Uncasville, Albuquerque, Tacoma, New York, New Orleans, Tulsa and Las Vegas) in an attempt to win the championship or the award for Bull of the Year with each event lasting three rounds.&amp;#xA;The controls consist of using the the Left Analog stick for the rider and the bull, either to lean in a certain direction to keep from being thrown or for the bull, to buck and spin in an attempt to throw off the rider with the Right Analog stick only used to run in any direction for the bull. The shoulder buttons are also used, the L1 and R1 is used for the rider to tighten their grip on the bull to keep from being thrown off, however these are only present in the medium and hard modes. Likewise, the L2 and R2 are used for both the bull and rider and for their signature modes. The X button is also used for the rider to dismount the bull, hitting it again while in air to land on their feet will give the player bonus points, also the X button can also be used during the ride to spur on the bull, resulting in bonus points as well. Additionally, the bull can receive bonus points by breaking cameras and signs scattered around the side of the pen.&amp;#xA;There are two different meters with the same purpose, the rider has a health meter which can be lowered, the lower it is the more likely the player will be thrown off. Additionally, if a rider is injured in a ride, their health will be depleted slightly for the next round. A rage meter is used for the bull, the higher the meter the more likely they can buck off a rider, but the lower it is the more the rider has a chance to complete the ride.&amp;#xA;There are also power-ups that can be obtained through the season mode (however only in the medium and hard difficulty levels) that are obtained for scoring a certain sets of points for a round. For the rider a spur is obtained and can be used to slow down the bull while the bull receives a set of horns that speeds up the bull and increases the chances of throwing off a rider. These power-ups are activated by pressing and holding the Down button on the D-pad for a second.&amp;#xA;There is also multiplayer capabilities where two friends can battle head-to-head, one as the rider and the other as the bull. Players can also unlock videos of actual PBR action by completing certain objectives throughout the game.</plot>

Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 Game •Enhanced Realism: PES 2010 delivers a pace of game in tune with football played at the highest level. Triangulation of passes and use of off-the-ball runs are key to breaking down the opposition, forcing the player to use the strengths of their team mates to create scoring opportunities. Gone are &apos;soft&apos; goals that can be used to break the deadlock - instead, only working the channels and the precision play expected of great players will make a difference. •Player Characteristics: Key skills of the many players have now been attributed named, allowing users to incorporate them into their play strategy. Cover star Torres, for instance, is renowned for his ability to receive a pass in the penalty area, and to drop the ball to a teammate in a good position for a goal-scoring opportunity. As such, he is labeled a &quot;Fox In The Box&quot; and &quot;Goal Poacher&quot;, in line with his prowess in both scoring and setting up goals. •Instant Tactical Switching: Each team has unique settings matching their real-life playing styles. Torres at Liverpool, for instance, will recreate the Merseyside club&apos;s sophisticated play and high numbers in attack, their pressing from midfield, strong defensive line, and width across the pitch. For the offense, the default settings support wide attacks and the aim to move in the back of the opponent&apos;s defense line. The user can summon the bar instantly during a match to adjust team tactics to enhance their defence or strengthen attacks. •Master League: The Master League now incorporates &quot;</plot>

  <plot>Total Control: PES Productions has enhanced the 360-degree passing ratio, offering unprecedented levels of control over every pass, shot, throw-in, through ball and lofted through balls. This allows users to pass the ball into space, and move their play with total freedom. Players must precisely weight their passes and second-guess the runs of their team-mates and exploit their movement. Players even can apply pressure on opponents to force them off the ball. •Shot &amp; Stamina Gauge: In addition to the generic power gauge, the Shot &amp; Stamina meter details the player&apos;s exact level of fitness. Constantly sprinting will affect the player&apos;s movements and will have an adverse affect on his stats, with passes going awry and a loss of pace. •New Defender AI: Defenders now hold their positions naturally, no longer chasing any ball that enters their area - preferring to close down the attacker and force them into a mistake. •Animation and Player Physics: PES Productions has totally reworked every element of in-game animation. These additions will become clear before even kick-off, with the players enjoying fluid, natural movements, with more realistic acceleration and inertia than ever before. The physicality between players is also improved, which was a priority requested in PES forums. Jostling and blocking now looks stunning, while there is a larger variety of convincing tackling styles. Ambient animation also adds immensely to the in-game atmosphere, as players behave realistically when off the ball, and walk and run with a variety of individual styles. •Speed of Play: The new level of control means that PES 2011 enjoys a more considered pace of play, which varies dependent on situations. The game will burst into life as counter-attacks come into play, but players can dictate the pace via slow build up or exploiting available space to surge forward. It is harder to make long </plot>

  <plot>PES 2012 continues KONAMI&apos;s determination to listen to its fanbase and make key improvements to the aspects the audience demands. Thus, the focus for PES 2012 is to ensure the highest level of playability, challenge and realism for the game, whilst also improving the level of control offered to users. Fundamental changes to all areas of its AI have been made following user feedback. Similarly, teamwork is central to how the game moves and feels, enabling fans to replicate anything they would see in a real match.Active AI: PES 2012 strives to recreate the movement and team ethic of real football, and Active AI plays a vital role in this. Players will no longer flock to a ball, but will make intelligent runs to create space and draw markers, while others will make themselves available, instigate runs, and visibly call for the ball. In the box, support players will make diagonal decoy runs, full backs will overlap on the wings and midfielders will provide support from behind the ball. The new Active AI routines ensure the flow of a match is more natural, with specific routines for both attack and defence. Hold-up play implemented last year has been improved for easier control with more effectiveness. Defending as a unit plays a key role, and players now hold a tight line, check on the distance between each other, track back as a unit, and fill in for each other. As individuals they also make better decisions to close space, block and tackle. Jostling: Physicality is a key component in PES 2012, with player strength one of their key individual attributes, and having a vital effect on how they can use their strength to win the ball in a one-on-one situation. Players now fall depending on how they are challenged, with more realistic animations used to show the challenges between two jostling players. Graphics: Several aspects of the game have enjoyed a huge overhaul. Player facial expression is now much richer and the lighting effects are more natural, while new cameras show off the huge variety of pitch-side movement, with more detail on and around the game than ever before. Off The Ball Control: Equally key to opening up PES 2012 is the ability to highlight any player at any time. A new system has been implemented, allowing users to switch players with ease. In defence, the right stick is now used to select any outfield player, while set pieces are also enhanced through its use. Goal kicks, corners, free kicks and throw-ins now let the user quickly take control of any player off the ball, enabling clever runs which create space for an attack. Referee AI: Referees are also crucial to general game flow and their AI has been greatly enhanced to ensure fewer interruptions to play. Decisions are improved, and advantage is played much more regularly in offside and free kick scenarios. As such, refs will only intervene when truly necessary, but they will show cards if necessary once play has broken down. Pass Support: Accessed through the new personal player settings, Pass Support allows users to determine the level of AI assistance when passing the ball. Players can opt for one of five settings from full support, right up to full veteran setting which switches off all assistance so that the direction, weight and speed of every pass is at their disposal </plot>

  <plot>Working from the ground up, PES Productions have strived to rework every element of play, creating a fresh and energetic new standard for football titles. In addition to noticeably improved graphics and seamless animation, the thrust of the new system&apos;s power has been used to redefine the way football is played on a home system. Gone are the limitations imposed by dated animation systems and AI elements, and instead PES 2014 boasts a central core that perfectly mimics the skill and awareness that elevates the world&apos;s greatest players above their peers.;Six central tenets combine to establish PES 2014 as a new benchmark in football simulations, governing everything from the way the player receives and controls the ball, the physicality of play, and the &apos;feel&apos; of match-day: the rush and euphoria or crushing lows that experiencing an important games can bring. As such, the key pillars on which PES 2014 is based are:;True B all Tech: For the first time in a football simulation, PES 2014 centres everything on the ball: how it moves, and how players use it. First touch and sublime control are what set certain players apart from others. The ability to not only read a pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on an encroaching defender. TrueBall Tech allows the player to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed barycentric physics determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the pass, as to how the player&apos;s body will automatically shape to receive it.;Thus, the player has total control in determining how their body is angled to receive a pass, whereas previous football titles present the user with scant options. Instead, TrueBall Tech means that it can be chested or nodded past an opponent, flicked into space or to a team mate, while closer dribbling control is a much more personal attribute in the new game. </plot>

  <plot>ProStroke Golf: World Tour 2007 is a golf simulation which unique feature is the innovative control scheme. In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement.&amp;#xA;This only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.&amp;#xA;Less innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.&amp;#xA;The game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.</plot>

Unfortunately an epidemic infests all kingdoms except the one inhabited by the unicorns. Of course this leads to accusations and the unicorn Pryzm is sent out to end the plague - she is accompanied by the troll magician Karrock who distrusts her. The player takes control over both of them at the same time: the left analogue stick controls the unicorn and the right one the troll.&amp;#xA;The basic gameplay is simple: the player rides through the 16 levels and battles infected flora and fauna. After defeat they transform back to their real selves - if the whole level (including the periodic mini bosses) is rescued the player can proceed to the next one. The roles of the heroes are evenly divided: Pryzm is used for moving at different speeds, jumping and defensive spells, e.g. stun. Karrock on the other hand uses offensive spells and his magic wand to hit the enemies nearby. The game can be played in first or third person perspective.</plot>

The game doesn&apos;t feature much in the way of power-ups or upgradeable weapons, but instead features the unique &quot;Buzz&quot; system, which increases your rate of fire and power in relation to horizontal rolling and movement, encouraging the player to move all over the screen.

If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends. The game has several mode to choose from: •Arcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an &quot;A&quot; or an &quot;S&quot; rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode. •Home Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them. •Sudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends. •Survival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted. •Video Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode.

  <plot>As a citizen of the kingdom of Bartonia, it&apos;s your job to discover why the Undead have begun swarming all over the world of Etheria. In this RPG hybrid you&apos;ll be following the story of your character as they rid Etheria of the Undead scourge and save Bartonia, complete sidequests for extra money, experience, items and companions, craft your own weapons and armor, capture monsters for use as mounts or to learn their spells, and even lay siege to neighboring kingdoms in order to add them to your own empire. However, Puzzle Quest is an RPG with a twist. Everything is done (as the name implies) with puzzles.&amp;#xA;Everything in Puzzle Quest is done with puzzles. The puzzles themselves are similar to Bejeweled in execution, with a few slight variations used for things like item crafting and enemy capture.&amp;#xA;When fighting an enemy (which can range from zombies to orcs and even castle strongholds, each with their own special spells and abilities), you both take turns using the same board. The goal is to reduce your opponents hitpoints to zero, which can be done directly by linking up skulls in rows of three or more, or by using spells which require mana. To build up mana, just link three or more runes of the same color together, just like the skulls. Every time you gain mana, it&apos;s stored in your reserves until you use it (or are hit with a mana draining attack). Gold and experience are built up in the same way, using gold coins or purple experience orbs that occupy the same board and can be linked just like runes and skulls.&amp;#xA;The real strategy behind the game comes into play when you factor in elemental mastery (gaining extra mana when linking runes for a specific element), equipment (which can prevent damage, drain mana and more), spells (which can poison, drain mana, stun and so on) and linking up groups of four or more. The reason groups of four are important is that every time a row of four-of-a-kind is created, you get an extra turn. While it doesn&apos;t sound important, getting four runes in a row could possibly give you enough mana to cast an extremely powerful spell and give you the extra turn to cast it before your enemy can even move.&amp;#xA;There is also a direct action mode in which players can hone their skills against various opponents independent from the story mode, as well as wireless multi-card play where two players can square off using their own characters from the campaign mode.</plot>

  <plot>Young Jack Russell wants to follow in the footsteps of his father, a renowned member of the Royal Radiata Knights who protect the kingdom. Unfortunately, Jack is more than a little in need of some refining. He&apos;s a bad boy with a sharp tongue and a penchant for kicking objects and even people around. Can a world-saving quest help this obnoxious 16-year-old grow into a respectable human being?&amp;#xA;Radiata Stories is a lighthearted and humorous fantasy role-playing game from Square Enix. You control Jack as he travels from town to town, recruiting allies and taking on menial tasks. Of course there&apos;s also a plot of saving the kingdom from certain doom, but there&apos;s plenty of time for exploring and meeting people before you&apos;ll need to worry about that. The game is fairly open-ended, allowing players to explore at their leisure.&amp;#xA;Unlike the usual RPG, where the NPC characters simply wait around for the player to come listen to their one sentence, everyone in Radiata Stories has their own life. People wake up, go places and do things, then go back home. Learning the characters&apos; schedules and using them to Jack&apos;s advantage is critical to a successful adventure. Sometimes they&apos;re too busy to stop and talk to you, so you have to catch them at the right time. This makes Radiata feel less like a game and more of a living, breathing world.&amp;#xA;Combat is real-time, much like Star Ocean: Till the End of Time and Namco&apos;s Tales series, but you can give general guidelines for the NPC party members on how they should operate. There&apos;s even a link system that lets you coordinate your party&apos;s strategy.&amp;#xA;There are two main story paths through the game, and after you&apos;ve completed one you get to keep all your money and skills the second time around. A minimum of two play-throughs are required to discover and recruit the game&apos;s 177 potential party members. (Shades of the Suikoden series by Konami.) Once you&apos;ve recruited people as friends, you can swap your current party members at any time, but the only character you ever control yourself is Jack: if his HP falls to 0, your adventure is over.</plot>

If you complete this challenge, your monster will receive a permanent upgrade, such as a roar attack, or a charge punch. At the tenth level of each city, players face off against a boss character, Dr. Vector - if you destroy his dangerous machines as well as levelling the city, you&apos;ll receive a bonus.&amp;#xA;A new feature of Rampage: Total Destruction is the ability to climb on the front of buildings. Instead of just climbing the sides and standing on the top of buildings, players can now smash the buildings from the front as well. However, there is an added danger to this - people now hurl objects like televisions out their windows in an attempt to try and stop you.&amp;#xA;The game also includes two previous games from the series as a bonus - the original Rampage, and Rampage World Tour.

  <plot>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a platform/adventure game in a similar vein to the 3D versions of the Rayman, Sonic, Mario, or other games. It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy.&amp;#xA;Ratchet &amp; Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game&apos;s levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a &quot;backdrop&quot;; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person.&amp;#xA;The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.</plot>

  <plot>The year is 2010. Joshua Harwell and Stephanie McMurrough got a job as waiters in the opening event of Geo City, a new underground city that marks a step forward in advanced and safe city design. Everything is going well...but then a levee breaks and the Hudson River unleashes its wrath on Geo City. Panic and chaos spreads around the place.&amp;#xA;Who will survive?&amp;#xA;Raw Danger is the spiritual successor of Disaster Report (AKA SOS: The Final Escape in Europe). In this game you must guide not only Joshua and Stephanie but also several other characters out of their pending underwater grave. Those characters include Amber Brazil, a young woman wrongly accused of murdering her brother, a cab driver, an amnesiac and a schoolgirl. By making the right choices you get to play also as Keith Helm, the hero of the previous game.&amp;#xA;The main goal of the game is getting past various obstacles and challenges while keeping your body temperature. As the temperature drops the characters&apos; movement slows down and eventually they&apos;ll collapse. You can keep warm with heat sources such as stoves, radiators and barrel fires, which are used also to save the game and cook food that charges your energy.&amp;#xA;Each character has its own type of gameplay: Joshua is strong and young and can perform physically challenging tasks, Amber has handcuffs which limit her movement and must use stealth tactics to avoid the police, and the taxi driver uses his taxi to avoid different disasters.</plot>

  <plot>Admiral Razorbeard and his gang of robot pirates have enslaved all the creatures in Rayman&apos;s world, including the peaceful Teensies and the Lums, which give life to the earth. Rayman has been captured by the pirates as well and is lamenting his troubles in his prison cell, when he meets his good friend, Globox. Globox has smuggled in a silver Lum, given to him by the great fairy, Ly. With the power of the silver Lum, Rayman is able to once more shoot his fists. With his power restored, the pair escape the flying prison ship and embark on another adventure to save the entire world! Rayman 2: The Great Escape is the sequel to Rayman, a 2D side-scrolling platform game. Unlike the previous game, Rayman 2 is entirely in free-roaming 3D environments, similar to Super Mario 64. Rayman has many unique abilities that can help him get around the world. In addition to being able to shoot his fists, he can use his hair to hover like a helicopter, and even glide on air currents in certain places. He can climb certain walls and ceilings and can even use his fists to swing from special purple Lums which are shaped like rings. Rayman also has many unique items at his disposal, such as powder kegs which can be carried or fly like jets, strange warheads with legs that he can ride and steer like bucking mules, and gigantic plums that can be thrown into the water to create new paths. Rayman&apos;s goal is to find the four masks of the world, which allow the owner to reawaken Polokus, the spirit of the world. These masks are scattered far and wide, and are well hidden and guarded, so it is not an easy task. By gathering the yellow Lums, Rayman will gain access to new worlds, which will take him to the locations of new masks. Collecting yellow Lums also rewards him with new powers and life meter extensions.</plot>

  <plot>Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world into a deadly possibility. By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It&apos;s up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox.&amp;#xA;Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman&apos;s main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; button.&amp;#xA;The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment.&amp;#xA;Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level.&amp;#xA;Rayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman&apos;s health bar.&amp;#xA;There are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games.&amp;#xA;The Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.</plot>

At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in more a lesser protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into: hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines. In order to survive, Parker must link up and aid his fellow miners, receiving direction and objectives via com-link messages.&amp;#xA;Red Faction features an game engine called Geo-Mod. It allows holes to be blasted into all manner of terrain including floors, walls and ceilings. While limited to certain surfaces, such as rock, ice and concrete, this nonetheless results in a more destructible environment where deviation from the level design is encouraged. Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths, tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.</plot>

  <plot>Long since the revolt from the mining of Mars, a new group has taken over Red Faction, and their sights are set on the dictator, Chancellor Sopot. Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed.&amp;#xA;As the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you.&amp;#xA;As was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks.&amp;#xA;Multiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.</plot>

  <plot>The game is set in medieval Japan, at the time of &quot;warring states&quot;. Shingen Takeda and Nobunaga Oda clans are fighting each other, trying to gain supremacy over the entire Japan. The heroine of the game is a young girl called Kurenai (&quot;crimson&quot;), the daughter of a prominent Japanese engineer whose new invention (apparently, a destructive weapon) has drawn the attention of the warring clans. Ninjas sent by Nobunaga Oda attack his workshop, kill him, and leave Kurenai hanging from a tree tied by tetsugen, a piece of wire used by ninjas as a weapon. But a kind woman saves Kurenai, and trains her to be a ninja herself. This is where her quest for revenge begins.&amp;#xA;&quot;Red Ninja&quot; is an action game with stealth elements. The primary weapon Kurenai uses is the deadly tetsugen. During the game you&apos;ll learn to perform new moves with this weapon. You can also use other weapons, such as a blowgun and throwing knives. Kurenai can jump, hang from ledges, and roll. There is a fair amount of platform-like sequences where she will have to demonstrate her acrobatic ninja technique. An effective way to kill enemies is to use stealth. Kurenai can approach enemies silently and hide behind objects. She can also &quot;seduce&quot; enemies, by talking to them in a sexy way and luring them to their death - a move that doesn&apos;t always work.</plot>

  <plot>This game, based on the famous Quentin Tarantino movie Reservoir Dogs, fills in the gaps in the movie that are only briefly mentioned (like the robbery at the jewelry store). Throughout the story you get to play all seven main characters, from Mr. Blonde to Mr. White.&amp;#xA;The missions are introduced by game engine cutscenes, which often recreate moments from the film. For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue &quot;I don&apos;t think we got set up, I know we got set up!&quot; and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive.&amp;#xA;To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.</plot>

  <plot>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president&apos;s daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president&apos;s daughter.&amp;#xA;Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new &quot;behind the back&quot; movement camera angle and an &quot;over the shoulder&quot; aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game.&amp;#xA;The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous &quot;merchant&quot; to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG.&amp;#xA;The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2&apos;s game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</plot>

In this case however, the game can be played either with the Guncon 2 lightgun or with the standard controller as a first-person shooter. Players can choose either character or can play cooperatively as both.&amp;#xA;As in most lightgun games, the object is to make it through an environment while shooting enemies. It is somewhat less typical in that you have full roaming control over your character rather than being stuck on rails. More unusually, a timer begins as you enter each area. If the timer runs out before you leave, Nemesis will appear and chase you.</plot>

The end of the war has had Japan divided between the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it&apos;s halves for four years. Dubbed the &quot;Japan War&quot;, it further weakened Japan&apos;s economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As Masami&apos;s team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into all-out war.&amp;#xA;Ring of Red is a turn-based action/strategy game set in an alternative post-World War II Japan. Players take the role of members of the South Japan military who are put on a hunt for a stolen AFW. During battles, mechs are moved into position on a grid-based map and may engage different enemy units or occupy specific points. As turns are taken, time passes, shifting the battlefield through daytime and nighttime hours as well as different weather effects. All of these affect the accuracy of weapons as well as the types of abilities that can be used. Battles end when objectives are met by either side.&amp;#xA;Putting a twist on the turn-based genre, Ring of Red features turn-based movements with real-time combat. When two AFWs engage on the battle grid, players are taken to a real-time battle where they have limited time to engage one another before refueling is required. Here the AFW is viewed from 3rd person and may be moved forward and back and given orders. Firing on the enemy requires aiming, in first person, by the player. The AFW uses a steam powered cannon which must be pressurized before firing, aiming at either an enemy AFW or at enemy support crew. Additionally AFWs can engage in close combat if they are close enough, delivering punches to one another. Each AFW pilot also has his own statistics and own special abilities, that can be used only once per battle, that can be called upon at any time. AFWs also feature unique statistics, being divided into four types: Standard, Light, 4-Leg (Heavy) and Anti-AFW.&amp;#xA;Each AFW unit is actually a group made up of three ground units: one of which acts as crew for the AFW, while the other two walk alongside. Support units are divided into types including: Infantry, Shooter, Supply, Medical, Mechanic and Recon. Each of these types of &quot;support units&quot; has different skills in battle and individually have different abilities and statistics. The abilities available and used change depending on which positions the units are assigned to. Additionally many special abilities need to &quot;charge&quot; in the rear ranks before becoming available for usage. These abilities include firing special types of munitions (including flash, heat, smoke and impact), laying down mines or tripwire, laying down a barrage of fire, throwing grenades, healing units, sniping specific targets, morale boosts, AFW repairs, neutralization of enemy effects and disarming enemy mines/tripwire.</plot>

After a bite, you enter a real-time fishing simulation sequence, where you can visibly see the fish underwater. You then have to lure the fish in while making sure your fishing line doesn&apos;t break.

  <plot>A complete remake of the classic 1986 title Defender of the Crown (not to be confused with the &quot;Remastered&quot; Windows version released in 2002), in Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.&amp;#xA;Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John&apos;s stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard&apos;s ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.&amp;#xA;As with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take: conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John&apos;s army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian&apos;s contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played:&amp;#xA;The first mini-game that appears is the archery raid; in this mode, the player sees the action directly from Robin Hood&apos;s eyes while he lurks on a tree, the goal being to use Robin&apos;s trustworthy bow and arrow to hit cavalry guards and the convoy as they pass by his spot. As some guards are also armed with a bow, Robin can also hide behind the log for cover.&amp;#xA;If the player attacks a guarded territory, the game enters a strategic mode where the battle takes place on a three-lane field, and the goal is to vanquish the enemy defenses of force him to flee by launching direct attacks on each lane.&amp;#xA;Sword fighting pits the player against one or more opponents, depending on the setting. The goal is simple: slash everyone by throwing blows and dodge/parry the opponents&apos; own. During raids there is also a timer that represents the time before sunrise - failing to escape before that or being killed results on Robin&apos;s imprisonment.&amp;#xA;Battles are done on a real-time fashion, where both armies are placed on the far-sides of a multi-lane battlefield. The player chooses which lane to attack (or defend) and if successful, the opponent will lose enough units to flee or simply wait for their deaths.&amp;#xA;Jousting in a tournament allows the player to fight for fame, and then for gold and land. To do so, after picking an opponent, he starts by building enough speed, and then slam the spear into the opponent, the goal being to knock him from his horse.&amp;#xA;Some shires are protected by castles, and to conquer them, first a siege must be laid in. This requires the player to load up on catapults and then destroy each wall of the fortification by throwing boulders at it. Each wall represents a part of the defending army: the most damage done, the easier it becomes to invade it.</plot>

  <plot>Robocop places you in the titanium-coated-with-kevlar boots of Alex Murphy, killed in the line of duty and resurrected as the cyborg officer Robocop. The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug &quot;Brain Drain,&quot; and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP&apos;s role in all this is almost certain, but unclear.&amp;#xA;Robocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons.&amp;#xA;Objectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy&apos;s pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop&apos;s ethics and &quot;prime directives.</plot>

  <plot>Robot Warlords is a one or two player, turn based, strategy game featuring battling robots in real Tokyo settings. The background story, which is a single player game, is one of political unrest and intrigue, at least that&apos;s what it says in the game description. The Japanese army is attempting a military takeover, groups of them have declared martial law and are riding around in robots called Bullets to enforce it. The government doesn&apos;t want to launch an all out counter attack because that would result in massive civilian casualties. Instead they turn to Professor Matsuzakai who developed the Bullet machines and a handful of people at the Odaiba Bullet repair site. With major Kazuma Saeki in charge Operation Velvet is launched, with only four operational experimental machines at their disposal they must stop the rebellion in seven days otherwise an all out attack will be launched against the rebel forces in Tokyo with corresponding catastrophic loss of life and massive damage. The game starts with a long conversation between the chief cabinet secretary, the head of the army and the Japanese Prime minister, This sets the scene and introduces all the characters. When this is over the player starts on their first mission. Prior to a mission each of the Bullets can be customised, this includes naming and changing the colour of each machine, assigning weapons to each arm and shoulder, and upgrading body parts. The player also has a number of TP or Technique points which they can use to install battle manoeuvres such as the &apos;Preparation For Combat&apos; technique which costs three TP and decreases the enemy weapon hit ratio by -20 and the player&apos;s hit ratio by -10. Only six techniques can be installed at a time. The game consists of eleven missions spread over a seven day period and each mission is turn based. In each turn the player selects whether they wish to move a Bullet in normal mode, just a few adjacent cells, or turbo mode in which they can travel further. While moving they may optionally employ one of the deployed combat techniques. Once the player has set their Bullet&apos;s destination they may choose whether or not to attack their opponents, in an attack multiple opponents can be selected. While various battle techniques used by the players and their opponents affect the hit ratio and consequently the damage caused by an attack, other game elements also do this. When firing through obstacles such as cars the hit ratio is halved, if the line of fire passes through two cars it is halved again and nothing gets through three cars. There are also special cells known as obstruction squares which halve the hit rate of any firing line that passes through them. </plot>

In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.</plot>

  <plot>Rock Band, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).&amp;#xA;The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band&apos;s score multiplier.&amp;#xA;Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band&apos;s overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.&amp;#xA;In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels.&amp;#xA;Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.&amp;#xA;The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.</plot>

  <plot>Rock Band 2 is the sequel to the 2007 musical simulation game Rock Band and offers similar gameplay. Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.&amp;#xA;The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.&amp;#xA;The original game&apos;s Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.&amp;#xA;The in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first Rock Band (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two track packs.</plot>

  <plot>Rogue Galaxy is the North American and European localized version of Rogue Galaxy (2005), only released in Japan at the time. Instead of only localizing the game, developer Level-5 Inc. spent 2 years to improve the game and add new features and content. This version was also re-released in Japan as Rogue Galaxy (Director&apos;s Cut).&amp;#xA;The original single-layer DVD was replaced by dual-layer and the doubled amount of space was used for smoother, better-looking graphics and additional data. Aside from the 4 existing planets, a fifth one, Alistia, was added. It is not part of the main story, but deepens the storyline and has new quests and items. A key to access the new world can be found in chapter 8. The existing Insectron Tournament sidequest has been expanded with two species of Insectrons, each with 8 types of Insectrons per species. The level design of Rosencaster Prison, the Gladius Towers, the Daytron factory, Rosa&apos;s desert town, and Rosa&apos;s Labyrinth has also been altered.&amp;#xA;Over 2,000 lines of additional voice dialogue were added, the battle animations were reworked, damaging enemies has become easier (attack formula revision) and Toady&apos;s analysis of weapons has also been simplified.&amp;#xA;Other gameplay improvements include the introduction of collectible Burning Chips, which power the Burning Strike attack, more items overall, two new weapons for each character (except Jaster), with 140 weapons in total, and 5 bonus costumes for each character (6 for Kisala and Simon).</plot>

Now you are seeking revenge on Omega 19, the terrorist group which you suspect is responsible for your family&apos;s death. There are eight missions to complete which have a combination of action and puzzle solving elements. You will often need to use stealth to be successful, making sure you quietly infiltrate an area without being seen, or if you are seen making sure no one sounds an alarm! You can hide in the shadows, in crates and vents, hang from the ceiling, and sneak up on guards to kill them before they see you. Of course, when action is required, there are a wide variety of weapons that will be used throughout the game; some weapons you&apos;ll come across are a pistol, a rifle, a crossbow, grenades, proximity mines, and more.

  <plot>A planned attack on Nu Earth goes wrong when a General turns traitor resulting in the massacre of Rogue&apos;s comrades.&amp;#xA;The game starts with Rogue and his comrades launched from a drop-ship. They come under fire from the Norts due to the information that had been leaked by the General. Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue&apos;s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue&apos;s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue&apos;s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas.&amp;#xA;Rogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy. Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him.&amp;#xA;The game is identical across all platforms allowing the user to create numerous profiles and using a checkpoint save feature ensuring that you don&apos;t have to go too far back in the level if you get Rogue killed. There are 3 different skill levels (Normal, Hard and Massacre) which when completed will unlock cheats.&amp;#xA;The Windows version uses a combination of keyboard (reconfigurable) and mouse, the mouse being essential for aiming and firing.&amp;#xA;The Xbox and PS2 versions are identical using the left thumb-stick for movement and the right thumb-stick for aiming and right trigger / shoulder button for firing with the other buttons used for various other actions such as weapon changing or grenade throwing.&amp;#xA;Within each platform, multiplayer is available with the option to play as Rogue, Helm, Gunnar and Bagman, each character having their own attributes. There are 5 arenas of either Stronghold or Progressive. Each map will have an objective such as defending for a certain amount of time against waves of Norts on Stronghold or getting to an objective point on Progressive maps. High scores will be saved with the user&apos;s profile.</plot>

  <plot>By combining a Roland Garros license with their tried and tested tennis engine, Namco brings a third Smash Court Tennis title for the PlayStation 2. It was released exclusively in Europe, and was based on Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2.&amp;#xA;In gameplay, the game isn&apos;t much different from other tennis games in the market, but it differs from games such as Virtua Tennis by having some emphasis on stamina (some players get tired faster than others, and not only run slower but also lose power to return the ball on longer matches) and by forcing the player to hit the ball as well-timed as possible - a &quot;nice&quot; ball (with a yellow visual cue near the racquet) will be much harder to return, as it will bounce away faster from the player.&amp;#xA;Featuring 15 real players from both ATP and WTA, the game features several game modes: Roland Garros allows the player to compete in the namesake, exhibition, and spectator, where the player can just sit back and see a game played by the computer, choosing one of the many cameras available, including the classic TV presentation or from the main stand.&amp;#xA;The beefier mode is the ProTour, where the player creates and customizes his own player, from appearance to playing style, and start a career, taking part in tournaments and completing training sessions in order to improve the player, so he or she can break into the elite. Challenge mode includes the training session mini-games of ProTour, as well as Bomb Tennis, a special mode where the court is filled with bombs, and as a player wins points, the opponent&apos;s side is flooded with even more. The goal is to detonate the bombs by pushing them into the flames, and forcing the opponent to get caught in one explosion. Also included is a complete training mode, which explains in detail the differences between shots and allows newcomers to adapt themselves to the gameplay style of this title.&amp;#xA;By completing certain goals, the player unlocks additional items, such as clothing, music tracks, trivia cards, player information and even secret players.</plot>

Like its predecessors, it is based on the classic novel &quot;San Guo&quot; (&quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;), written by Luo Guanzhong. The events of the novel (and the game) occur during the 3rd century AD, in the time of the Later Han Dynasty. China is split into several states, the leaders of each one trying to conquer the others and to become the sole leader of the Middle Country.&amp;#xA;The seventh game of the series offers some innovations - realistic 3D graphics, and the ability to play as any one of the main characters. The game is much more strategy-based than Kessen games, and your success depends on careful planning and training. Combat is turn-based.</plot>

  <plot>The eleventh installment of the series continues the struggles of the warlords for power of China in the late Han dynasty through 8 available scenarios. Control more than 40 cities, build structures and armies with the help of hundreds of officers and decide the fate of China, yet again.&amp;#xA;Game Perspective&amp;#xA;Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI uses the whole map of China from a side-scrolling and rotatable top-down perspective camera. All units, cities, and structures are viewable throughout the map, not requiring any form of espionage beforehand as in earlier Romance of the Three Kingdoms games. When the player(s) decides to &quot;end a turn&quot;, own and AI units will commence their actions depending on which part of the map the player is currently viewing.&amp;#xA;Officers&amp;#xA;There are over 800 officers, complete with individual portraits and biographies, also including other information such as combat skills, blood ties, and unit specialization. Additionally, completing the tutorial will unlock several officers from other periods of medieval China, such as Kong Qiu (Confucius).&amp;#xA;Officers have statistical abilities which influence how the success rate a mentioned general may carry out a specific task. The abilities are: Leadership, War, Intelligence, Politics, and Charisma. Continuously performing tasks may increase any the primary statistics. In addition to abilities, some officers may also have specific skills. Skills provide unique active or passive capabilities for the officer in mention. For example, Zhao Yun has the &quot;Insight&quot; skill which renders him immune from all enemy combat strategies.&amp;#xA;Combat&amp;#xA;Combat initiates immediately during each player turn. During the turn of any active player, the player may choose to move own units on the map and attack enemy land units or ships. All opponents may be attacked unless under alliance or cease fire, during which the player may also move through their territory freely.&amp;#xA;Technical Points&amp;#xA;Player(s) actions may reward the player with technical points. These points may then be invested in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI version of a combat technological tree, thus enabling different strengths for each faction formerly defined only by its officers.

  <plot>This is a remake of the first Romancing SaGa game.&amp;#xA;The land of Mardias has experienced 1000 years of peace after the defeat of the 3 evil gods: Death, Saruin and Schirach. The last evil god standing, Saruin, was imprisoned with the power of the 10 Fatestones - scattered across Mardias. One thousand years later since Saruin&apos;s imprisonment, eight adventurers face an unknown destiny against the silent growing evil awaiting to challenge the lands of Mardias once again...&amp;#xA;Gameplay&amp;#xA;Romancing SaGa is a 3rd perspective anime role-playing adventure game with turned-based combat. In this game, the player is 1 (one) of the possible 8 (eight) heroes/heroines available in the game.&amp;#xA;Each character has a different main storyline, however choosing either character does not effect much of the storyline, regardless. In addition to different main storylines, each character has a different starting class (optional) which may be altered throughout the game.&amp;#xA;Romancing SaGa uses a non-linear storyline. Characters may travel the land regardless of any main plot. The player&apos;s party consists of a maximum of 5 characters, of which may be added or removed throughout the game at your discretion.&amp;#xA;Gameplay of Romancing SaGa may be categorized as the following:&amp;#xA;1. Character Development and Skills&amp;#xA;Character development in Romancing SaGa is comprised of 2 different developments: The first is automatic statistic development where the characters &quot;statistically level-up&quot; per attribute (not per level) after each combat. The second is manual skill development where the player can trade in &quot;jewels&quot; to upgrade several skills of a character e.g. Longsword, Climbing, Search Chests, etc.&amp;#xA;Character levels are represented by Character Class levels. Certain skills must be upgraded for a character to fulfill the requirements of that class. Each class has different traits, for example a &quot;Swordsman&quot; gains benefits in attack mode. Character classes do not effect the storyline.&amp;#xA;Turned-based Combat&amp;#xA;Standard RPG turned based combat, where the uniqueness of the combat refers to automatic combo capabilities of your characters. Under certain situations, the player&apos;s characters may combine their attacks against an enemy (a combo) thus creating greater effects (in addition of visual effects).&amp;#xA;Characters in combat throughout the course of combat may develop special weapon skills. Weapon skills may only be attained through combat through enlightenment (Glimmer). Weapon skills use BPs (Battle Points) and (sometimes) DPs (Duration Points), each weapon skill has different BPs, which are effected by the skills of a character, e.g. a character that has a level 2 skill in Longsword uses less BPs for his/her longsword weapon skill.&amp;#xA;Another interesting feature about the weapons in regard to combat: each character may equip up to 5 weapons (optional) and may choose from those 5 different weapons at any point during combat, thus adding more tactical possibilities in combat. This reason for this may likely relate to DPs (Duration Points) of a weapon. If a DP of a weapon is used up (usually due to use of special weapon skills), the weapon breaks and is unusable during combat. It may only be repaired at a blacksmith or at an inn.&amp;#xA;Unlike other RPGs, all attributes of the characters (health, etc.) are automatically healed after combat. However, if a character falls during combat, their LPs (Life Points) decrease. If the LP decreases to zero, the character will die permanently. LPs are regained by resting at an inn.</plot>

  <plot>RTL Biathlon 2007 is a simulation of the winter biathlon sport, combining two disciplines: cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. The competition takes place on nine skiing areas. The skier moves forward by keeping a button pressed, which consumes energy. The amount of energy varies in different sections of the level (more when going downhill, less when going up), and releasing the button allows for some generation, while the skier will move slower. When overexerting the athlete, the energy levels move into orange and red, and a large amount of stamina is consumed. Other techniques include gliding (crouching when going downhill) and sprinting in certain areas. The shooting sections are shown from a first-person perspective. The accuracy depends on the remaining stamina. Players can also hold their breath to steady the rifle, but this depletes the stamina levels further.&amp;#xA;The different game modes include Practice, Career and Multiplayer. By competing in different leagues, players earn experience points that eventually open up power points to be distributed over a number of skills. At the start of the game, players can choose a preset skier or create a custom one, determining the name, outfit and skill level. Multiplayer is available for up to four players (hot seat mode) or two in split-screen.</plot>

  <plot>RTL Biathlon 2009 is a simulation of the Biathlon sport. Like the real sport it is basically divided into two sections: skiing and shooting. During the skiing sections the player steers his athlete into the correct direction and watches his stamina. In the middle of the screen is a power bar which gets filled by holding the assigned button - if the bar is too low the athlete gets slow and if it is too high he gets tired. Practically this results in steady button pressing to keep it as high as possible. During the shooting sequences the player shoots on targets while the cursor is wobbling. He can also hold his breath for a short time to steady his aim.&amp;#xA;In the career mode the player divides points into four categories, e.g. speed or stamina, which influence the athlethe&apos;s capabilities. After successful championships he can improve these stats further. New in this instalment are super-powers which can be chosen at some point. When activated these give a big boost on a stat for a short time, e.g. &quot;mountain skiing&quot; boosts power when skiing uphill. These are available once per race. There are overall 15 courses which are partly licensed.</plot>

  <plot>Following previous winter sports titles (including the official game of the Torino 2006 Olympic Games), 49Games presents another light simulation of some of the most popular winter sports, including alpine skiing, snowboard half-pipe, ski jump, speed skating, biathlon, luge, bobsleigh, skeleton, figure skating and curling, for a total of 18 different events. While not as complex as the specialized games developed by the German company (there&apos;s no waxing the skis, for instance), the game features a solid physics engine, which provides more realism than some of the more arcadish approaches to the genre. Gameplay varies by event, with the player being in full control of the athlete in most events like alpine skiing and half-pipe (which plays like most radical sports games featuring tricks and flicks instead of being &quot;on-rails&quot;), while other modes feature an higher focus on rhythm, like speed skating and figure skating. Curling plays like most games previously featuring the event, but there are two modes: simulation plays like the actual sport, where a team scores a point for each stone closer to the middle than the opponents&apos; closest, while game awards points for each of the stones inside the target. The game features three modes: Competition, where the player can participate in 5, 9 or all 16 events (or customize them), Campaign, where the player has to complete a number of quick goals to unlock additional tracks and features from previous games, while Career requires the player to compete in 15 levels with an increasing number of events to do the same.

  <plot>A wrestling game featuring a large and varied number of attractive women. The playable characters run the gamut: nurses, schoolgirls, cowgirls, ninjas, and many more. Each combatant has her own repository of clothes to choose from before each match, from a wide selection of standard wrestling outfits, to a series of bikinis, used mainly for the Mud Wrestling mode in the game.&amp;#xA;A great deal of the game revolves around the personalities of the fighters and the usage of the reputation system. Several matches will require that the player be sworn not to use dirty tactics such as using weapons found around the ring or even to humiliate the opponent. These oaths can be broken by the player, but the consequences are the loss of fan popularity and for the player&apos;s chosen character to develop a dark side to their persona.&amp;#xA;Popularity comes into play in the game, not only as a statistical boost for the player, but also as an actual aide in combat when the player finds the audience cheering and helping their character to win the match. Much like similar wrestling/fighting titles such as Def Jam: Fight for NY, this sort of help can be a difference maker in a close match.</plot>

The player takes the role of a Saint Seiya who has to save the life of the Goddess of Peace Athena. To do that he has to visit twelve temples representing the astrological signs. The gameplay of each level is divided into two parts: Reaching the palace and defeating the Gold Saint. The former is a traditional hack &amp; slash game where the player fights against hordes of enemies. He has the standard move repertoire to his disposal: regular attacks, dodging, blocking and special attacks. For the latter the player needs a certain amount of power in a special energy bar - it decreases with every special attack and increases if the player is hit. When reaching the temple the game switches to a one to one fighting game style. The basic gameplay stays the same but if the special energy bar is filled to the max the play can use an extremely powerful attack which results in a typical anime cutscene. But it is not without downsides: the enemy can block the attack by mastering a quicktime event (pressing a button in the exact moment it appears on screen). Then he starts an equally powerful counter attack which results in a sequence where both players need to mash buttons - if the counter attack is successful depends on which player is faster. If the life energy of one opponent is empty a similar sequence starts.</plot>

  <plot>Seven years after the fourth game in the series, Samurai Shodown returns. In the game&apos;s time frame, this is the earliest game, hence the Japanese title Samurai Spirits Zero. It takes place in 1786 from January through the later summer. The game is therefore considered a prequel to the series.&amp;#xA;The overall gameplay was slightly altered. It is a little faster, and the Slash/Bust system has been removed. Each character now has only one version, or the Bust mode is simply replaced by a new character of very similar setup. Combo slashes, sidestepping and fatalities have also vanished. The basic moves have been modeled after the first games in the series. They consist of three types of slashes, a single kick, and various dodge maneuvers similar to Samurai Shodown II.&amp;#xA;There are 24 characters, a familiar cast with some new faces. Unlike the previous games, it is not possible to kill your opponent.</plot>

  <plot>Samurai Warriors is Koei&apos;s extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era. In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo. Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.&amp;#xA;Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors. The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies. In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers. In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending. Updated graphics and a more &quot;techno-ish&quot; soundtrack top off the additions.</plot>

As with the original Samurai Warriors, Samurai Warriors 2 is based on the Japanese Sengoku or &quot;Warring States&quot; period, a time of social upheaval, political intrigue, and nearly constant military conflict in Japan that lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century.&amp;#xA;The game is a third person hack-and-slash. You have 26 playable characters to choose from. Once you choose your character you are tossed into massive real-time battles, with the object being to help claim victory for your army by defeating key enemy officers, or simply slaying a large amount of enemy troops, which will boost the morale of your army, and turn the tides of the battle.&amp;#xA;10 new warriors are added from the previous game including the legendary Musashi Miyamoto, the unifier of Japan Ieyasu Tokugawa, and the enigmatic ninja Kotaro Fuma. Each warrior has his own unique move set and techniques. Set traps, summon ninja decoys, and more. Use powerful Linked Charge attacks and power up to three Musou gauges. Now castle warfare blends seamlessly with field combat. Take control of castles on the battlefield to gain a significant morale advantage.

This is the story of the 1983 movie Scarface in which Tony Montana dies during a attack from a rival gang on his mansion at the end. The game now puts the player in the shoes of Tony a few moments before the gang hits his office.&amp;#xA;After he successfully defends his mansion, his empire lies in ruins. But Tony wouldn&apos;t be Tony Montana if he would just give up, so it is the player&apos;s goal to reclaim Miami once again. To do so, he has to earn money and respect. The only way to earn money in Miami is to deal drugs. At the beginning the stuff is bought in small amounts and personally sold to the dealers. Eventually, however, Tony can set up so-called &quot;Fronts&quot; which are legitimate shops (like a car seller) in which drugs are sold in very large amounts. By overtaking &quot;Fronts&quot;, Tony also increases his control over the current district of Miami. To completely overtake one part of town, all the enemy gangs scattered around in small groups must be eliminated.&amp;#xA;After a deal, Tony has to launder the money at the local bank and have it transferred to his account. He then can buy &quot;exotics&quot; for his mansion like an expensive vase or a new car with a driver.&amp;#xA;When talking with a dealer or trying to get cop heat down, the player has to play a mini-game that determines if Tony is successful and if so, how much he gets for the drugs or how much heat he loses.&amp;#xA;Respect is earned by increasing Tony&apos;s territory, buying exotics and earning &quot;balls&quot; in fights and while driving. The enemies have different target zones which give a different amount of balls on a hit. This also fills up Tony&apos;s &apos;ball-meter&quot;. Once this is full he can enter a kind of god mode in which he is invulnerable and has unlimited ammo. Tony also gets health when killing someone in this mode. If he is driving a car he gets balls when making stunts like driving on the wrong side of the road or dodging an incoming car.&amp;#xA;As in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the player is free to roam the city of Miami and there are also some side-missions with racing events.</plot>

Also, by collecting mubbers, you can create special costumes that will give you special powers. For example, with the Kung Fu Costume, you will be able to move around with greater agility and force. Be sure to watch your health level which is indicated by the number of Scooby Medals you have. If you reach zero, you will restart at the last save point but you can restore your health by collecting enough Scooby snacks that can be found throughout the game. Also, by collecting food items you can get Shaggy to cook you a special meal that will increase the total number of medals you have.&amp;#xA;In each world, when you&apos;ve collected enough clues, Velma will ask you a few questions in order to figure out who is behind everything, and you must select the clues that you feel will answer these questions. When that&apos;s completed, you will have to fight a boss before Velma will reveal who the identity of the villain.&amp;#xA;Scooby-Doo! Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu. You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points. You can replay any level as many times as you want so you can collect any missing items you still lack. In the extra menu, you will find Bonus Arts that features various conceptual art pieces used in the making of the game.</plot>

  <plot>Sea Monsters is based on the National Geographic CGI documentary of the same name, where earth&apos;s underwater world from millions of years ago is portrayed as a dangerous environment with different kinds of predators keeping the ecosystem intact.&amp;#xA;Players take command of six different prehistoric marine reptiles, each with their own skills and weaknesses. A large part is spent on exploration. The creatures need to hunt prey, avoid or defeat foes, unlock hidden challenges and eventually find a way to escape the dangerous waters.&amp;#xA;Creatures are controlled through the stylus to move them around. They can dodge with a quick tap (DS) or a swing (Wii) and go into combat mode to lock on targets and attack. Next to regular attacks, the creature can dodge an incoming attack and a bite icon appears. Quickly select it and the next attack will be much stronger. Some monsters have special abilities, activated by tapping the sonar icon in the bottom left corner when it becomes visible. This allows them to swim stealthily, dig, break rocks or jump.&amp;#xA;The creature&apos;s status is tracked through three parameters: health (hunger), stamina and oxygen. Health and stamina can be replenished by eating small creatures, while oxygen requires a regular trip to the surface. Creatures cannot dive deeper than fifty feet underwater. The bottom screen shows a large sonar. Dangerous monsters are bright red spots, food is green, collectible fossils are yellow (used to unlock new monsters) and portals are blue. Some fossils can only be found by defeating monsters or by completing challenges. Through their abilities, new monsters get access to new areas in the open sea, which serves as a hub. There are also a few wildcard fossils to move on to unlock any monster.&amp;#xA;The Wii and DS version are almost completely identical, but the Wii version also contains a multiplayer mode where players can race against friends in five different challenge zones.</plot>

If that is not enough, players can create their own custom teams. This is the career mode of the game. The objective is to create a squad of rookie players and take them to the top of the team rankings. As you succeed you will earn skill points that can be used to increase the quality of your team.&amp;#xA;Sensible Soccer 2006 offers multiplayer matches (no online play though) for up to four players at once (in which two players share the control of a team).

  <plot>Shadow Hearts II is a direct sequel to the unusual console-style RPG set in a real world and in a concrete epoch. It is 1915, and war raises its ugly head to greet the nations of Europe. Half a year after the events described in the first game, the young Yuri Hyuga finds himself in a small French village under attack of German soldiers. But soldiers are not the only threat that awaits him: a mysterious magician that seems to have a personal grudge against the hero appears on the scene. Accompanied by friends who follow him for various reasons, Yuri will travel all over Europe and to the Far East, and once again face his own past.&amp;#xA;&quot;Shadow Hearts II&quot; implements a combat system that is similar to the first game: the Judgment Ring, an arcade addition to strategic combat, is still there, along with Yuri&apos; special ability to transform into monsters and to visit the graveyard for more powerful fusion variants. The Sanity Points system from the first game is also present. Character upgrading is now more flexible (you can assign different magic spells to characters), and you can also team up to perform combo attacks.</plot>

  <plot>Shadow Hearts is a console-style RPG set in a historical period: China and Europe of 1913, one year before the World War.&amp;#xA;The game&apos;s hero is Yuri Hyuga, a young harmonixer: a man who possesses the power of transforming into demons. He meets Alice Elliot, a young British girl whose father was brutally murdered, and who is chased by a mysterious warlock who calls himself Roger Bacon. Yuri and Alice travel through the pre-war China, dealing with demons, evil magicians, and Japanese occupation army. The journey eventually takes them and their friends to Europe, where they have to confront their ultimate enemy, but also uncover the truth about their own pasts.&amp;#xA;Shadow Hearts implements traditional turn-based combat style for the battles, adding to it a feature called Judgment Ring. Every time you perform an attack a ring with a spinning arrow appears on the top of the screen. If you hit a critical area on the ring, your attack will be more powerful. However, missing a hit area will cancel the attack. Various types of attack have rings of various difficulty; usually, the more powerful a spell is, the smaller the hit area is on the ring. The Judgment Ring is also used for other purposes; it can help you reduce prices in stores, and is needed to solve many puzzles.</plot>

Making full use of the Wii Balance Board accessory, Road Trip allows players to hit the slopes in a more dynamic way. By using the Balance Board as a virtual snowboard, players can ride the various runs and perform tricks and other techniques such as carving, grinding and speed-boosting.&amp;#xA;As with many snowboarding games, there are numerous riders with various skills and abilities to unlock and choose from. But unique to this title is the choice of a cameraman companion. This second character films your run from behind you and also provides a particular momentary power-up. This may be a Speed Boost, Jump Boost or Trick Boost etc.&amp;#xA;On your road trip, you will visit many locations and continents. In a sense, you&apos;re following the trail of Shaun White himself. This is demonstrated when he makes occasional calls to your mobile phone and updates you on his new location. You&apos;re physically one location behind him, and need to complete certain runs and objectives in order to progress to the next location, whether it is Canada, Japan, Switzerland and many other exotic and snow-capped places.&amp;#xA;The game also supports play without the use of the Balance Board and requires motion-gesture input from the Wii remote.

Using a third-person perspective, you experience napalm bombardments of civilian villages, sneaky night missions along the river banks, claustrophobic tunnel systems and huge battles in temples and open fields. Most missions are played as a team, but your team members cannot die and do no influence the mission objectives. You will have to assassinate enemy generals, take out crucial boats and guide your team through unknown territory.&amp;#xA;The game does not have drivable vehicles, multiplayer options or extensive environmental interaction, but it features an interesting system of dismantling the many bombs and traps: in a race against time, you have to perform a long key sequence in the correct order to clear the path. The atrocities on both sides are clearly shown in the cutscenes, filmed as through a shaky hand-camera. Either side is not afraid to abuse civilians for their cause and this sense of realism gives the game a rather raw edge. You can even purchase the services of hookers in the base camp.&amp;#xA;The game was originally developed for the PS2 and then ported to the Xbox and PC.

  <plot>For many years, the members of the Kuzunoha family have been skillful detectives, specializing in supernatural cases. They have mastered the secret of devil summoning - call forth beasts from hell and make them fight against their own kind, on your side. This unique ability was transferred from parent to child over generations.&amp;#xA;It is the Taishou era in Japan: the First World War is over, and the country enters rapid industrialization, growing to become one of the leading economies in the world. You play as the fourteenth Raidou Kuzunoha, and one seemingly ordinary case makes you confront a demon. That&apos;s where your newly discovered devil-summoning skills come in handy. After defeating your first demonic enemy and summoning your first allies, you are determined to explore the city, to solve supernatural cases, and to find the truth behind the demons&apos; presence.&amp;#xA;This is the third entry in the Devil Summoner sub-series of the Megaten franchise. Unlike the two previous games, &quot;Raidou Kuzunoha&quot; incorporates action combat into the traditional demon-summoning system. You can still capture and summon various demons, but they will be controlled by AI (which you can configure) during battles. You have physical control over Raidou Kuzunoha; although the battles take place on separate screens, like in usual turn-based Asian RPGs, you can move freely and attack enemies in real time. You can use sword or gun attacks, and also perform different moves such as dashing and striking the opponent. You can also defend by pressing buttons at the correct time. Outside of battles, you will have to do a lot of detective work: walking around the city, talking to suspects, hunting for information, etc. Some demon abilities can also be used outside of combat to gain advantage in your investigation.</plot>

Once again, the player takes the role of Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th, the youngest in the long line of devil summoners. It is the Taishou period (the 1920-ies) in Japan, and once again the Capital City is threatened by supernatunal forces. Raidou works undercover at the Narumi Detective Agency, solving cases with mysterious backgrounds. It all begins when a young woman enters the office and asks the detective to find a missing man...&amp;#xA;The game is part of the larger series dedicated to generations of devil summoners, which, in its turn, is a part of the meta-series Megaten. As in the first Raidou Kuzunoha game, the core gameplay is action-oriented. Raidou attacks enemies with swords or guns; but like before, he will need help from his demonic allies to defeat the foes. Raidou is able to summon two (as opposed to one in the first game) demons to help him in battles. The main gameplay difference is that instead of simply weakening enemies to capture them, as it was the case in the first game, now Raidou has to talk to hostile demons and persuade them to join his party, thus returning to the long-running Megaten tradition of demon negotiations as integral part of gameplay.</plot>

  <plot>Junkyard, the town of endless rain... a grim world, where only the fittest can survive. People are divided into tribes that constantly fight each other in order to become the strongest in Junkyard. For only the strongest, the champion of Junkyard, can set on a journey to find Nirvana - a legendary land that is just the opposite of the sinister Junkyard. Serph is a fighter of a tribe called Embryon. Like all the others, he also wants to become the champion and to reach Nirvana. One day a mysterious object called &quot;The Pod&quot; appears. Serph and his friends are affected by its lights, and a result they find out they have gained supernatural, demonic powers. This is when Serph&apos;s quest truly begins.&amp;#xA;&quot;Digital Devil Saga&quot; is a part of Megaten game universe, related to Shin Megami Tensei and Persona. Unlike all other Megaten games, you can&apos;t communicate with random enemies (demons) by talking to them, and also can&apos;t summon them in battles. Instead, Serph and his party are able to turn into demons themselves. During the round-based combat, the characters can fight as demons or as humans (using guns). The most important combat element is the ability to devour defeated foes. Each devoured enemy adds to your karma points, which can later be assigned to learn various skills.</plot>

  <plot>The first Shin Megami Tensei game officially released outside of Japan, this is the English translation of what is known in Japan as Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax, an enhanced version of the original Shin Megami Tensei III.&amp;#xA;The third installment of the most important series within Megaten Universe, &quot;SMT: Nocturne&quot; continues the tradition of post-apocalyptic setting with demonic overtones that became the trademark of the series. You play as a high-school student in modern Tokyo. One day you go to visit your teacher in a hospital. Unable to find her, you encounter a strange man in the basement, and soon thereafter witness the event of great destruction - the Conception. The world around the young man changes drastically, as monsters invade it, and the high demonic powers of the universe make it to the arena of their eternal fight - the struggle between Law and Chaos. Will the hero be able to find his path within this cosmic battle, even at the cost of losing his human nature?&amp;#xA;Just like the two previous Shin Megami Tensei games, &quot;SMT: Nocturne&quot; allows you to communicate with random enemies and to recruit them into your party. The fights are turn-based, and are viewed from third-person perspective, unlike in earlier SMT games. The exploration of 3D dungeons is also done from over-the-shoulder view. True to the spirit of SMT series, you can choose your own moral path in the game, siding with one of the struggling forces, or fighting against both. New in this enhanced version (compared to the Japanese-only &quot;Shin Megami Tensei III&quot;) are: additional items and monsters, optional dungeons, two difficulty levels, an extra ending (in additional to the other five possible), and the appearance of Dante, the popular character from Devil May Cry series.</plot>

  <plot>Having lost your parents as a child, you lived in the suburbs with your relatives, until they decided to send you to a high school located on an island near the port city Iwatodai. But as you attempt to enter your new dormitory, you are attacked by a mysterious creature. As a result, you discover within yourself the gift to call upon a higher being, Persona, that grants you immense power. Your new ability makes you decide to investigate the strange world of shadows that has been plaguing the city every midnight, and to find out who or what is behind it.&amp;#xA;This sequel in the Persona series, which is part of the huge Megaten franchise, is not directly connected to its predecessors story-wise. The gameplay has also underwent significant changes, throwing an element of &quot;school simulation&quot; into the already unusual Megaten RPG formula. You get to live the life of a normal high-school student: you attend classes, talk to your friends, get homework, wait for the summer vacation, and so on. The game is divided into school days with their own schedule.&amp;#xA;However, at midnight the real world freezes, and only you and your friends with the unique Persona abilities can feel the time flowing as they battle the shadows. The battles follow the classic Megaten model of demon-summoning. You can either attack with your weapons, or call a mighty Persona from within yourself. After the battle is won, you receive Persona cards, which can be fused to get more powerful Personae. Inspired by the system used in Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne, you are able to hit enemies&apos; weakpoints with your magic spells. Taking advantage of these weakpoints means that you can perform devastating combo attacks while the enemy is weakened.</plot>

As such it is considered the spiritual successor to Shining Force NEO inheriting many of the game&apos;s traits.&amp;#xA;Players choose to be either the warrior Toma or the sorceress Cyrille. They are almost immediately joined by the knight Gadfort and the elfin archer Maebelle. They all have different reasons to join the quest and find the holy sword Shining Force. The main storyline focuses on the devastating war between humans and demons. The game takes place in a world divided into two kingdoms: The Noswald Empire (humans) and Fyrlandt (demons).&amp;#xA;The player&apos;s base of operations is the Geo-Fortress which is a mobile base, and along the way there is the ability to upgrade the fortress. This is done by collecting &quot;rare material&quot; which allows the fortress to be upgraded to three forms, each time more powerful. Only in the final form it becomes possible to travel around. The strategy elements center around the fortress. Players can make room for shops, train party members and choose who to take along on quests. It can also be attacked and needs to be defended.</plot>

  <plot>Shinobido: Way of the Ninja is stealth-action game, that is comparable to the well known Tenchu series. The gameplay&apos;s main idea is to complete your missions without being noticed by guards, watchdogs or even harmless townsmen. Carefully approaching of your enemies from behind is crucial, because your character isn&apos;t very capable in direct combat.&amp;#xA;A huge difference in comparison to Tenchu is, that the game is widely non-linear, which means that you can choose the missions you want to participate in at almost any given time. There are three landlords for whom you can accept missions. Depending on your choices the trust of each landlord in you increases or decreases. The game allows you to use alchemy, by which you can create your own equipment like strength potions and smoke bombs. Shinobido also gives you your own hideout, around which you can place decoration like various trees as well as traps to strike back invading enemies.&amp;#xA;The story takes place in the Japanese province of Utakata in the 16th century. You take on the role of the ninja Goh, the sole survivor of the Azuka Clan, who finds himself unconsciously lying near a river having completely lost his memory. After finding a magical stone containing tiny fragments of the events that took place before his awakening, he decides that the only way to find out more about his past is to localize the remaining stones.</plot>

There are four leagues with increasing difficulty and six races each - to get access to the next league the player has to be number one in average after all six races. But there is one special gimmick: the shox zones. There are three of those zones per race and the player has to drive through them as fast as possible. If he gets the gold medal in all three a shock wave manifests which makes controlling the car difficult - the goal is to stay in touch with this wave as long as possible. All those accomplishments reward money which is reinvested into new cars (which are divided into four classes). But the player has to be careful: every impact with opponents or the edge results in a fee. Money can be faster earned by making a bet where the player has to race against one opponent.&amp;#xA;The cars are licensed and the courses are divided into three locations: Arctic Tundra, Arid Desert, and Asian Jungle</plot>

  <plot>The player is cast in a role of James Sunderland, on first sight a normal person who got confused as anyone else would as he received a letter from his wife asking him to come to Silent Hill, to their special place. The only problem is that his wife died three years ago, and has kept the secrets surrounding her death. James decides to honor the letter&apos;s request, wondering if this is a sick joke or if there is more to this. As James reaches the outskirt of Silent Hill, he finds that the road is blocked, and parks at an abandoned restroom. Little does he realize that this is the first step forward into the mystery of Silent Hill.&amp;#xA;This is the original Silent Hill 2 game with no extras of any kind, and released for PlayStation 2 exclusively. A version with new weapons, new characters to play with, and new &quot;Born from a Wish&quot; scenario was released as Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams.

  <plot>You are Henry Townshend, a man living in a small apartment in South Ashfield, a neighboring town of the infamous Silent Hill. On one strange night, Henry has a terrible nightmare, with recurring events; his phone is dead, his windows are sealed, and his neighbors can&apos;t hear him. He looks at his door, only to see it is blocked by several, thick metal chains. A note is pinned to the door: &amp;quot;Don&apos;t go out!&amp;quot; It is signed only by a man named Walter. Henry explores his apartment, trying to figure out what is happening, when he spots a giant hole in the wall of his bathroom. Henry goes through the hole, only to find a portal which leads him to alternate dimensions. Hopefully, Henry will find out the truth about his apartment, Room 302, and live.&amp;#xA;Silent Hill 4: The Room is similar to past games in terms of atmosphere. The game is dark and foreboding, never letting you know what&apos;s behind the next corner or down the street.&amp;#xA;SH4 takes the series in a new direction, with multiple new features. First and foremost is never actually leaving your apartment. You utilize a strange portal to travel to alternate dimensions, including a hospital, a cult command center deep in the forest, and a prison.&amp;#xA;Aside from the traditional third-person-view, there is now a first-person mode, which is used to control Henry when he is in his apartment. The game has a feature that, whenever you look at something of importance, an eyeball will appear to tell you that you can interact with it.&amp;#xA;The previous games have mostly been about exploring the town and solving puzzles, but Silent Hill 4 has much more combat involved. There are more enemies in a given area, and more narrow areas and cramped spaces. To help you in combat, you&apos;ve got the standard arsenal of Silent Hill games, such as the steel pipe, pistol, and new to this game, a golf club.</plot>

  <plot>The Simpsons Game is an action platformer based on the long-running cartoon. The Simpson family finds themselves trapped in a video game and must fight their way out using their newly found powers. Homer can expand into a rolling blob, Bart can become Bartman (with grappling hook), Lisa can use her saxophone to stun enemies, and Marge can gather mobs with her megaphone. Each character has a power meter that limits the use of the special abilities, which is recharged by defeating enemies. They also have powers that can only be used at specific trigger points, such as Bart catching updrafts with his cape, Homer inflating himself with helium, Lisa summoning the hand of Buddha to move objects, and Marge sending Maggie into crawlspaces. The abilities are upgraded throughout the game. Each character also has an item they can pick up which will make them temporarily invulnerable, and give them unlimited special attacks for this period.&amp;#xA;The game is divided into a series of sixteen &quot;episodes&quot;, each a parody of a popular game or genre; these episodes have names like Medal of Homer or Neverquest. Each level features two or more of the Simpson clan. Players must switch back and forth using each family members&apos; unique powers to complete each level.

  <plot>Aerospace technology has linked the world together; introducing speedy planes, high flying airships and massive flying fortresses. Because of air piracy and other dangers, the occupation of Skygunners have appeared. Part freelancer and part mercenary, they are often hired for their daring skills in the air. Ciel and Copain are two such Skygunners, relaxing at the town of Rive. The police chief of Rive asks the two gunners to act as security for the town&apos;s scientific expo, and assigns his agent Femme to the group as well. What seems like a simple babysitting task soon turns to adventure when the criminal scientific genius, Ventre shows up, with his gang of loyal Poulet doll-henchmen. As Ventre orchestrates the theft of the Eternal Engine, a perpetual motion machine that could forever power his inventions, it&apos;s up to Ciel, Copain and Femme to take to the skies and foil Ventre&apos;s plans.&amp;#xA;SkyGunner is a 3rd person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Copain or Femme, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane&apos;s direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, use afterburners and breaking. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: &amp;quot;Look Targeting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Weapon Lock&amp;quot;. Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy as the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to fire on them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group.&amp;#xA;The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, and include Fireworks Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.</plot>

  <plot>Sly and the gang is back in this third outing of Sly Raccoon-series.&amp;#xA;This time, the story takes the boys (Sly, Bentley and Murray) to the fortress that houses the treasures of Sly&apos;s family. Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly&apos;s business and the loss of his family heritage.&amp;#xA;The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric sections are the main focus of the game.&amp;#xA;If you like games that had many things to do, this sneak-em-up/platform/action/adventure/puzzle game is for you.</plot>

A target by law enforcement, a target by rival smugglers and gang, a target by more militaristic forces of the United States.&amp;#xA;If you can survive the high speed chases, the off-road evasion, the gunfire and the dust... you stand to make quite a profit. Maybe enough to outfit your vehicle for your next smuggling endeavor.

  <plot>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are.&amp;#xA;The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a &apos;bullet cam&apos; which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target.&amp;#xA;The game also includes a multi-player mode with a number of different game types.</plot>

  <plot>As Snoopy sleeps atop his doghouse, the player is transported into his dreams about the adventures of his alter ego, the &quot;World Famous WWI Flying Ace. The rest of the Peanuts characters are woven into his dream - and thereby the game&apos;s narrative - as they pass by the sleeping beagle. Lucy Van Pelt becomes the commander of the Allied forces, Linus and Sally take humorous turns as intelligence officers, while poor Charlie Brown is characteristically cast as a janitor in an Allied airbase. The story moves quickly after Charlie Brown is captured by the Red Baron&apos;s minions along with the plans for a secret weapon that could change the course of the war. Snoopy and his co-pilot Woodstock take to the skies in his trusty Sopwith Camel to recover the plans and rescue Snoopy&apos;s hapless owner.&amp;#xA;The game mechanics center around third-person action adventure flight in contexts such as aerial races, dogfighting missions, and world exploration. Collectible items in the world unlock plane and weapon upgrades, as well as new character/plane combinations for use in versus multiplayer aerial combat. Hardcore Peanuts fans will recognize the front lines at Verdun, the woods of Montsec and Verdon Gorge as the settings for Snoopy&apos;s original Flying Ace adventures in the comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. The game features 7 of these locations, which often change considerably from mission to mission.&amp;#xA;The flight model for Snoopy&apos;s Sopwith Camel and the other planes in the game leans heavily towards the fanciful arcade end of the realism spectrum. Controls and collision are forgiving and approachable for younger players, although advanced stunts such as barrel rolls and Immelmans are accessible through button combos for experienced aficionados of the air combat genre. The game includes boss sequences that offer novel variations on its core mechanics. For example, players will battle a flotilla of submarines as Woodstock, being towed behind Snoopy&apos;s plane in a toy balsa-wood glider. Here the mechanics are those of a rail shooter, with Snoopy pulling the player along a path while the player contends with a multi-stage boss fight.&amp;#xA;Pre-rendered cut scenes advance the narrative between missions as the player returns to a &quot;hub world&quot; represented by Charlie Brown&apos;s neighborhood. Here the player can upgrade his plane and weapons at Pig-Pen&apos;s Shop or complete a series of tutorials at Marcie&apos;s Flight School. The music and voiceovers in these sequences recall the classic Peanuts holiday specials that have been an annual fixture of American television since 1965.</plot>

  <plot>The Sopranos: Road to Respect is a third person action-adventure game based on the popular HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.&amp;#xA;In the game, the player portrays Joey LaRocca, a young enforcer working in the organization of Tony Soprano. Joey is the illegitimate son of Sal &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero, who was revealed to be an informant and was killed by Tony at the end of Season 2 of the television show. The storyline of the game involves Joey attempting to rise up in Tony&apos;s organization and come out from under the shadow of his father.&amp;#xA;The game is linear mission-based. Most missions are given at one of the signature Sopranos locations, such as the Bada Bing or Satriale&apos;s. Each of these locations is modeled to look identical to the location from the television show. The player is given low-level tasks such as money collection and body dumping at first, but the story quickly ramps up to draw the player into a mob war between Tony Soprano&apos;s New Jersey crew and the the crew of Angelo Buscetta in Philadelphia.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is primarily brawler-based, with melee combos available and numerous weapons of opportunity, such as baseball bats, lamps, barbells, and whatever can be found at hand. The player can also use the environment as a weapon, slamming the enemy&apos;s head into a filing cabinet or even pushing his face into a table saw.&amp;#xA;There is some firearm combat in the game, which uses a typical third-person targeting system. However the player is taught early on that opening fire in a public place will cause a loss of respect from his peers. If the respect bar drops to zero, the player is killed by his own crew.&amp;#xA;At various points in the game during conversations with an NPC, the player is prompted to have Joey act tough, play it smooth, or go somewhere in between. The decisions made here can determine whether the player ends up in a fight, or is able to talk his way out of the situation.&amp;#xA;The game also features a poker mini-game. The player can play Texas Hold &apos;Em against Tony, Christopher and Paulie. Once unlocked early in the campaign, the mini-game becomes available at the Bada Bing or directly from the main menu.&amp;#xA;Voice acting for The Sopranos characters is handled by the actors who perform the role on the television program, including James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano.</plot>

Raziel reluctantly agrees and heads off to discover the knowledge and weapons that will allow him to achieve his goal.&amp;#xA;Soul Reaver 2 is a 3rd person adventure game, like the first game.

Raziel can shift through the &quot;material&quot; world into the &quot;spectral&quot; realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel&apos;s life energy at a constant rate. Raziel must restore energy by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. Raziel no longer gains abilities from absorbing great souls and instead must imbue his Soul Reaver weapon by activating certain elemental temples. Once activated, various &quot;elemental fonts&quot; can be used to charge the Soul Reaver to specific attributes. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of other weapons including daggers, swords, axes, spears as well as the Soul Reaver and bare-handed claws.&amp;#xA;Unlike the previous game, Soul Reaver 2 is linear and follows specific paths through different areas.

  <plot>25 years after Space Invaders was released, Taito has decided to bring us a special anniversary edition that includes all the versions of Space Invaders that were ever released in the arcades, plus two extra game modes. These include:&amp;#xA;1. Space Invaders - monochrome version: The original, as first appeared in 1978. Move your ship left or right, shooting at oncoming invaders, while dodging theirs. Shoot the flying saucer that goes across the screen for extra points. Four barriers protect you from invaders&apos; shots, but will be destroyed after several hits. Once you shoot every invader on screen, you have to do it again and again. The game ends when all lives are lost.&amp;#xA;2. Space Invaders - color version: Same version as above, but in color.&amp;#xA;3. Space Invaders - cellophane version: Five strips of cellophane (cyan, green, yellow, blue, red) are placed across the game screen, in an attempt to block out the two black areas.&amp;#xA;4. Space Invaders - upright version: Space Invaders in color, but a background has been added, and contains a planet and some stars.&amp;#xA;5. Space Invaders doubles: Two players can play at the same time. Lives are separate, so if one players loses all their lives, the other keeps on playing.&amp;#xA;6. Space Invaders Part II: Known as Space Invaders Deluxe in the US. The differences between the original and this game is that there are two different flying saucers: one is steadily visible and another blinks. Different points are awarded for each one that is killed. Also, from wave two onwards, invaders can be split into two when shot, and the flying saucers drop alien reinforcements. Also available as a cocktail cabinet.&amp;#xA;2. Space Invaders VS: Two-player game. The screen is split is split into two, with each side reserved for each player. Invaders occupy both sides. The object of the game is to kill these invaders, so that you can destroy the ship at the top of the screen that belongs to your opponent. Matches are determined before the start of the game. You can have a CPU opponent.&amp;#xA;7. Space Invaders 3D: Everything on screen appears in 3D. Instead of bullets, not only do invaders shoot arrows at you, but they can launch fireballs at you. You lose a life when you come in contact with these. As always, flying saucers go across the screen, but will then fly directly toward you.

A break-off piece of Venom&apos;s symbiote begin infecting New Yorkers and it is up to Spider-Man to save the city. He can switch between the back and red suits at any time, which each have their own move set and abilities.&amp;#xA;As Spider-Man defeats enemies, he is given skill points which can be used to purchased boosted stats and new moves. These are separate for each costume. In general, red focuses on agility and black on brutality. In order to purchase moves you must have not only the necessary points, but sufficient reputation. Throughout the game, you have conversations with other characters where you are given red, black or neutral choices. Answering red or black will build that suit&apos;s reputation, as will various other actions throughout the game.&amp;#xA;You can take five power-ups into each level. These can be special abilities, such as temporary invincibility, or the titular allies. When summoned, they appear on screen and do their specific type of damage, then disappear. Allies are unlocked by beating bosses. The red suit unlocks hero allies like Luke Cage and Storm and the black suit unlocks villain allies like Galactus and Hobgoblin.</plot>

The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains like Kraven, the Lizard, Scorpion, Rhino and the Kingpin, or breaking up various gang factions.&amp;#xA;One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man&apos;s black symbiote costume. When wearing the traditional red and blue costume, Spider-Man is more fast and is more accepted by the public. When wearing the black costume, Spider-Man becomes stronger and more aggressive.&amp;#xA;The game also includes &quot;cineractives&quot; - cinematic scenes that allow for participation via button presses or controller movements.&amp;#xA;This version also has the inclusion of Morbius and Shriek as bosses to fight against. The black costume is an interchangeable accessory after a certain point in the game, but can threaten to overwhelm Peter if worn too long.&amp;#xA;The Wii version allows for full web-swinging control via the Wiimote and Nunchuk.

There is also the classic light-saber, slicing opponents up with the ability to change its colors by finding different color crystals throughout the game.&amp;#xA;Players can upgrade these powers by destroying enemies, filling up on blue orbs that are left behind to earn points to earn more powerful attacks. More force orbs can be obtained by using flashy and complex on enemies. The player will also encounter bosses towards the end of the levels, ranging from Jedi&apos;s to large creatures like a Rancor.

  <plot>Starsky &amp; Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio &apos;Huggy Bear&apos; Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble.&amp;#xA;Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky &amp; Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.&amp;#xA;The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal&apos;s car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.&amp;#xA;Dave Starsky is the guy behind the steering wheel and Ken &apos;Hutch&apos; Hutchinson shoots out of the windows of the car. On PS2 and XBox a second player can take care of the shooting, using either a light gun or a standard controller. During single player, the aiming is automatic for shooting.</plot>

Steel Dragon Evolution - a sequel to Steel Dragon only released in this compilation&amp;#xA;Steel Dragon Evolution gives the player a choice between three different space crafts and six different pilots. The pilots only determine the shot colour, while the crafts vary in speed and fire power. Up to two players can play simultaneously. The goal of the game is to progress far enough in each stage to beat the end boss, ultimately winning all levels.&amp;#xA;Players have only a limited amount of lives, however, extra lives can be obtained during the game. The main feature of Steel Dragon Evolution is that the main fire button is analogue. The more pressure is applied to the button, the heavier the fire power of the player&apos;s craft becomes. As a trade-off at the same time the craft&apos;s speed is reduced. Alternatively, three separate buttons for low, medium and heavy fire can be pressed.&amp;#xA;If a player destroys an enemy, a multiplier is applied from 1x to 256x depending on how heavy the fire power applied was. However, some enemies drop stars which also have a multiplier of 1x to 256x attached to them. Here the scale is reversed, not firing at all while collecting the stars gives the highest multiplier.</plot>

You can&apos;t make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can&apos;t survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.</plot>

  <plot>Summer Athletics: The Ultimate Challenge is a collection of sports events based on the Olympic Summer Games. It features 26 sports divided into seven disciplines: Swimming, jumping, throwing, cycling, running, platform diving and archery. The handling is similar for all of them: rhythmic motions to keep the athlete moving and quick time events (pressing a button when it gets displayed on the screen) for performing certain actions. The mentioned rhythmic motions depend on the input device the player uses, e.g. at the swimming event the player needs to press two buttons alternately when using a keyboard and rotate the analog sticks when using a gamepad.&amp;#xA;The game features a basic career mode where the player gains a fixed amount of experience points after every event which an be reinvested into improved stats. There is also a optional arcade mode where the players have so-called boosts to their disposal to improve their athlete&apos;s performance for a short time.</plot>

Joseph&apos;s culture hated the goddess Laharah and called her the &quot;goddess of death.&amp;#xA;This sequel takes place twenty years later in the realms of Halassar, Galdyr and Munari City which are across the world. You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph&apos;s kinship, Maia&apos;s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so.&amp;#xA;Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia&apos;s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia&apos;s skills improve. You can also choose to adventure in &quot;solo-mode&quot;, leaving your party members behind to go on alone.&amp;#xA;If you played the first game, you will notice immediately that Summoner 2 has a different combat system.

Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island. And to top it all off, the prince and princess of the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren&apos;t found and returned, there&apos;s sure to be trouble! Can our heroes restore order to Monearth?&amp;#xA;Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on it. Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up.&amp;#xA;Certain parts of the island are locked by &apos;Puzzle Gates&apos; - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages which can be accessed in front of the gate.

  <plot>Originally released as OZ (Over Zenith) in Japan, The Sword of Etheria is a single-player, 3rd person, role playing game with anime type graphics in a fantasy setting. Although some character names have been borrowed from The Wizard of Oz, the similarity ends there. The hero and main character is Fiel (&quot;Feel&quot; in the Japanese version), a boy who lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his sister Dorothy. Although they are human, Fiel and Dorothy can tap into their world&apos;s magical power, Etheria. Toto, their special cat, is able to transform itself into a sword. The brother and sister share their ability with the Katina, spiritual creatures captured and employed by evil gods to tyrannize mankind. Feel frees two Katina (Almira and Leon) and they join with him on his quest to vanquish the evil gods, rescue their world and reclaim the life-giving power of Etheria. The story unfolds during 20 chapters called &quot;stages&quot;. Gameplay includes exploration of the world in a free-roaming style, conversations with NPCs and party members. Objects and animals in the environment can be destroyed to find valuable items. Combat relies heavily on teamwork and how well the player works with the AI-controlled companions. Attack combinations during battle involve passing an enemy back and forth between party members. The more adept the player becomes in handling the chained combat moves, the more bonuses and rankings can be gained. Each character can be equipped with various armor, weaponry, and enchanted items like rings and necklaces. Items are found or can be purchased within the game. Dialog choices during gameplay effect the &quot;affection&quot; value of Almira and Leon. A partner with a higher ranking in this area will chain up your combo/pass more frequently. There are at least three different endings which are determined by which mode you are playing as well as your dialog choices. The game features Easy, Normal and Hard difficulty modes. The main difference between these modes is the amount and types of enemies that appear, items found in chests and dropped by enemies, and the respawn rate in some boss battles. In Story Mode, only Feel can be controlled until later stages when another one of the trio can be selected. Unlockables are only available after completing the game in this mode and include bonus stages, special items, costumes, characters and a gallery with music, sounds and images.</plot>

  <plot>Sword of the Samurai is a unique &quot;semi-RPG&quot; where you play a wandering samurai (or ronin to be exact as you seem to have no master) trying to make a name for yourself in Japan and ultimately to become a master swordsman if you win the Shogun held swordsman competition.&amp;#xA;The gameplay focuses on improving and enhancing your somewhat terrible sword skill technique. As at the beginning of the game your sword play starts with what seems like &quot;swinging a bat&quot; rather than a sword technique, you improve your skill and techniques by &quot;stealing&quot; techniques by dueling with other swordsmen of which you add to your own library of sword techniques and customize which techniques suit your purposes.&amp;#xA;The &quot;semi-RPG&quot; elements refer to the &quot;skill and techniques&quot; development of your character. The more duels, missions and bouts your character accomplishes, the more sword techniques your character will eventually learn as well as gradually increasing your character stats.&amp;#xA;Thus dueling is the essence of the gameplay, may it be a friendly match with wooden swords or unofficial death matches using your steel sword (katana).&amp;#xA;Swordplay techniques are extremely complicated at first, comprising of detailed forms: Stances, each with different types of attacks; Parrying and the ability to counter attack after a correct block; Stance Attack, the ability for a surprise attack against a correct stance and much more.&amp;#xA;Learn all these techniques by dueling, learning from the local dojo&apos;s and ultimately gaining enough fame and skill to duel the many wandering master swordsmen that may teach you a thing or two about special sword skills.</plot>

As in other rhythm games, the goal is to interact with a special controller according to scrolling onscreen prompts timed to music. This game comes bundled with the TaTaCon drum controller, a miniature version of a Japanese taiko drum with sensors in the middle and on the sides. In-game actions are indicated by scrolling circle icons. Red circles indicate hitting the center of the drum, while blue circles require the player to hit the edge. On big circles, the player can hit both center or edge sensors for bonus points. Finally, yellow lines and balloons require the player to perform drum rolls. The game comes with a varied set of tunes: from covered pop hits like Material Girl and ABC to music from other Namco games such as Katamari Damacy and Dragon Spirit and even television theme songs. In addition, there are also several mini-games included on the disc that use the TaTaCon for more esoteric purposes, such as watermelon eating and wolf-stacking. The Japanese release is mostly the same, including keeping the game completely in English, but switches out a few of the tracks (particularly the TV show themes) for songs recognizable to Japanese audiences, such as We Will Rock You, I&apos;m A Slave 4 U, and I Was Born To Love You.</plot>

  <plot>Tak, hero from the previous game has been randomly falling into deep sleeps. During this time, he travels to a &quot;Dream World&quot;, where he is told that he must rescue a princess, or else he will fall into a sleep from which he will never awaken from. Tak and Jibolba, Tak&apos;s mentor, travel to visit Jibolba&apos;s brother, JB, who is an expert in dreams.&amp;#xA;Tak 2 is fairly different from Tak and the Power of Juju. While it is still a 3D platform game, it is more focused on puzzles and combat as opposed to collecting items. In earlier stages, Tak must use animals to his advantage as he makes his way through levels - for example, a bear can be used as a trampoline, Tak can ride warthogs after being sprayed by skunks to mask his scent, and more. Jibolba is along for the ride, but has transformed into a flea for easy transport. As a result, you can throw him at enemies to bite them and make them sleepy.&amp;#xA;Later on, Tak gains the power to transform into various animals himself. As a frog he can swim without being eaten by crocodiles, he can soar on air currents as a flying squirrel, and can break through barriers by charging through as a warthog. When Tak gains the titular Staff of Dreams as he progresses through the game, he can also create more powerful attacks using his magic, or &quot;juju&quot;.</plot>

  <plot>Tales of the Abyss is the story of Luke fon Fabre&apos;s unintentional journey outside of his mansion, which he has been locked inside of for the last several years, since he was found in an abandoned castle after an kidnapping attempt, with no recollection of his past. Luke soon uncovers a plot to destroy the world as he knows it, and he and his ever expanding party of comrades (including a fire spewing mouse-thing named Mieu) must help to unite two kingdoms, and settle on the matter of his own identity before the world comes to an end.&amp;#xA;ToA uses the same basic combat engine as its predecessors. The battles takes place on a pseudo-2D fighting ground that resembles the surrounding wilderness. You can set your party members to an AI controlled setting or give commands to each one by cycling through them in battle. This style can be somewhat of a hassle for those RPG fans who are used to the Final Fantasy style of combat, and it takes some getting used to even for Tales series veterans.&amp;#xA;The way the rest of the game plays is similar to that of traditional RPGS: you and your party go through many different towns, explore lots of dungeons, and explore. The exploration is done via the World Map screen, which is an isometric view that follows your character around as you move.</plot>

It is not a traditional one-on-one fighter, but an arena-based, four-player game - somewhat along the lines of Power Stone.&amp;#xA;There are two game modes. There is a single-player adventure mode in which you must guide one of ten characters (including six unlockables) through a series of 100 bouts that have you either beating up enemies, or, in a few cases, dodging bombs for a set amount of time. Completion of these portions unlocks the additional characters, bonus characters and stages for melee mode.&amp;#xA;Melee mode is the multiplayer portion. It has ten basic and twelve unlockable characters, and nine basic and fifteen unlockable stages. There are four game types which mirror popular types from first-person shooters. There is a deathmatchesque knock-out mode, where the goal is to score the most KOs. (Players respawn after being KOed.) There is also a Last Man Standing mode, where the goal is to be the only player left when the others are KOed, a King of the Hill, where you must stand on a glowing patch of ground and defend it from other players, and a Keep away mode, where you must hold a treasure chest and avoid other players who are trying to beat you up and take it.</plot>

There are three kinds of racing to master: Circuit, Blitz, and Scramble.&amp;#xA;Circuit Races are exactly as they sound.

The strategy for racing itself is not much different, except the race is in a linear fashion of point A-to-B.&amp;#xA;In Scramble Races the player roars around an area &quot;collecting&quot; checkpoints in a random location as fast as possible.

  <plot>Test Drive Unlimited lets the player choose one of several characters, both male and female, waiting at an airport to check in for their flight to the Caribbean dream island O&apos;ahu located in Hawaii. The characters do not have different statistics, that only applies to the extravagant, licensed cars.&amp;#xA;The whole island is accessible from the beginning and after the player has bought his first home and car, he can either drive around and look for events or load up the map and jump directly to a location of a race, a car salesman or other locations - similar to Need for Speed Underground. Every bought car has a built-in navigation system, guided by a woman&apos;s voice to get the player to his destination, either pre-programmed in the game or decided by the player.&amp;#xA;There are over 125 different cars and motorcycles in different price ranges to choose from. From the Audi TT over the Jaguar XJ200 to the McLaren F1 and Kawasaki Z1000, there is everything the character needs as a young man or girl with too much money on their hands. Each car has its own, realistic set of characteristics such as speed or handling, but they all have a highly detailed exterior and interior in common.&amp;#xA;The character starts with $200.000 dollars in his pocket, but there will not be anything left after buying a first car and home. Additional cash needs to be earned in different kinds of races from checkpoint challenges to time trials. The money cannot only be used to buy new homes and new cars (and a little tuning for those), but also to buy new outfits for the avatar.&amp;#xA;The heart of Test Drive Unlimited is the online mode. Using a GameSpy account, players connect to the official TDU server immediately after loading the game. New options become available online, such as a meeting lounge where the statistics and looks of other players can be looked up. It also provides access to player-created matches shown on the map screen. Creating a race here also works in the singleplayer modes. At any location, the start and finish can be defined, as well as the type of the race, which type/classes of cars or bikes are allowed and how many people can participate. If not all slots have been filled up by other players, the AI will take control of the rest.&amp;#xA;The PSP and PS2 versions have a lower visual quality and lack a few features, such as manual transmission, avatar customization, certain cars and all motorcycles, dealership and tuning shop NPCs, the vehicle interior camera angle and certain missions. They do include Master Points and Auto GPS, and certain default vehicles only available for the 360 version through download packs.</plot>

The only way to stop him is to keep the parks running smoothly, this involves keeping the guests happy and finding out their needs and wants.&amp;#xA;Created by the team behind RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, the game moves away from pure management for the console systems.

  <plot>This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts&apos; Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise. Although the game&apos;s features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.&amp;#xA;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.&amp;#xA;PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.</plot>

Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.&amp;#xA;The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball&apos;s path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player&apos;s performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.&amp;#xA;The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).&amp;#xA;On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.</plot>

  <plot>Crisis Zone for the PlayStation 2 is a port of the arcade game of the same name, and it is a spin-off from the Time Crisis series. In the game you are part of an elite anti-terrorist group called Special Tactical Force and you are sent to fight a terrorist group called U.R.D.A.&amp;#xA;The terrorist group has taken over an office center and wants to destroy the nuclear reactor buried deep beneath the complex.&amp;#xA;It&apos;s up to you, to stop them.&amp;#xA;The game play is like the rest of the series, where you are taking cover, trying to eliminate the enemies in a small area before a limited amount of time expires, with the time limit resetting when you finish the area and proceed to the next one. You don&apos;t control the player&apos;s movement as it is a rail shooter, meaning that your character moves in a pre-determined path, with enemies jumping in the screen to try and damage you. Hide behind your shield to avoid being shot, but you are also not able to shoot while behind it.&amp;#xA;The PS2 port can use the G-con 45 and G-Con2 light guns (with the last one being bundled sometimes with the game). Another different of the PS2 port from the arcade one is that the port features an extra mission (Grassmarket District that takes place 6 months after the Garland Square mission in which you have to rescue the daughter of S.T.F. Commander Kessler and clear the district from the remaining terrorists), along with some small minigames.</plot>

Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements.&amp;#xA;Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously.&amp;#xA;Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120).&amp;#xA;The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI &quot;bots&quot; can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.</plot>

  <plot>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York. A mysterious figure calling himself the &quot;Nightwatcher&quot; has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!&amp;#xA;TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle. Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights. Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York. Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.&amp;#xA;Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you&apos;ll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on. Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away. If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack. Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his &apos;rage&apos; builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged. The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.&amp;#xA;The basic goal for each level is to get to the end. At the end of each level, you&apos;re graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected. In levels where you work with your brothers, you&apos;ll also be graded on how well you worked together. Succeed in a these attributes, and you&apos;ll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables. If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you&apos;ll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins. Finally, once you&apos;ve played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.</plot>

Aside from singleplayer campaigns, game also features split screen play and several different multiplayer modes for online play.&amp;#xA;The game also includes Tom Clancy&apos;s Ghost Recon: Island Thunder campaign just to encompass the conflict and give players what was amiss for PlayStation 2 before. Controlling Alpha and Bravo teams of three-by-three, you are now able to give commands to both of your teams via USB headset while fighting first-hand through the use of a gamepad. Voice-recognition supports about 50 different commands given in a way of concatenation WHO+WHAT+WHERE (e.g. Alpha Team Take Cover, or All Teams Attack Objective 2).</plot>

  <plot>Lockdown is the third Rainbow Six game to appear on the consoles, this time with Red Storm Entertainment fully behind the wheel. Once again, you play as Domingo &apos;Ding&apos; Chavez, leading a small commando team on black-ops missions. This time, however, the developer strays from the realistic squad-based action in favor of more arcadish gameplay. The main single player campaign is based around a dangerous virus and hostages. In certain missions, you play as sniper Dieter Weber, picking off terrorists from higher ground and providing cover while the team infiltrates the building.&amp;#xA;The differences between the console versions are the number of missions and the availability of certain gadgets. There is an offline two-player, split-screen cooperative mode available (up to 4 over Xbox live) and full online multiplayer up to 16 players featuring traditional deathmatch, objective-based games and CTF modes, on Xbox and PS2. While the PS2 version includes a Rivalry mode, Xbox online multiplayer has an RPG element: the P.E.C. mode (Persistent Elite Creation). Before playing, you choose an avatar and a class with specific abilities (commando, engineer, spec op and medic). While playing, you earn credits and experience, which can be traded in for new weapons, items or amour. Gear regularly needs to be repaired, shown by the durability level, and experience can be used to assign skills points to abilities, individualizing your character.</plot>

  <plot>In 2007, an unidentified group of terrorists attack a number of high-profile targets, beginning with the G8 summit in Switzerland and continuing with a Venezuelan oil refinery in the Caribbean. Their demands are obviously targeted at disrupting the oil trade between the United States and Venezuela. Enter veteran international anti-terrorism unit Team Rainbow, who must stop the terrorists and discover who is behind the attacks. Rainbow Six 3 is an entry in the long-running series designed especially for consoles. It does away with the heavy strategy and planning elements the series was known for on the PC and offers an experience more focused on the first-person action. The game features 14 single-player levels (15 in the PS2 and GameCube versions). In each, the player controls Domingo &apos;Ding&apos; Chavez, who leads a team of three other Rainbow operatives. Goals in each mission include taking out terrorists, defusing bombs and protecting hostages. Ding&apos;s squad mates will act on their own in supporting the mission, but they can also be given specific orders through a context-sensitive menu: holding position, advancing, clearing a room or defusing a bomb. It&apos;s also possible to give delayed orders which are only carried out once a special signal is given. The Xbox version features voice recognition: team orders can be given through a headset. Before each mission, each squad member must be equipped with a primary and secondary weapon plus further equipment. More than two dozen realistic firearms are available, and there are also different types of grenades (hand-thrown or fired through a launcher), charges and mines, as well as a gas mask. Thermal and night vision are always available and don&apos;t require special equipment. Despite the action focus, the game still opts for a certain amount of realism: there is no running or jumping, more than a few hits are fatal and there is no way to regain lost health. Besides the single player campaign, there is also the custom mission mode, which allows the player to hunt terrorists on unlocked maps from the campaign. </plot>

  <plot>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan&apos;s constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.&amp;#xA;In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.&amp;#xA;The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a &amp;quot;tunnel&amp;quot; like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they&apos;d like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.&amp;#xA;Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.&amp;#xA;The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.</plot>

In order to star one step ahead of its target, Third Echelon is also changing and while Sam Fisher&apos;s foes are evolving and his allies are in flux, Fisher&apos;s own life will undergo some dramatic and permanent changes. And once that happens nothing will ever be the same.&amp;#xA;With his life turned upside down, Fisher is on a new mission unlike any he has ever been sent on before. Where he used to penetrate defenses and gather information from the outside, now he is on the inside, working with those he has sworn to destroy and finding enemies among his allies. He is risking everything for the sake of the greater good, even if it costs him his identity or his life.&amp;#xA;Play the game in a stealth manner or in a gun blazing way and your experience will be different every time you play. Try to sneak around the enemies and kill, interrogate or neutralize them without anyone else notice. There are 3 different endings depending on your choices in the game. Different settings will be visited during the game such as a prison, a boat in Cozumel, visit Africa, and many more.&amp;#xA;You will get many different weapons and gadgets to help you through your journey. Use gadgets to close the lights, use gadget to electrify enemies in water pond, and scan the surroundings using your many visions (electric, night vision, heat vision) to identify potential gameplay objects around the worlds.&amp;#xA;This version is quite different from the Xbox 360/Windows release. They share the same engine (although it is not multi-threaded), but this release adds an additional single-player mission with alternate ending, a new Spies vs. Spies online mode, 14 co-op missions playable offline (also online for the Xbox version), LAN, and 8 minutes of additional cinematics. There are also some changes in the storyline. The Wii/GameCube versions only have co-op multiplayer.&amp;#xA;The Spies vs. Spies multiplayer offers different game modes:&amp;#xA;1.

Team Deathmatch: regular team matches.&amp;#xA;4. Key Run: similar to Team Hack, but with the addition of a key that needs to be obtained first to hack into the opponent&apos;s computer&amp;#xA;5.

He makes daily phone calls to an undisclosed location every day, delaying the release of the disease by one more day. As Fisher, you must find out who the terrorist is, where he is, who he is working for, and above all, stop him.&amp;#xA;In order to do this, you are taken all around the world, from Paris to Indonesia to the holy land Jerusalem. Sam comes equipped with his standard pistol and SC-20K. The SC has been improved, with an added scope with two levels of zoom. You have access to all the equipment from the first game, including Sticky Shockers, Diversion Cameras, Frag and Smoke Grenades.&amp;#xA;Sam has also learned some new moves. He has the ability to perform a SWAT turn, which allows him to pass from one side of an open door to the other without being spotted. He may perform a half-split jump, enabling him to lean against one side of a wall to give him boost to jump higher. He can also whistle, to attract the attention of any nearby enemies.&amp;#xA;Pandora Tomorrow also has a full fledged multiplayer game, playable on Xbox Live. The multiplayer ties in to the single player campaign, and it pits the Shadownet team (spies) against the Argus team (mercs). The game supports four players.&amp;#xA;Members of Shadownet must infiltrate various complexes to retrieve canisters of a deadly liquid, but they must watch out for cameras, motion sensors and trip lasers, all of which alert the mercs to their position. The spy cannot kill with weapons, but he can stun the mercs for several seconds in order to sneak up and kill from behind.&amp;#xA;On the other side, the mercs must make their way to each canister, guarding it from the Shadownet team. Whenever an alarm is tripped, the merc is instantly alerted to where the spy is. To help fight the Shadownets, the mercs have a built-in motion sensor view, which picks up any moving objects, as well as an electromagnetic view, which picks up on spy gadgets. The mercs come equipped with a rifle, and must defend the viral canisters at all costs.&amp;#xA;Multiplayer comes with a good variety of maps, ranging from a warehouse and a factory to a cinema and three towering skyscrapers. More maps will be available in the future via Xbox Live.</plot>

  <plot>In Splinter Cell, you take on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization Third Echelon.&amp;#xA;SC is a third-person stealth based game, similar to Metal Gear Solid. Third Echelon is a secret organization, a part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, and you play as Sam, Third Echelon&apos;s &quot;splinter cell&quot;. Your missions are so discreet, that if you are captured, the government will deny any such existence of that organization.&amp;#xA;Since it&apos;s a stealth based game, you have a variety of moves at your disposal. You can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump.&amp;#xA;To defeat your enemies, you have a variety of means. You can use your weapons, but the noise might alert a guard. You can stun them, kill them, subdue them, jump down from the ceiling and knock them unconcious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode, so you can take an enemy hostage by holding a gun to his head, you can interrogate them, or you can use them as human shields.&amp;#xA;Some of the more innovative features of the game is the ability to peak through a door before going through. You can open it up a bit to peak through, or you can use your optic cable camera (a &quot;snake&quot; camera) to peer through the underside of the door, checking to make sure it&apos;s clear.&amp;#xA;Being a stealth based game, your arsenal is small. You have an automatic rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and you also have a trusty pistol.&amp;#xA;Splinter Cell also has downloadable content, so you can download new items in the future, specifically new levels and missions.</plot>

Since her father already searched for this item, Lara does not hesitate and begins her journey through ancient tombs and forgotten worlds.&amp;#xA;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is essentially a remake of the original Tomb Raider. So you fight and riddle your way through familiar sites and meet good old enemies. But also you feel at home, the game features everything that Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend has. So besides the better graphics, Lara also has many new moves, such as swinging on ropes, bullet time when an animal rushes towards her, and the addition of a grappling hook in her inventory (which resembles the one from the original game). Jumping is also a lot easier, as the heroine automatically grabs the ledges without requiring pixel-precise timing. There are also completely new moves, where Lara balances and jumps on small sticks.&amp;#xA;The cut-scenes are identical, but rendered in real-time using the new engine. Some are also action-based, like in the previous games, requiring quick reflexes to keep the action going. The environments and riddles have been changed to fit the new gameplay and the voice recording was also redone.</plot>

  <plot>Legend is the seventh major game in the Tomb Raider series, now for the first time developed by Crystal Dynamics, along with the original character designer of the game&apos;s protagonist Lara Croft: Toby Gard.&amp;#xA;Heroine Lara is searching for a South American relic, but her adventure takes a different course when rogue anthropologist Amanda Evert shows up. Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara&apos;s past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden.&amp;#xA;The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip.&amp;#xA;Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location.&amp;#xA;The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode: Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.</plot>

  <plot>Tomb Raider: Underworld concludes the story of Lara&apos;s search for her mother who is supposedly trapped in a place called Avalon. Continuing the events from Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary, her search brings her once again to locations around the globe from the cold wastes of the Arctic to the beautiful landscapes of Thailand. This time even the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea is not save from Lara&apos;s exploring. At the same time the game continues to explore the idea of monomyth, this time incorporating the influences of the Norse mythology into its narrative.&amp;#xA;The basic gameplay remains the same as in most of the previous iterations of the series with the focus on exploring, solving riddles and dodgy climbing passages instead of instant action and gun fights. For this Lara once again learned a few new moves including jumping between the walls introduced in Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time.&amp;#xA;To help the players with the riddles, the game not only features a sonar map, showing Lara&apos;s immediate surroundings as a 3D grid for better orientation around the levels. Also, if asked, Lara gives general but helpful tips on what to do next.&amp;#xA;The differences from the previous Tomb Raider games developed by Crystal Dynamics include the complete lack of QTE events. Instead the time slows down in critical moments, but the player still retains full control of the Lara&apos;s movements. Another change is the more non-linear level design more in vein with the traditional entries of the series.</plot>

Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.&amp;#xA;All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.&amp;#xA;The levels are been expanded and are huge.

  <plot>The fifth game in the series, Tony Hawk&apos;s Underground is the first game to have a true career mode.&amp;#xA;You begin the game as a local skater whom nobody knows. Your board is wearing thin, and your tired of being a nobody. As your out skating, you see a flyer for a pro who&apos;s coming to your city to demo. You go to the skate demo and watch. Afterwards, you try to impress the pro, and he gives you advice on how to go about becoming a star. With your friend, Eric, you&apos;re now on your way to becoming a legend.&amp;#xA;THUG takes you to various cities to perform different goals. You begin in New Jersey, which acts as a sort of training stage, where goals are simple. Eventually, you&apos;ll visit Manhattan, Vancouver, Moscow, Tampa, San Diego and Hawaii. Most cities are split into different chapters, with each chapter opening new goals.&amp;#xA;THUG introduces a new system; walking. You can get off your skateboard to run or walk around the level. If there&apos;s a high tower you want to jump off of, get off your board, climb to the tower (by climbing a ladder or shuffling across a wire), get back on your board, and jump down. One of the new tricks associated with this is the Acid Drop, which can launch you off an opposing pipe, allowing you to pull off 1080&apos;s and up.&amp;#xA;Also new to THUG is the ability to drive certain vehicles, like a gardener&apos;s truck, a sports car, or a leaf blower. These are used for goals, but can be unlocked to drive whenever and wherever.&amp;#xA;Next to the standard Create-a-Park and Create-a-Skater, you can now create your own decks and your own tricks. The biggest feature is Create-a-Goal. You can create custom goals for one of the levels (or your own), and choose what pedestrian will give it to you, his/her dialogue, and what they&apos;ll say when you win.&amp;#xA;The PlayStation 2 version supports online play.</plot>

  <plot>Torino 2006 is the official game of the XX Winter Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy, and the eight in the line of multi-event IOC licensed titles. The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and 1500m), Women&apos;s Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens&apos; 2 and Mens&apos; 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues were modelled after their real counterparts.&amp;#xA;Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine that power Ski Alpin 2006, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen: on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or mean losing a medal.&amp;#xA;Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes&apos; balance for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion.&amp;#xA;Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of the aim affected by the fatigue levels.&amp;#xA;Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each step.&amp;#xA;Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences: The startup in Bobsled is done by following the on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it&apos;s also possible to make minimal path changes. The winner is the fastest competitor after two heats (instead of the official four).&amp;#xA;Nordic Combined is a Large hill ski jump which sets the start time for each competitor in the Cross country section.&amp;#xA;It&apos;s possible to compete in all 15 or just 9 events, or even create your own competition, with up to four competitors. At each competition the players aim for both medals and the score table, based on the results on each individual event. However, the challenge does not stop with winning medals. The player can unlock additional strips by completing challenges, such as hitting all 10 targets in Biathlon, having a perfect Bobsled start, winning a gold medal and beat each top record on every event or not missing a single step on Speed Skating. The difficulty level affects events differently: in Alpine skiing, it means CPU-controlled players are faster and fewer gate misses are allowed, in Ski jump wind can appear from any direction and in Speed skating, in addition to set the pace, the player also has to steer the athlete to keep her in the best path.</plot>

This is reflected in-game by giving you control over your rider&apos;s side-to-side leaning to affect cornering.

Arcade mode allows you to do timed runs, quick races against AI opponents or split-screen racing.&amp;#xA;The main mode, Tourist Trophy, first puts you through a series of licensing tests. Each license opens up a group of challenges or races. Each challenge or race corresponds to a motorcycle, which you can earn by winning it. There is no cash in this game. Some events also unlock further events, of course.&amp;#xA;Bikes are customizable. You can set the tire compound, brakes, shocks, gear ratio and exhaust. Riders have even more options. Not only can they wear a variety of licensed clothing, their riding style is customizable, allowing you to adjust things like the position they take in leans, which affects handling.&amp;#xA;In addition to these Tourist Trophy also features a photography mode, which allows you to take pictures of the game in action and save them to a USB flash drive or print them directly from a printer attached to your PlayStation 2.</plot>

  <plot>Based on the 2007 movie, Transformers: The Game puts players in the role of either the Autobot or Decepticon factions in an attempt to find the AllSpark, the artifact which gave life to their race. The Autobots intend to protect it for good, while the Decepticons desire its power for evil. The two factions fought their battle on the planet Cybertron, but in an ultimate attempt to protect it, the Autobots hurled the AllSpark into space where it remained hidden on Earth. When the Decepticons discover the location, they want to finish the war on Earth.&amp;#xA;Set in a 3D sandbox environment with possibilities to interact and destroy the environment, players can choose between the two teams, each with different story-based goals. These are set on different locations, with primary and secondary quests. The storyline for the heroic Autobots follows the plot and events of the original movie. The storyline for the villainous Decepticons, however, allows the robots to destroy both the planet and more aggressively bring an end to their foes. Players can choose characters such as Optimus Prime or Bumblebee from the list of selectable Autobots, or Megatron and Starscream from the Decepticons.&amp;#xA;Shown from a third-person perspective, the robots can switch between a robot and a vehicle/aircraft form, jump, block, dive underground, roll, dodge, use various weapons, and climb buildings. Special actions can be unlocked through the skill tracker. By performing long slides or jumps, symbols in the tracker will light up and provide extras.&amp;#xA;Along the way, various collectibles can be found, ranging from promo images and artwork, to playable versions of the original &quot;Generation 1&quot; characters. The general gameplay is identical across the different platforms, but certain features are tied to specific versions.</plot>

  <plot>On the planet of Cybertron, the Transformer war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons rages on. But the losses are mounting up, and the war&apos;s front has been pushed into the heart of Autobot territory. The Autobots&apos; last stand takes a turn for the worse when the Decepticons introduce their secret weapon: the new Decepticlone army.&amp;#xA;As if by fate, a distress signal from the Mini-Cons, the long-lost third Transformer race, blasts onto the battlefield.

  <plot>In Trapt, the player takes on the role of Princess Allura, horrified by the sudden murder of her father the King of Fronenburg and worse, being framed for his murder by step mother - Queen Catalina, later forced unwillingly to flee the castle with her maid Rachel.&amp;#xA;Fleeing her pursuers, she takes refuge in a forbidden castle, known through rumors as the place where an evil being only known as &quot;the Fiend&quot; was imprisoned. It was not by coincidence she was led here, as it turns out she was chosen by the Fiend to become her servant and wielder of the evil power the Fiend possesses. This power transforms the once innocent princess into a brutal &quot;Trapmaster&quot; capable of summoning and activating traps at will to the unwary enemy.&amp;#xA;The game starts in this castle and the unfolding of this new-found power as well as the attempts of Princess Allura and her allies in thwarting the plans of Queen Catalina.&amp;#xA;Trapt set is in medieval Europe of which, most of the game play is located in and around castle rooms, though not specifically limited to the aforementioned castle. Gameplay of Trapt consists the following:&amp;#xA;1. Traps/Info Screen&amp;#xA;In this section the player has access to various important information to prepare for the upcoming mission/story, such as traps and items that may be bought (providing you have enough money), upcoming enemies and their stats in the next mission, and room information of areas available for access in addition to what traps are already located there.&amp;#xA;Real-Time Combat&amp;#xA;This is where the real game play occurs, 3rd person perspective view of the character and her surroundings. Most of the game play consists killing off enemies by placing traps to the unwary pursuer. The Princess cannot fight personally (only run) so the player has to rely on the traps to survive.&amp;#xA;Unlike other similar games with a trap system, in Trapt the traps are not automatically set. The player have to activate them manually by pressing the appropriate triggers (via buttons) to activate the traps. The 3 different button/triggers represent 3 different traps: Floor traps, Ceiling traps, and Wall traps. These are the only traps the player has direct access to.&amp;#xA;Other traps or devices are also located in the many rooms. The player can &quot;link/connect&quot; them with other traps to create combos at the displeasure of the enemy. The more combo&apos;s, the more money the player acquires, of which means the more traps the player can purchase for future planning.&amp;#xA;Placing traps can be done at any point during this real-time setting, which is basically the uniqueness of your powers. This means you can move and place traps around, even when the enemy is chasing you. However, traps have to recharge: after it is placed and after it is sprung, so timing is also crucial here.</plot>

The game&apos;s soundtrack consists of techno/gothic music, with some industrial, and acoustic guitar bits, especially the ending credits, &quot;Paint It Black.</plot>

  <plot>This is a conversion of the PSP version of Twisted Metal: Head-On, but with some differences. One of the changes is the inclusion of four lost levels of a new Twisted Metal game that was never finished (it was cancelled after six members of the production team died in a plane crash). It features the characters from Twisted Metal: Black, but with new stories (unfortunately, no endings were done for them) and two extra characters, 12-Pak and Gold Tooth. The levels are a massive suburban area, a giant stadium, a local carnival and a ship yard.&amp;#xA;Another feature is the ability to walk around in an asylum as Sweet Tooth, a feature that was being worked on for the new Twisted Metal that was going to be used for character based foot missions. In it you can roam the asylum and collect Sweet Tooth shaped heads that include facts about the history of the Twisted Metal series.&amp;#xA;Includes documentaries of the history of Twisted Metal and live action videos of endings for the original Twisted Metal on the Playstation that looks like old, worn out videotape, some of which have completely different endings from the final versions, even making Sweet Tooth sound almost like Mick &quot;Mankind&quot; Foley of WWE/WWF fame.</plot>

  <plot>TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is a 3D Platformer with an Australian theme. The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY&apos;s quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at.&amp;#xA;While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.).&amp;#xA;There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident.

It&apos;s up to Ty to reunite his team members, as well as stop the Quinkan from unleashing the mysterious Quinking, an evil being of supreme power.&amp;#xA;Night of the Quinkan is the third game in the Ty series.

Boomerangs can be customized in an assortment of ways: either by changing the chassis (each chassis has its own special abilities); or by equipping special Bunyip Stones to the boomerang&apos;s chassis. Some stones can be combined with others, allowing players to customize their attacks to their liking. Some stones are rewards for completing tasks; others, as well as boomerang chassis, can be purchased from the Rang Shop in exchange for Opals, the game&apos;s currency.&amp;#xA;Ty 3 again rolls out the robotic mechs - choose from the Shadow or Extreme Bunyip (your standard mech), the Crabmersible (a submarine shaped like a crab, oddly enough), or the Gunyip (a speedy airplane with an assortment of bombs and guns).

  <plot>After many years under Eidos/Silicon Dreams ownership and development, EA releases the official Champions League game for the 2004/2005 season.&amp;#xA;The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it&apos;s gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes), advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized &quot;targeting&quot; and &quot;push and shove&quot; featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal.&amp;#xA;Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future&apos;s FIFA Manager.&amp;#xA;The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players.&amp;#xA;The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the &quot;The Season&quot; mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final. This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, &quot;home and away&quot; (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.</plot>

The questions are, obviously, based on films and television and there are four game modes:•Super Star: In this mode the game is played over three rounds of eight questions. The winner is the player with the most points and players each have two &apos;jokers&apos; to remove a wrong answer • Play or Pass: This is also played over three eight question rounds. Players have three lives and lose a life with each incorrect answer, they also have one joker per round which they can use to pass a tough question on to an opponent. If a player answers their question correctly they can select which opponent is asked the next question. • Shoot Out: A quick on the button round where questions are not addressed in turn to each player • Quiz Trilogy: This consists of one round from each of the above quiz modes. All quiz modes have three eight question rounds and the right answer is not given when a question is answered incorrectly. All questions are asked in &apos;teleprompter&apos; style, i.e. they are &apos;typed out&apos; on screen to the accompaniment of a clacking sound, and they are all multiple choice with four possible answers to choose from. The game has no &apos;high score&apos; table to record how many times a player wins nor does it have any movie/TV clips or soundbytes. This game is a little unusual in that players share controllers, players one and two share controller one with player one using the Cross,Square, Triangle, Circle buttons while player two answers the questions using the D-Pad buttons.

  <plot>An alien called Cosmi got stuck on earth after his spaceship crashed on a satellite. The only way he can return home is by gaining enough money to repair his spaceship. Unfortunately for the humans, the only way Cosmi can obtain money is by causing panic amongst them.&amp;#xA;The player takes the role of Cosmi and can use several different weapons and gadgets to scare away the humans. You can launch a giant bowling ball, a cannon or a karaoke set to terrify the people with your awful singing. To obtain new weapons you have to scan the DNA of humans walking the streets, each having their own set of abilities. When you scare humans enough, they drop coins. Getting enough coins completes a level and ultimately, the game.&amp;#xA;Under the Skin brings you to different locations, including Raccoon City, the place where the Resident Evil games take place. In that level you battle the ultimate foe Nemesis, who this time is entirely cel-shaded, just like the rest of the game.</plot>

  <plot>Unlimited SaGa is a sequel to Square&apos;s famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower.&amp;#xA;&quot;Unlimited SaGa&quot; feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character&apos;s special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.</plot>

  <plot>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it&apos;s now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3.&amp;#xA;At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team&apos;s score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team&apos;s flag to score a point.&amp;#xA;The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it&apos;s called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.&amp;#xA;All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</plot>

After his wife dies he gets depressed but finally decides to experience adventures after all. He gets accompanied by the scout Russel.&amp;#xA;Most levels are played with two characters with different abilities: Carl can use his walking aid as jumping help and crowbar while Russel balances on small ledges, catches insects or blinds enemies with his magnifying glass. Sometimes the dog Dug joins them who can pass through small holes and swim. The levels are basic platforming stages with many puzzles which need all these abilities to be solved. Of course this can be played in co-op too. Diversion is brought by a few flying levels with a biplane.&amp;#xA;There are numerous differences to the Xbox 360/Playstation 3/Wii version. There are more levels, additional mini games like a raft trip where the player has to dodge crocodiles, the story is told with actual cutscenes from the movie and there are more unlockable extras, e.g. cheats. The two player characters gain additional gadgets during the game which can be used to reach new areas in already beaten levels. The multiplayer modes are also different: this version lacks the simultaneous flying duels for four players but two variants for two players and six other mini games which can be player as tournament for four players.</plot>

However, Silmeria manages to retain her consciousness and shares the body with Alicia, leading her father, King Barbarossa, to believe that she is possessed. As a result, he fakes her death and banishes her to a faraway land. When Odin learns of Silmeria&apos;s actions, he sends the third valkyrie, Hrist, to find Alicia and to bring Silmeria back to Asgard. In the meantime, Alicia and Silmeria seek the legendary Dragon Orb, an artifact that would allow them to be free from Odin forever.&amp;#xA;Although the game retains the side-scrolling aspect of the first Valkyrie Profile while traversing through dungeons or other locations, the second installment is rendered in three-dimensions throughout. The game takes advantage of this during the battle sequences as you must move and position your characters correctly to perform attacks.

  <plot>Virtua Cop: Elite Edition is a combination of Virtua Cop 1 &amp; 2.&amp;#xA;You play a cop who has been called out to deal with a certain situation, armed with your trusty sidearm. Enemies pop out from behind most objects and a reticule lights up around them to let you know they are armed and dangerous. You have to have quick reflexes as innocent people pop up which need to be protected.&amp;#xA;There are 6 levels in all, 3 from each game and these levels have multiple stages. With the three difficulty levels on offer, along with the modifications you can make in the options setup such as the number of continues and auto reload and taking off the enemy indicator, you can make the game as difficult or as easy as you wish. There are multiple paths on some levels so there is some incentive to replay the levels.&amp;#xA;There is a 2 player co-operative mode which can still be played with two light guns or you can use the Dual Shock pad. Training is also available. Even though this an old Sega Saturn game, it hasn&apos;t been improved much for the PS2 so expect a smoother gameplay of the older graphics.</plot>

  <plot>Virtua Pro Football is Sega&apos;s attempt to compete with the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. It&apos;s more similar to those than the more arcade based games in the Virtua Striker series. Controls work as can be expected and include short and long passes, crosses, shots and different defence options. The game features a special one on one mode where offensive players can challenge and dribble past a defender. The camera then zooms in to a behind the shoulder perspective of the dribbler and the player can do different stick and button combinations to get past the defender. Some of the movement options that are possible are lunge, feint and nutmeg. The game features over 250 teams in twelve leagues (including three licensed ones; Dutch Eredivisie and Gouden Gids Divisie and Spanish LFP Primera Division). Competitions that the player can compete in are domestic leagues, club cups, international cup and custom leagues and cups. More unique is the player mode where the player gets to create and develop his own footballer. For each week the player can choose between practice, rest and going out. Practice is done through different mini games and by playing these the different skills will increase but so does the risk for injuries. Therefore rest is also needed at times. Going out means interacting with different people at various places and is needed to become more known to the supporters and the public. It&apos;s also possible to buy stuff, both football items and luxury items. Part of the player mode is also various events such as comments from the coach, meetings with the press and contract negotiations. The game also features a play book mode where the player can create his own tactics for set pieces. Teams created in Sega&apos;s other football game, Let&apos;s Make A Soccer Team! can be imported into Virtua Pro Football. </plot>

  <plot>Virtua Quest is a 3D Action/RPG that features both core RPG elements (exploration, treasure gathering and character development) and a strong fighting component. The player assumes the identity of a young boy named Sei (pronounced &quot;Say&quot;). As the player explores each stage, he/she will discover &quot;Virtua Souls&quot; data clusters that contain information about the martial arts abilities of the legendary Virtua Fighter characters. These clusters give the player the ability to easily perform complex fighting moves. As the game&apos;s story progresses, Sei discovers that only he can unlock the potential of the Virtua Souls, and he subsequently gains the attention of an evil syndicate known as Judgment 6. Judgment 6, in a mad bid for power, pursues Sei, attempting to force upon him its dirty work in hopes of bringing down the infrastructure of a vast virtual world. If it succeeds, the arbiters of justice and power in the real world will come crumbling down, and anarchy will reign. Sei&apos;s inner strength is put to the test as he fights to keep this from happening.</plot>

During the game, the player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission. Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or worse.&amp;#xA;During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other gangs&apos; burners, and load up on flash. Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches.&amp;#xA;The game plays like a squad-based brawler. Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game environment can be weaponized. Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option. Players can perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles.

  <plot>After the success of Katamari Damacy, the King of all Cosmos and his son, the Prince, have gained quite a bit of fame. To keep all of the fans happy, the Prince is once again sent to Earth to roll stuff up with a katamari (a clump of stuff); this time he&apos;s taking requests from the fans as to what should be rolled up!&amp;#xA;The gameplay is the same as in Katamari Damacy; using both of the analog sticks you can push the katamari around. When the katamari runs over an object that is small enough, it will stick causing the katamari to grow in size. As the katamari grows, you&apos;ll be able to roll up increasingly larger objects. There are a variety of different objectives that need to be completed; some tasks will have you rolling up as much as you can within a time limit, others may have you rolling up a fixed number of objects as fast as can, and sometimes certain objects need to be avoided. Most of the missions take place in a large settings: such as a series of rooms, an open park and even complete cities. Special settings require the prince to roll up clouds to bring back the sun, or to collect lights so a young man can study.&amp;#xA;As the katamari rolls around, it can pick up almost anything; umbrellas, desks, erasers, pencils, batteries, plants, beach balls, tea kettles, fences, assorted animals, people, buildings, trees, mountains, cars, and many other objects. Between levels there are short-cut scenes providing some back story on the Prince and the King of all Cosmos. All missions start from the meadow, a central location where animals and people call for help. The prince can choose to accept the mission or look for something else. Upon completion, the prince returns to the king and the katamari is sent into space as a planet, or as stardust when there already is a better or larger planet available.&amp;#xA;To the end the game, the prince is transported to the cosmos to roll up all the planets and finally roll up the sun. In the meadow, players can view presents, rankings, collections, and change general options or save/restore a game. The game features all new unusual songs as well as a new two-player mode. The visuals are very bright, with unusual characters and conversations.</plot>

Frivolous honking and cutting off other road users are his trademark. In White Van Racer, players are given the chance to turn the tables on this modern-day phenomenon, and become a White Van Man of their own. Selectable vans range from nondescript models to ice cream trucks, mobile burger shops, or business vehicles for painters and window cleaners. While there is no civilian traffic on the roads, drivers compete against up to 4 other computer-controlled vans in a dash for the finish line. There is a total of 12 linear stages, set in 2 scenarios and consisting of variations (direction, time of day) on 4 basic road sections. True to the White Van Man disposition, pushing and shoving competitors is a necessary tactic for the successful driver.

  <plot>In ancient times, a war was fought against demons on a world named Filgara. The planet bears the scars of this encounter as much of the world is barren and the ocean has turned to sand. For different reasons, four characters set out to become &quot;drifters&quot; and make their own path over the plains. Virginia Maxwell chose this trip on a steam train because she was bored by the monotonous life in a sleepy village and wanted to explore the world. Treasure-hunter Jet Enduro thinks the train will bring him to a place where a flower with magic powers can be found. Gallows Caradine is a shaman of his tribe and is the guardian of a sacred artifact. Clive Winslet is a cynical archaeologist and part-time bounty hunter. A fateful encounter aboard a train will bring these four together and mix them up in the doings of a mysterious organization of scientists. This Council of Seven once was formed to renew the life force of Filgara, but now seems to be harnessing it for their own means.&amp;#xA;This third installment of the Wild Arms series continues the tradition of two previous games, adding a stronger emphasis on the (fantasy) Wild West atmosphere. Characters have the ability to attack using ARMS (projectile weapons), use special abilities, use items or cast Arcana (magic). From the beginning of the game, each of the four characters has an introductory chapter before becoming a party and traveling together. The battles are random, with a FP gauge which fills while attacking and defending, and usage of Arms and magic which require FP, similar to the second game of the series. Later on, special vehicles feature their own type of battle system. Other similarities to previous Wild arms games include the search system (towns and dungeons are not indicated on the map until you discover them), the ability to cancel a random battle and special abilities used outside of battles to solve puzzles. An interesting innovation is a dialogue based on key words, similar to a system commonly used in adventure games, which allows a more flexible use of dialogue options.</plot>

  <plot>WipEout Pulse is the second game in the WipEout series to be released on the PSP. Just like the other titles in the series, it is a futuristic racing games where players control a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above the ground and can reach very high speeds. The game is set in 2207 where players take part in the FX400 Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world.&amp;#xA;The vehicles are divided over different teams (twelve including downloads), each with their own characteristics based on handling, speed, acceleration and more. While racing, moving over pads provides boosts or both offensive and defensive power-ups such as shields, rockets, a wall of fire, autopilot, a gun or a turbo boost. Instead of using weapons, they can now also be absorbed to restore the energy levels. A single button is used to accelerate, with regular steering and also air brakes for sharp corners. The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series.&amp;#xA;The base game consists of twelve tracks, but these can be driven in both directions (designated by black or white in the title name). New to the track design are waterfall-like drops, loops and corkscrews. At certain section the vehicle is glued to the track to pass these. Entirely new to the series is the revamped progression system. As usual, new tracks and faster models need to be unlocked by winning races, but instead of a linear model these are now grouped as hexagon-clustered grids with different modes of play. When available, players can choose any of the sections to participate in a time trial, single race, head-to-head, eliminator games (returning from Wipeout 3) and Zone games (introduced in WipEout Fusion) where the vehicle constantly accelerates and transforms into faster models until all health is depleted. A certain amount of races need to be won to access a new grid, but using this system some difficult races can be avoided or ignored. In all races the vehicles are destroyed when all energy is depleted. Based on the performance a bronze, silver or gold medal is awarded and there are three difficulty settings.&amp;#xA;Using the vehicle of a certain team regularly is awarded with a loyalty system. The game supports game sharing and multiplayer modes using both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure as access. Up to 30 mp3 files can be loaded on a memory stick to use as the in-game soundtrack, there is photo mode to take screenshots during replays and on the game&apos;s official website players can design their own car skins using a flash client to use in the game. As with the previous games, there are many expansion packs that introduce new teams and tracks.</plot>

The game is for the most part a simulation of real-life racing, with a strong career mode and a number of customization options. There are also elements to it that make it accessible to those who are looking to try something new, but overall, this is a game that is aimed directly at sprint car racing fans. As such, the developmental focus was clearly on the gameplay, seemingly at the expense of the audio and visual aspects of the game.</plot>

Now, the match feels more real to the actual play as players make mistakes more often and passes don&apos;t go too well if the player is on the wrong foot, or makes a bad turn. The new gameplay may require slight adjustment for players to switch from older versions to this one. The standard modes are here, match mode (with newly added memorial match), various leagues, and cups. Some more teams now have their proper names (like &quot;Arsenal&quot; and &quot;Chelsea&quot;), and are having up to date players in the teams.

  <plot>World Super Police is a single player police pursuit game. Gameplay here is virtually identical to games like Outrun, a series of games that started life on the DOS and Amiga platforms in the mid eighties. The story behind the game is that normal police cars cannot catch criminals in really fast cars so, in order to combat increasing car crime, the World Super Police (WSP) have been formed. There are two strands to this game, one based around the Blue Wing group (WSP Japan) and the other around Red Hawks (WSP USA). In each strand there is a story but the missions are basically the same, the player&apos;s car sits firmly in the centre of the screen at the bottom and the scenery rushes by. On the left of the screen is a vertical bar which gives a &apos;radar&apos; view the road ahead The object is to keep the car on the road, travel as fast as possible avoiding other traffic, and take-out the bad guy with whatever weapons the player equipped their car(s) with. This involves racing for a minute or so until the target(s) show up on the radar at which point the felonious fiend must be stopped before they reach the border. Some missions are solo and unarmed, while in others the player is accompanied by fellow WSP in super cars and they can switch between offensive and defensive formations. The game&apos;s main menu also features a Training option which, unusually, is greyed out at the start of the game and can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions in either story. The menu also has a Royal Scramble option in which the player can replay old missions, naturally this too can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions</plot>

Each player takes timed turns bombing, shooting, causing natural and unnatural disasters, punching and blowing up the other opponent&apos;s worms. Each worm has a set amount of health and once that health is depleted or the worm drowns that worm is dead.&amp;#xA;New to the Worms series is the ability to construct buildings to aid in the fight. Build hospitals to resurrect dead worms, science labs to increase your firepower, strongholds to base your operations in and protect your worms, towers, keeps, castles and citadels to deploy weapons from there tops and weapon factories to produce multiple weapons around it at the start of each turn you take. Along with these typical building you can create Wonders in which your opponent has two turns to knock it down and if they don&apos;t succeed you win. If they in turn build there own you must destroy it to win the game.&amp;#xA;Along with the typical Worms series weapons like the mini gun, bazooka, rocket launcher, earthquake and homing pigeon (a homing missile in the form of a pigeon) you will also have weapons to destroy buildings like the trebuchet, fridge launcher, nuclear strike and the Trojan Donkey in which you get to place a Trojan Donkey where you like where it remains until it explodes, how long it takes to explode is not known. Some weapons like the Old Women and Rhino can be steered to your desired location upon which they explode on contact or exploded early by pressing a button.&amp;#xA;Throughout the game different crates will fall from the sky or teleport onto the playing field. There are four different types of crates: weapon crates (more powerful weapons), health crates (increase the health of a wounded or sick worm), utility crates (carrying instant utilities - spy (see contents of all crates on the field), double time (doubling the time for your turn) and double damage (for one turn inflict double the damage) and collectible utilities like freeze (freeze your worms or building to protect them from damage for one turn), parachute (so your worm can safely jump from heights), jet pack (to reach distant locations and heights) and repair (to fix damaged buildings)).&amp;#xA;Single play allows for a quick game, tutorial, campaign, the trials (death match against the CPU) and the viewing gallery (view movies you have unlocked in the game by winning matches, how much of the game you&apos;ve completed, check out the credits and look through the Fortapedia (a list of buildings available in the game and there descriptions)).&amp;#xA;As with the other Worms games in multiplayer you have a plethora of options to choose from to set up a match against other people including allowing the CPU to play.

  <plot>WWE All Stars can be seen as a successor to WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game. Unlike the simulation-based WWE SmackDown vs. Raw games, it offers a more arcade-oriented gameplay, featuring elements of fighting games, with over-the-top moves and unrealistic animation. Similarly to versus fighters, the wrestling in the game is predominantly combo-based. The wrestler&apos;s signature moves are exaggerated, including nearly supernatural elements such as diving high into the air or slow motion moves. The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.</plot>

  <plot>The 2008 edition in the Smackdown vs Raw series holds new features to the WWE game franchise. This is the first in the series to include the extremists of ECW, including The Sandman, Marcus Cor Von and CM Punk.&amp;#xA;The game also features a brand new struggle submission system, new weapon choices including guitars, and eight superstar fighting styles, including Showman, Powerhouse, High-Flyer and more. Each player can now choose a primary and a secondary fighting style. It continues the legend trend and brand new arenas, such as Wrestlemania 23, Unforgiven and Summerslam as well as the classic superstars like Undertaker, Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair. The roster largely depends on the platform and some versions include wrestlers not available in the other ones.&amp;#xA;The season and general manager modes of the previous games have been merged into the WWE 24/7 mode (PlayStation, Xbox 360), allowing to create a new superstar, play as an existing one or choose to manage someone. In the Wii version this is called Main Event mode and it does not contain an option to manage wrestlers.&amp;#xA;There is also a new Tournament mode with various challenges. Some of the features match types are Iron Man, Battle Royal, Hell in a Cell, Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, Hardcore, Ladder, Elimination Chamber and Royal Rumble. In the Wii version five match types are available: Single (One on One), Tag Team (Two on Two), K.O. Match, Triple Threat and Hardcore. It does not have the WWE Shop and a smaller move list, but includes Mii integration (menu screens and in-game HUD) as well as motion-sensing attacks based on the controls.&amp;#xA;The Xbox 360 versions allows players to use custom music during entrances while the PS3 version offers a first-person view during those sequences. Both are the only ones to offer online multiplayer.</plot>

  <plot>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown. One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents. The Hell in a Cell match is revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the cell door is removed. In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage. The game&apos;s new &quot;WWE Universe&quot; mode replaces the career mode from previous games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match. Road to WrestleMania mode has been modified to include new features such as backstage roaming, mini-quests, and further interaction with other Superstars. Playable storylines involve Rey Mysterio, John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. Along with that is the new storyline in which players choose Kofi Kingston, John Morrison, Dolph Ziggler, R-Truth, or a created superstar in a quest to end The Undertaker&apos;s undefeated WrestleMania streak.</plot>

  <plot>Year 20XX. Lake Turkana, Kenya. A group of scientists discover a mysterious monolith called Zohar.&amp;#xA;Year 4767 T.C. - Transcend Christ, or 7277 A.D., according to the old year-counting system. Zohar is no longer a mystery. All space ships are Zohar-powered. Humanity left the planet Earth (which is now called Lost Jerusalem) long ago, and founded a galactic empire on 30000 planets. However, a hostile alien race called &quot;Gnosis&quot; is hunting after Zohar. Giant bi-pedal robots called Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems (pronounced &quot;eggs&quot;) do not seem to be enough to stop the Gnosis. The Vector Corporation decides to develop an android called KOS-MOS to be the ultimate weapon against the Gnosis. Shion Uzuki is the 22-year-old engineer leading this project.&amp;#xA;Xenosaga is not part of the same universe as the Square game Xenogears, although it is based on the back-story of that game as written in Xenogears Perfect Works. The events of Xenosaga are roughly analogous to the very first events in the history of Xenogears, although as the series progressed events would diverge more and more from the timeline of Xenogears. &quot;Der Wille zur Macht&quot; is one of the central aspects of Friedrich Nietzsche&apos;s philosophy, meaning &quot;The will to power&quot;.&amp;#xA;The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the next few ally and enemy turns will be shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character&apos;s &quot;boost&quot; gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts. Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.</plot>

The main threat humanity has to face is the appearance of a super-powerful alien race called the Gnosis. The story picks up just after the concluding events of the first episode. Shion Uzuki, the young engineer who designed the powerful android KOS-MOS, arrives with her friends at the planet Second Miltia. They aim to learn more about the heritage of the late genius scientist Joachim Mizrahi, and to stop the schemes of the mysterious villains Albedo and Margulis. Jin Uzuki, Shion&apos;s brother, who was only mentioned in the first game, becomes an important character in the second episode. We also learn more about the origin of the boy chaos, and about the race of Realians, artificial humans created by Mizrahi.&amp;#xA;The gameplay in general and the battle system in particular are quite similar to that of the first game. All enemies are visible on screen, and field objects can be destroyed in order to attract the attention of the enemy or to create a zone that will weaken it. The turn-based combat again features triangle and square attacks, which now inflict different damage on enemies of different height. Another addition is the ability to wait two or three turns in a battle, accumulating energy for a stronger attack. The AGWS (giant robots) battles are still present, but you can&apos;t switch to AGWS at any point, like it was possible in the first game. Another game aspect removed from the first game is money, as well as shops, weapons, and armor of any kind. The only items in the game are healing items or keys that unlock the ability to learn high level skills.&amp;#xA;The second episode continues to be heavy on story development, and also has a significant amount of non-interactive cut scenes. Character graphics underwent the biggest change. The characters look now more realistic and less &quot;deformed&quot; or animé-like.</plot>

You can also unlock 2 additional characters: Jack Spicer and Chase Young.&amp;#xA;The players must defeat waves of enemy robots to collect Shen Gong Wu artifacts to increase their power and defeat series of enemies, until they are able to face Mala Mala Jong and put an end on the plans of the evil boy genius, Jack Spicer. Each Shen Gong Wu provides a new power, like locking nearby characters or punching the ground for area damage. Additional Shen Gong Wu can be bought using coins collected during the game.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is inspired by party fighting games, like Power Stone and Super Smash Bros. You can chain combos with button combinations, jump and give flying kicks.&amp;#xA;Between the game levels, there are showdowns, where the characters have to bet a Shen Gong Wu.

The player controls a futuristic aircraft and tries to reach the end of each stage, where a boss fight waits.&amp;#xA;There are several different types of attacks: a regular shot, which can be upgraded five times by power-ups dropped by enemy ships; a side attack is a risky manoeuvre that involves pushing the control stick quickly left and right to destroy enemies to the left or right of the player&apos;s ship. This will also increase the score multiplier. The ship&apos;s exhaust can also be put to use by damaging enemies that come up from behind. The final weapon is the barrier, which creates a protective ring around the player, destroying all enemies that touch it.&amp;#xA;The game also features a difficulty setting adjusted dynamically by the score - the higher the player scores, the more difficult the game gets.

You must be damn important, because everyone is trying to kill you. As you progress, you learn more about your secret agent past and your curious name, XIII.&amp;#xA;You unravel clues behind a conspiracy of epic proportions in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions such as head shots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, XIII has all the typical FPS elements: both stealth and action, more than 15 weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and a whole load of baddies in levels all over the world. During the game, you can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lockpicking and dual weapons handling.</plot>

The evil space witch Aguira is still alive after having escaped her death sentence. It&apos;s once again up to the executioner Drake to find her and bring her to justice. Aguira has used the xyanide to create a strange world that Drake has to travel through and battle countless of enemies. Xyanide Resurrection is a third person shoot &apos;em up, similar to a rail shooter. The player controls a spaceship travelling through space. Forward motion is automatic but the player can move the ship up and down and left and right to avoid the fire of the incoming enemies. The player can also rotate the view as the enemies attack from all angles. As enemies are destroyed they drop pieces of xyanide that the player can collect. Xyanide restores health but it can also be used to purchase upgrades and new weapons in the store between levels. When starting out the ship is equipped with a simple fusion gun that shoots single shots and bombs when bigger explosions are needed. Three extra weapons can be bought: shotgun, laser and rockets. It is also possible to buy a magnet to easier collect xyanide and a shield that can take some damage. The game&apos;s story mode consists of five levels that have to be completed sequentially. By playing the story mode, levels are unlocked for the quick play mode where the player can perfect his score. A digital comic and artwork can also be unlocked. There is also a score attack mode where the player has to get as many points as possible before time runs out. The multiplayer mode is for two players that compete in getting the highest score by collecting pickups. </plot>

  <plot>This 3D board game consists of a series of duels, which are played with cards. The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck.&amp;#xA;In a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.&amp;#xA;On the game board, each monster is bound by a certain movement range and attack range. They can level up, evolve, or fuse to form more powerful creatures. The goal is to become King of Capsule Monsters, the highest rank in the Coliseum. If you have cleared the four areas, the final area, King Coliseum, will appear.</plot>

  <plot>In Zombie Zone, you control Aya, a young girl who has lived with her father. An excellent swordsman, he has left his wife and the daughter Saki to live in a secluded place, teaching Aya sword techniques. His wife died, and Saki blamed the father for her death. She killed her own father, and went off to find an artifact to resurrect her mother. Now Aya must stop her own sister and avenge her father&apos;s death.&amp;#xA;The gameplay is hack-and-slash with some advanced things put in. You&apos;re fighting against zombies, so your enemies are not very smart. It&apos;s basically Aya against a very large number of slowly moving enemies, a bit like in Dynasty Warriors. There is a feature called &quot;sword fatigue&quot;: if you don&apos;t clean your sword in time, it will get stuck in an enemy, giving him an advantage over you. There are also slight RPG elements. You can upgrade your characters by collecting orbs dropped by defeated enemies. At the end of each level, you can use the orbs to make Aya more powerful. Sometimes the enemies drop red orbs; if you collect enough of them, you turn into a demon. Your attacks become more powerful, but they also take away from your health.</plot>

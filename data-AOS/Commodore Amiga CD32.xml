  <plot>Akira is a side-scrolling action game based on the anime film of the same title.&amp;#xA;In the first few levels you have to guide the main character Kaneda through an obstruction filled road on his motorcycle. Obstacles come in the form of roadblocks, holes in the road, which must be jumped with the use of a ramp, and a variety of characters on the road who throw bombs at you. The roadblocks can only be cleared by grenades which you pick up by knocking over traffic cones. You must also make it to the end of the level without running out of fuel.&amp;#xA;After the motorcycle levels there are five platform levels. The object of these levels is basically to kill everyone you come in contact with, each kill adding to a meter which you have to fill to complete the level.</plot>

  <plot>Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his bird (pardon the pun) Floella from the Meka Chickens. The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.&amp;#xA;Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</plot>

A team of marines is dispatched to investigate and destroy the unknown invaders. As their dropships enter the atmosphere and approach the base, the defence lasers, damaged in the onslaught, move into action. They launch wild bursts of laser fire at the approaching marines, who are not prepared and take heavy losses. Rookies Nash and Jordan crash-land, and must fight off the alien force.&amp;#xA;As with the previous Alien Breed, the gameplay is viewed from above. Your soldier shoots his way through the levels, collecting keys, ammunition and credits along the way. Computers can be logged into to buy new weapons. A new &apos;retreat&apos; mode allows you to fire while moving backwards.&amp;#xA;The game is largely non-linear, as most levels have multiple exits, and the game can be moved through in different ways. There is a variety of indoor and outdoor levels, although you spend most time inside some of the multi-level towers. After activating a self-destruct mechanism, you must escape the building quickly.</plot>

Gameplay is the same as its predecessor - each level is a maze to be navigated through, while fighting off hordes of aliens. The Special Edition 92 includes 12 new levels and a bunch of new features: &quot;dark missions&quot; in which only the glowing blue eyes of the aliens are visible, and the ability to jump to a level by means of a code.&amp;#xA;Quak:In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you&apos;ll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.</plot>

To keep your helpful children from losing interest, you must find Raccoon Skin Hats to give as gifts to stay in their favor. There are switches serving different functions that need to be activated. Doors will have to be entered to locate secret rooms that may contain the stars or other valuable objects. There are Rubber Leaves that may be needed to access those hard to reach areas.

The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front - strange.&amp;#xA;The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / OutRun tradition.</plot>

  <plot>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).&amp;#xA;Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can&apos;t shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</plot>

You have to reach 7,000 points to petition the Pope for the throne, and then you have to maintain those points for 4-5 game months to win the game. However, your rivals will attack you as soon as the Pope declares his support, so be sure you have a strong military before applying for the Papal backing.&amp;#xA;Castle building is more efficient and easier to deal with. You can also set up pre-made castles on file so that you can place them quickly. Battles are set in a full alternate screen with the ability to place and command each unit.</plot>

Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn&apos;t have it. It&apos;s a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.&amp;#xA;In one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons. If one player completes the level, both advance to the next one (like Lotus 2, funnily enough. I guess I ought to think of a similarity to Lotus 3, just to complete the set).

You can choose your weapons and ammunition before starting, including a wide range of guns as well as grenades and a trusty pocket-knife. You&apos;ll have to avoid land mines and destroy bridges along the way. Defeated enemies release further weapons.</plot>

  <plot>Your homeland&apos;s precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.&amp;#xA;The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship&apos;s motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.</plot>

You can choose the environmental settings of the game, in a similar way to Civilization - an icy world or a post-apocalyptic one make things much tougher.&amp;#xA;Environmental factors play the biggest part in this game, as you have to use efficient power sources if possible. You only get a certain level of power at the start of the game, and have to build enough &apos;green&apos; things to increase it further - trees are the most effective.&amp;#xA;Once you have a fully functional city capable of supporting military units of any quality, these can be directed off into battle by giving them pre-planned flight paths which can be over-ridden if need be.&amp;#xA;Two-player games can be played via null-modem cables, even across different systems.</plot>

The plan is that you will &quot;borrow&quot; aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden.

  <plot>Kid Chaos is transported from the stone age into an unknown world by evil scientists from the future. Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.&amp;#xA;Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he&apos;s running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.&amp;#xA;There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets.&amp;#xA;Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These &quot;extras&quot; probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.&amp;#xA;As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.&amp;#xA;Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there&apos;s always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he&apos;s presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers.&amp;#xA;Kid Chaos starts off easily, but the further he progresses in the game, the higher the damage factor.

In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.&amp;#xA;The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.&amp;#xA;When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.&amp;#xA;Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back.&amp;#xA;Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.</plot>

After a period of peace threatens the ratings, two alien scientists go back in time on various continents of the planet and start to deploy modern weaponry on them.

The player controls a character pertinent to the time period (an American Indian from 1400 A.D. - America, a knight from medieval England, a Chinese warrior from Imperial China, an Egyptian acolyte from ancient Egypt, and Billy in the alien spaceship).&amp;#xA;These characters collect objects and coins to buy items, weapons to fight the enemies and hearts to increase the health bar (located on the top-left of the screen).

Little did they know that the club was entering an unprecedented run of success that has continued well into the 2000s.&amp;#xA;The basic control system will be familiar to anyone who&apos;s played a Kick Off game, as it involves holding fire to trap the ball under your player&apos;s foot, and releasing fire to pass, although the ball will be kicked onwards if it is moving fast when it comes to you. Other gameplay features include diving headers, variable pitch conditions, penalty shoot-outs and accurate deflections. 2500 players featured in the game all had a range of varied ability statistics, as well as different skin tones.&amp;#xA;As well as individual matches and custom-created tournaments (which have much the same range of features as Sensible Soccer, plus full calculation of injury and suspension severities, including disciplinary points and differing injury lengths), you can play out a full season of matches for any club in England&apos;s top 5 divisions - all domestic league and cup matches are included, with promotions and relegations taking place after each season.

  <plot>Six film reels have been stolen from your film studios by a rival company. In this platform game, your mission is to rescue from within the sets and backstage rooms they have been hidden in. Backstage sections are entered through doors, and weapons can often be collected in these.&amp;#xA;The sets are themed around six different genres of film, and the backdrops, weapons and enemies fit these sections. There is a slapstick comedy played out in black and white (complete with greyscale background) a cartoon with lots of Road Runnering and goofy facial expressions, a Wild West romp, Sci-Fi complete with aliens, and so on. After each platform level you will have to pass through a film scene - piloting a runaway mine-cart, navigating a scrolling shoot &apos;em up level, or similar.</plot>

There are two gameplay modes, Arcade and Normal - in Arcade mode you have to finish in the top 3 each time, whereas in Normal mode you accumulate the appropriate points, irrespective of one or two bad results. There are 3 difficulty levels, and the number of laps is variable. The field includes 22 cars (you can choose between a Ferrari, Williams, McLaren and Benetton), and contact with these (or with the kerbing or roadside barriers) inflicts damage on your car. This may get bad enough that you have to pit for repairs (if you don&apos;t make it to the pits and have more contact, you may get forced out altogether). Avoiding the slower cars you come up to lap can be crucial.</plot>

When on the field, the player has various icons available which are used to display or hide information, e.g. about the current hole and wind. The game offers two different control methods for the shot: two-click (choosing the loft from a menu and then clicking twice with the correct timing to select the power and drift) and the stroke method (after selecting the power, a miniature ball appears and the player has to click on it. The position of the click sets where the club hits the ball and therefore the drift). The latter is also available in a variant in which the ball randomly moves to make it harder.The tournament itself is a match between a European and US team with twelve athletes each. There is also the possibility to train the single holes instead of participating in the tournament.</plot>

  <plot>Most of the fundamentals of this game work in a similar way to Desert Strike. You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase.&amp;#xA;Before each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle&apos;s weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don&apos;t give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples)&amp;#xA;Missions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield.&amp;#xA;Unusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement. When you rotate the direction the ground moves underneath you, ensuring a more realistic effect and smartly mimicking motion effects.</plot>

You start off managing Folkford United, the worst team in the country, with players including Brian Evans, Nicky Moody and Bruce Roberts, and rival teams include Oldcastle, Marwick and Stoke Berry.&amp;#xA;The second difference is the lack of statistics for player details. Instead, sentences such as &apos;best in defence, can also play in midfield. Has been playing reasonably well. Signed for £100,000 from Oldcastle 2 years ago. Current value around £150,000&apos; are used, and its through playing matches and noting player ratings that you interpret how good a defender he is.&amp;#xA;Another break with convention is an attempt at a human side, with players and fans communicating with you, offering advice, praise or semi-literate criticism.&amp;#xA;The training feature is more complex than usual, requiring you to select 3 activities (from a selection such as passing, gym work and lap running) for each player each week - players will complain if they feel your selections are boring or unhelpful.&amp;#xA;If you own either Emlyn Hughes&apos; International Soccer (for the standard versions) or Wembley International Soccer (for the Amiga 1200 version) you can play around 1 match in 6, and watch all the others - otherwise you simply see a progressive score update, and can intervene with substitutions or tactical changes.</plot>

  <plot>This platform game bares a similarity to Bubble Bobble in many ways. There are 100 single screen levels, featuring variously shaped ledges, for the two characters to face before escaping from the Tower of Time.&amp;#xA;These levels are laden with nasty bugs, but you have a methane gun to shoot at them. This absorbs them, and allows them to be fired out against a wall; if they don&apos;t reach the wall, they live to fight another day.

  <plot>Putty is a platform game where the lead character is... a blob of putty. He has been expelled from Putty Moon by Dazzledaze the wizard and his assistant Dweezil the Cat. Your job is to lead the character round the platform levels making use of his special abilities to rescue and destroy.&amp;#xA;When moving, Putty has a natural bounce, and his eyes are loosely attached, moving after his body after falls (as a visual effect). He has many moves available - he can stretch himself to traverse larger gaps between (or move up/down) platforms, unleash a long-range punch, explode (which works like a smart bomb, clearing the screen of enemies) or flatten himself into a puddle on the floor (to absorb anything that walks over him).</plot>

You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering.&amp;#xA;24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you&apos;re much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there&apos;s no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.&amp;#xA;The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.</plot>

Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success.

Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.&amp;#xA;Humans 2 Available in both stand-alone and add-on forms, The Jurassic Levels is presumably named to cash in on the then-current Jurassic Park hype.

Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword.

You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.&amp;#xA;Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap.&amp;#xA;Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.</plot>

  <plot>UFO Enemy Unknown is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can&apos;t afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished, and so on.</plot>

  <plot>This is the updated version of Super Skidmarks: A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga. A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering. 24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you&apos;re much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there&apos;s no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.</plot>

  <plot>Vital Light is one of those innovative games which only appear once a while. In this particular one, you have to control a small paint gun that contains five different colored paints, and destroy blocks that are falling toward you by making them all the same color. Your paint gun is on a roller at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal strips of colored blocks fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds. Holding down the fire button and pushing left or right changes the currently selected color, and sometimes you only just have enough time to get the right color before the blocks smash into you. As the blocks fall at varying speeds, there are times when an avalanche is set off by a slow block being hit by a fast moving block above it. This is a game that gets very, very frantic.</plot>

Gameplay emphasizes one-touch passing, with a picture-in-picture window displayed when you prepare to play a long pass, which increases you chances of finding the target player. The AGA version was the first floppy-based game to supports a CD32 controller, making it easier to execute moves. 64 international teams are included, with the chance to play a full league competition or a World Cup. Full control over formation and tactics is offered before the match.</plot>

The game consists of horizontally scrolling levels and levels where the player controls the ship from behind in a pseudo-3D perspective.

  <plot>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren&apos;t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you&apos;d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy -this reduces the significance of the points system.</plot>

In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single &apos;Unfriendly&apos; matches.&amp;#xA;Unlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a &apos;Penalty Shoot Out&apos;, which involves going round shooting the opposition;- the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.</plot>

  <plot>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.&amp;#xA;Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.&amp;#xA;There&apos;s a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.&amp;#xA;There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</plot>

New to the sequel is Zool&apos;s ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks.&amp;#xA;On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool&apos;s pet 2-headed dog.</plot>

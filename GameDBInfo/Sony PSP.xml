    <story>Skies of Deception is the second game in the action flight series to appear on the PSP. The player commands the Gryphus Squadron, one of the last to remain for Aurelia with its single airbase, a nation on the southern edge of the Osean Continent. In 2020, Aurelia is attacked by the neighboring country of Leasath, lead by Diego Gaspar Navarro. They invaded because Aurelia was supposedly involved with aiding their enemies in the civil war. There&apos;s a variety of crafts with different paint schemes to choose from and many battle missions to attend. In the campaign mode (as usual with different paths to complete it), players can unlock parts to tune their planes. Money is earned by destroying enemies and completing objectives. There are 17 missions in total, but the quickest route in the campaign mode can be done in 10. There is a new multiplayer mode: now up to 4 players can take up one mission in a cooperative (2 players against 2 AI-controlled fighters) or the versus mode with different game types such as Dogfight-Survival, Dog Fight-Shoot Out, Base Attack, Air Superiority, Beacon Battle and Escort Mission.</story>

    <story>The PSP version of Activision Anthology is a compilation of 44 classic Atari 2600 titles. On top of that, it includes an eighties soundtrack with 10 licensed songs to pull you back into that era.

Games can be played in the original aspect ratios (windowed in the middle of the screen), or stretched for a full-screen view.

High scores are recorded and you can unlock achievements such as original gamer patches and vintage TV commercials. The following games are included: 1. Atlantis 2. Barnstorming 3. Beamrider 4. Boxing 5. Bridge 6. Checkers 7. Chopper Command 8. Cosmic Commuter 9. Crackpots 10. Decathlon (The Activision Decathlon) 11. Demon Attack 12. Dolphin 13. Dragster 14. Enduro 15. Fishing Derby 16.

    <story>Aedis Complex: Generation of Chaos is the fifth in the series of Generation of Chaos series and a follow up to the first release on the PSP. The game is a mix of RPG and real-time strategy with three different worlds to play in, each with their own main characters and storyline. The main story takes place on the Island of Aedis, where a bloody war broke loose and became so prevalent that a magical entiny was born from the conflict. The Mugen had become sick of the constant fighting a cast a terrible spell on the land, splitting the world, where the survivors took refuge and tried to live in peace. There are three worlds, Divine, Surface and Lower. In the Divine World, the races of Hellions and Angels have lived in peace for years, but the Prince of Hell Atrapollus, is pressured into a war by his advisors when the King of Hell was murdered on a Divine Celebration, claiming that the Angels were responsible. The Queen of Heaven, Rose, and her brother gather together an army of angels to help them fight back the Hellions. In the Surface World, the Kingdom of Laurid was allied with the King of Zemora for many years, but one day, Laurid was the victim of a surprise attack and was conquered by the King&apos;s forces. In this there are three friends that are caught up in the battle, a young warrior named Steiner, his sister Fiona and her fiance Raphelos, afterwards Raphelos disappears. Ten years later, a mysterious warrior by the name of Herault arrives and has a confrontation with Steiner, who is now the Prince of Zemora. Herault and two other companions must now try and free Laurid and learn of the devastating secret that led to the invasion. In the Lower World, an industrial world that has mech-style weapons called Cyber Suits. Here a young military student by the name of Quinn is witness to an invasion that sees a mysterious army show up with advanced Cyber Suits and threatens to destroy is city. Along with his friends Gon and Keri, they must learn of the invaders plans and discover their weaknesses to save their city. The gameplay is broken down into three areas, there is a Field Map that is a top-down view of a map, where players can move their units into strategic positions in a series of grids in a turn-based fashion, where players can also come across elemental grids that can slow down their units as well as construct buildings and rework the land to their liking. There are also events that happen after a turn that can either help the players units or demoralize them and battles are conducted when one enemy unit encounters another. The World Map, where the players views the outline of the lands and which territories are controlled as well as equip units, using experience points to make them stronger and give army captains duties and jobs. The Battle Screen is a real-time event, where the armies can be controlled and manipulated into various battle formations that can devastate enemy lines and also can be equipped with special weapons and use special magical attacks that can decimate enemy groups. The battle is over when either captain is killed, with over 100 different units to control and 150 different weapons and armor that can be used.</story>

    <story>After Burner: Black Falcon is the fourth game in the After Burner series, released almost fifteen years after the previous game. Just like the earlier ones it is an action based flying game, shown from a third-person perspective. Familiar characteristics are the fast pace, taking on many enemies at once with a combination of hit-scan and lock-on weapons, and evasive manoeuvres through rolls. The game consists of 24 levels. Players choose from three pilots (Billy Blaze, Harrison Duke and Tomiko Rossellini) to go after the terrorist cell Black Falcon that has stolen thirteen prototype planes. Each pilot brings along different plot twists and there are nineteen different planes to fly (mostly jets). They can be equipped with weapons and items, or be given a paint job. The game takes place on locations all over the world and while flying there are often short sequences by the pilots. There are also many objects in the scenery that need to be avoided or destroyed. Missions have main objectives and side missions that brings along more money for upgrades. As usual, there are large bosses that wield weapons such as EMP. Multiplayer is supported for eight players, in competitive modes and a two-player cooperative mode.</story>

    <story>Air Conflicts: Aces of World War II is the Sony PSP port of the Windows game Air Conflicts: Air Battles of World War II, which is an arcade flight simulator set in World War II. The game features over 200 seemingly historically accurate missions in 13 campaigns. The player can choose between the US Army Air Force, the Royal Air Force, the Luftwaffe or the Red Army Air Force. There are 17 WWII-era planes to fly with in the game. The missions consist of patrols, manoeuvres, strategic bombing, air support, air superiority, interdiction, paratroops and supply deployment and prevent bombing missions. Each mission lasts about 5-10 minutes so the game is pretty easy to play while commuting, for example. Most of the missions are either dogfight missions, bombing missions, or combinations thereof. If a mission is failed the campaign continues emphasizing the fact that the war goes on regardless of the outcome of a single mission. In addition to the single player campaigns the game features a 8 player multiplayer deathmatch mode in an ad-hoc WLAN network. There&apos;s also a game sharing feature for giving a single mission from the game to a friend or playing a multiplayer match without needing the other players to own the game. The game includes all other features from the original PC version except that there is no team deathmatch mode, only normal deathmatch. The USAAF campaign is a new feature in the PSP version and does not exist in the original PC version.</story>

    <story>Alien Syndrome is a top down shooter inspired by Sega&apos;s original Alien Syndrome action game. The games story takes place thousands of years in the future; by this point in time mankind has explored many parts of the galaxy and established numerous colonies. One such colony, Seti-Alpha 5 (SAT5), has ceased communications for some reason and it is your job to head to SAT5 and investigate what went wrong. Upon arrival, you encounter the alien syndrome, a force which can mutate man and machine into deadly aliens. These events take place roughly 100 years after those in the original Alien Syndrome game. When you begin the game you can select one of several characters as well as choose a character specialty (such as demolitions expert, firebug, seal, tank, and sharpshooter). The specialty you select will determine your initial character stats; as you play through the game you earn levels which provide you points to allocate towards improving your stats. The character stats help determine your characters accuracy in ranged or close attacks, speed, healing power, resistance to fire/radiation, armor strength, and so on. Similar to the original game, the action is viewed top down. You&apos;ll need to explore the numerous corridors and rooms found on SAT5 and eliminate the numerous alien invaders found there. Mission objectives are often provided to you which need to be completed. Additional weapons, ammo, and other useful items can be found throughout the levels. Your character has a limited amount of energy, and if all energy is lost then you will need to begin again at the last checkpoint crossed.</story>

    <story>Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem is based on the movie of the same name and continues the mix of the Aliens and Predator franchises. The basic premise of the movie is followed. Picking up where the original film left off, a group of predators travels back to the homeworld with a predalien, a survivor impregnated with an alien embryo. In a struggle to kill the creature that possesses the strengths and weaknesses of both species, the ship crashes on earth. A father and a son who investigate the vessel are impregnated by facehuggers allowing the aliens to continue their colonization of the planet. When a lone predator scout discovers the ship has crashed, he travels to earth to rid it of the intruders. Players take control of the predator from a third-person perspective. While the humans and aliens are fighting, his main task is to dissolve and disintegrate all evidence of extraterrestrial life. During the course of the game, the aliens are the main enemies, but humans will also engage the predator when he is sighted. The predator can activate a cloak, but this drains energy so it needs to be recharged every now and then by returning to the normal mode. The cloak automatically disappears when in contact with water. He also has three vision modes (tech, thermal and alien) to get a better look of the environment. Enemies can be locked to make it easier to track them while they are moving. The shoulder buttons control the camera while the analogue stick is used to run around. Next to basic wrist attacks he also has additional weapons such as a shoulder cannon, hand cannon and a disc that can be thrown. The available weapons can be selected before starting a mission. These can be upgraded after completing missions. He can also zoom in (switching to a first-person mode) and tag aliens to earn honour points. These can be used to upgrade weapons and are also awarded when no humans are killed. Basic movement includes jumping, breaking through walls, climbing and shaking off aliens when pinned down as well. To progress, a certain amount of evidence usually needs to be removed first. The game offers branched missions paths with entirely different settings. While playing, a map can be activated to shown the environment, enemies and objectives. Next to the main storyline, there are skirmish matches that can be played with two players cooperatively as well.</story>

While a key feature of the original game was innovative use of the dual Analog Sticks, the PSP has no such luxury. As a result, controls have been re-mapped to the face buttons. Jumping is performed by pressing X, while the other three buttons can be used to control the selected gadget, usually by holding or rapidly pressing the assigned button (depending on the gadget). The game also features a variety of mini-games that can be played either solo, or via wireless multiplayer. These mini-games can be unlocked by collecting hidden Specter Coins which are scattered throughout the various levels. While two of the games, Snow Kidz Racing and Specter Boxing, are from the original game, there are two new games to unlock - Ape Ping Pong and Jake Attacks.</story>

    <story>Specter&apos;s fed up with losing time and again in his attempts to take over the world. So he&apos;s decided to train his army of monkeys! With the finest tutors at Ape Academy, and himself as headmaster, he&apos;s sure to whip his students into shape! Ape Escape Academy sees you taking on the role of one of the cheeky monkeys from the Ape Escape series. Choose your chimp, then prepare to tackle various classes in Academy Mode. Each &apos;class&apos; is actually a mini-game. Your goal is to complete as many mini-games as possible from the 9x9 grid, and score as many lines as you can (sort of like Noughts and Crosses). Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just plain silly, like protecting a roast banana from oncoming apes, or flying through the sky delivering parachutes to plummeting primates. As you unlock games in Academy Mode, you can begin to play them in the Mini-game Collection. Here, you can choose from available mini-games, and play them as you wish to become better at them. Some mini-games also have hidden statues in them - grab these to unlock more monkey profiles in your Showcase. Finally, you can also choose to play Ape Escape Academy against up to three friends as you fight to find out who&apos;s the best.</story>

    <story>In Archer Maclean&apos;s Mercury, your job is to guide a blob of mercury, or several blobs, along various mazes, by tilting the game world. En route, you are required to run over color markers, which will change the color of your blob to the color required to win the level. Some areas of the game will require you to split your mercury into two, roll each blob over two different colored switches, and then combine the two blobs to form a third, different color. Each level has different elements to it, some of which will help you and some of which will hinder you. There are conveyor belts, moving platforms, launch pads, and jagged corners that when hit, will cause your blob to split into two, even three. There are 83 different mazes, each one progressively harder than the last.</story>

    <story>Arthur and the Invisibles: The Game is an action-adventure based on the mostly animated film from director Luc Besson who also wrote the children&apos;s books it originated from. It follows the film&apos;s storyline after the live-action part where a boy must save his grandmother&apos;s house from a greedy developer by finding a treasure that his grandfather went missing in searching for it in the magical land of the tiny Minimoy. When the boy Arthur enters a portal to their land, he shrinks in size and changes his appearance so he becomes like a Minimoy also. Arthur and his two friends, princess Selenia and her brother Bétamèche, try to save the Minimoys from certain destruction. There is a tutorial which teaches you movement and combat plus how to move objects and flip switches. The action begins when a Minimoy ceremony is interrupted by enemy mosquitoes. You have to alternately play as all the three characters and use the special abilities of each to fight, solve puzzles, fly and drive. Arthur can smash spiderwebs and climb, while Selenia can cut through foliage, and Betameche can crawl through small spaces and packs an upgradable projectile-based weapon. Defeating enemies that have special keys is necessary in order to open gates to progress in the game. In one scene, they ride a mosquito through a cavern while shooting other mosquitoes from the air. There are also racing sections. Scenes from the film move the story along from one set piece to another.</story>

    <story>The sequel to Asphalt: Urban GT continues the fast-paced racing of the original game with various additions. Races take place on eight locations all over the world. While racing, smashing other cars, or avoiding the police, there is cash to collect. Money becomes available by risky driving, wiping out opponents or cops, or by picking up items. When a certain cash level is reached, new elements are opened up, such as parts to tune the car (for free), new tracks, new vehicles, or a new game mode. For the first time in the series, bikes are also available. While racing, a boost meter can be built up by picking up specific items or taking out other cars. A double boost can be applied for high speeds, while a double tap to the right or the left makes the car drift. By ignoring all driving regulations, a wanted meter slowly builds up. The cops will chase with regular patrol cars, helicopters, or they will set up a road block. The game offers 4 modes: 1. Evolution: race for the first place. 2. Duel: race against a single opponent, with a bet. The higher the prize, the tougher the cops are. 3. Beat &apos;Em All: win the race by wiping out all opponents before the finish line is reached. 4. Cop Chase: play as patrol car and wipe out all illegal racers. The game&apos;s theme song is a digitized version of Moby&apos;s Lift Me Up (which is also the intro music for UK TV&apos;s Formula One racing coverage) and the girls of the pop group The Pussycat Dolls make an appearance before and after each race.</story>

    <story>Assassin&apos;s Creed: Bloodlines is a PSP-exclusive game that continues the story of the first Assassin&apos;s Creed game and also builds up to its sequel Assassin&apos;s Creed II. Unlike the Assassin&apos;s Creed: Altaïr&apos;s Chronicles spin-off for mobile and portable devices, it offers the open world and nonlinear gameplay of the original game. The game is set one month after the events of the first game and takes place in the two cities Limassol and Kyrenia on the island of Cyprus. The Templars have moved there and Altaïr has followed them to find out what their plans are and to take all of them out if there is an opportunity. The main villain is Armand Bouchart, grand master of the Templars, who is hunting the apple of Eden, which will allow him to control the minds of anyone he chooses. Gameplay runs on similar vein to the original Assasin&apos;s Creed. Altaïr has the ability move freely through each of the cities in the familiar parkour style based on stealth and sneaking up on targets. Players can also opt to have Altaïr simply fight his way in at street level and go in through the front door. Altaïr&apos;s arsenal consists of his fists for melee (usually non-lethal) combat, his signature sleeve sword and a longsword. Bloodlines also features PS3 connectivity via USB, which allows you to unlock six new weapons in Assasin&apos;s Creed II when your PSP is hooked up to your PS3. These can also be used in the PSP version. In addition to this, any Templar coins you find in Bloodlines are carried over to Assassin&apos;s Creed II, and codex pages will give you a health boost.</story>

    <story>You play as the characters Aang, Katara, Haru, and Sokka (all characters from the Nickelodeon cartoon of the same name) in this action adventure title. The game follows the context of the cartoon, in which the world is split up into four nations each dedicated to an element; earth, air, water and fire. Your primary character, Aang, is the newest incarnation of the Avatar, capable of mastering all four elements. The adventure of this game takes place between the first and second seasons on the cartoon, and is a completely separate side-story. As with most games of the action adventure genre, you view the game from a top-down viewpoint and travel around areas fighting monsters and looking for specific items required for quests to progress further through the game. The game unfolds over several chapters, and once you move on from one chapter you cannot backtrack to previous areas. As your characters levels increase with experience, they will gain new bending powers. Also as you progress through the game you will find new armor and equipment for the playable characters to use.</story>

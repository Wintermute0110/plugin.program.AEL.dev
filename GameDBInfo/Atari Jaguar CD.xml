    <story>The premise of Baldies is similar to many real-time strategy games. You start with a limited number of Baldies with which you construct buildings, increase your population, and create the necessary instruments of war. There are four classes of Baldies--builders, scientists, soldiers, and workers/breeders. Structures include small, medium, large, and huge houses as well as science labs and barracks. Each building has specific properties that assist in your destruction of the enemy.</story>

    <story>Battlemorph is the Jaguar CD sequel to the first Jaguar cartridge, Cybermorph. This game takes place 30 years after the original. The Pernitian empire, long thought to be extinct, is back with a vengeance. Your new War Griffon craft must travel to 8 different star clusters so that your star ship can find the plasma it needs to make it&apos;s way to the Pernish cluster. Once you take out the Pernish home world, the galaxy may be safe from the Pernitians once and for all. Battlemorph plays similarly to Cybermorph, except with some new gameplay features. Now, some missions require you to travel underground into caves and tunnels. It is also possible to dive under the oceans on the planet&apos;s surface. There are also many new objects, weapons, and enemies to interact with.</story>

    <story>Iron Soldier 2 puts you back in the pilot&apos;s seat of a 42 foot tall humanoid war machine. The old Iron Fist corporation is gone, and a new democratic republic has been set up. The peace is short lived, though. Iron Fist&apos;s rival, PENTA corporation, is now threatening the United Republic&apos;s stability. You are a pilot for the United Republic, and must stop PENTA&apos;s advances. Iron Soldier 2 plays similarly to the first game. You have new weapons, new enemies, and 20 super-challenging missions to contend with. Originally released on CD, Telegames later released a cartridge version, featuring the same gameplay as the CD version, but lacking music as well as having had the FMV sequences replaced with still images due to space constraints.</story>

    <story>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it&apos;s just a book, isn&apos;t it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you&apos;re here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore. Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books. The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support. The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</story>

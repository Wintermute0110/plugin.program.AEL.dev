    <story>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time. The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</story>

What&apos;s worse, there&apos;s only one escape pod. You control one of the 8 survivors, and have to finish off all the others to escape with your life. The gameplay in Cosmic carnage is similar to Street Fighter 2, but with a much slower pace.

It is one of the few 32X games to used texture-mapped polygons. Players control a lone starship rushing to destroy oncoming asteroids and alien vessels before they annihilate defenseless human miners and colonies. Asteroids break apart into smaller rocks, which much also be hunted down and destroyed. Aliens likewise arrive in larger, more dangerous vessels. Asteroids broken down to their smallest size and then vaporized will sometimes drop shield or energy recharges, to repair damage caused by laser blasts or collisions. New weapons can also be found. Players have a time limit to meet all objectives in a stage before they are forced to land and try again. The right side of the HUD shows asteroids remaining (and their approximate size), while the left shows the player&apos;s distance to their base (and so, time remaining in the stage).</story>

    <story>The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars&apos; moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons. id Software&apos;s follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine&apos;s perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level. The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass. DOOM&apos;s engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein&apos;s, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein&apos;s orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels. Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned. DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important. DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein&apos;s arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups. The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures. DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect &apos;frag&apos; points for a kill and re-spawn in a random </story>

    <story>Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept. There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game&apos;s commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases. The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it&apos;s possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you&apos;re not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</story>

This contraption only allows Knuckles to free one of his friends at a time be attaching a tether between himself and them. Therefore, when you play the game you are always attached to another character. Although the basic gameplay of Knuckles Chaotix is similar to the Sonic games, the bungee cord between the two characters creates new challenges. The new characters that appear are Vector the Crocodile, Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee. There also two characters whose sole purpose is to slow you down, Heavy the Robot, and Bomb. Chaotix adds several new power-ups and 3D bonus levels as well.</story>

    <story>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers. Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate. The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu: 1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them. Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground. &amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x. &amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</story>

    <story>WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the popular WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret Hit Man Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger. Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</story>

    <story>This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter has gameplay is somewhat like Sega arcade classic Zaxxon. The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment. The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons. Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element. Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit. To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups. In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems. This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.</story>

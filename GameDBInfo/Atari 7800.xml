    <story>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship&apos;s photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen. The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process. Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level. Game Difficulty and Variations There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. The game also offers three different game variations: 1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player&apos;s ship is destroyed. 2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player&apos;s spaceship will destroy the other player&apos;s spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves. 3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player&apos;s spaceship will not destroy the other player&apos;s spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined. Scoring The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points. 1. Small saucer - 1,000 points 2. Other player&apos;s ship - 500 points 3. Large saucer - 200 points 4. Small asteroid - 100 points 5. Medium asteroid - 50 points 6. Large asteroid - 20 points</story>

For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth&apos;s honor and the title Masterblazer! Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent&apos;s goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent. The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game. Scoring Close-in goals - 1 point Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points OTH shots - 3 points Players may steal points from each other by making goals. The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points. A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically </story>

There are six characters to choose from (ten in Atari Lynx version); each with their own health, speed, and power attributes. Each player without the ball can jump to block a shot or punch there opponent to get the ball. There&apos;s also an option to perform a power throw on an opposing player. Players with the ball can shoot or pass. Power ups appear on the court at random instances. These power up one attribute for the player.

    <story>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest&apos;s insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. Insect Opponents and Mushrooms All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following: 1. The Centipede The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments. Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again. The Spider The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances. The Flea The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster. The Scorpion The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches. Mushrooms Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom. Game Difficulty and Variations The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following: 1. One Player Two Player Alternating Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten. Dual Player Competition Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player. Team Play Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player. Scoring The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following: Centipede Head - 100 points Centipede Body Segment - 10 points Spider at close range - 900 points Spider at medium range - 600 points Flea - 200 points Scorpion - 1,000 points Flea - 200 points Restored mushroom - 5 points Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</story>

    <story>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo&apos;s first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally Jumpman) and Donkey Kong. Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty. Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, living fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline&apos;s hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points. Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980&apos;s consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.</story>

    <story>Mario has kidnapped Junior&apos;s Papa! Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario&apos;s Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey&apos;s Father. Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored. Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior. In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty. Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980&apos;s console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</story>

Certain aliens have tractor beams they can use to capture one of your ships. If that wasn&apos;t your last life, you can try to shoot that alien down and recapture your ship, giving you two ships at once and doubling your firepower. A summary screen appears when the game is over, giving you both your final score and you final hit ratio--the number of missiles fired, enemies destroyed, and the percentage of targets hit.</story>

Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded unbeatable(?) pterodactyl.

    <story>Pebbele Beach and St. Andrews are two of the courses on offer in this golf simulation, released in the early years of 16-bit technology. The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade. Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn&apos;t choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren&apos;t a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Begginer/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring. A uniquie feature for the day was the course designer, which was quite versatile with practice.</story>

Inside the reactor are numerous (and dangerous) particles which will damage the control rods if they collide. Using the light gun, you need to shoot and destroy the various particles before the control rods are destroyed. As the control rods take damage, the walls of the reactor will slowly cave inward, decreasing the amount of space available. From time to time power crystals may appear; if shot, these will provide bonuses such as extra points, control rod repair, temporarily freeze the particles, more powerful shots, and more. The game ends when the control rods have been completely destroyed causing the reactor to meltdown.</story>

On each of the holes, you alternate between the golf and action parts. First you hit the ball by selecting the direction and distance from the overhead view on the bottom of the screen; next you will need to run to the location your ball was hit while defending yourself from the many enemies. Depending on the terrain you need to cross, various enemy ninjas, giant frogs, killer sharks, snakes, and other enemies will all get in your way. To eliminate the enemies, you can kick, punch, or use a throwing star. Several bonuses may be found from time to time; temporary invincibility, an extra life, health restoration, or a magic transport to the green may all appear on the screen. Once you have reached the green, you will need to defeat a fire breathing dragon which guards the hole. The nine hole course progressively increases in difficulty and features par 3, par 4, and par 5 holes.</story>

    <story>This is a port of the arcade game of the same name. You are a mutant human, who by some freak of nature has the ability to shoot energy pulses from his body in eight different directions! Your job is simple: save humanity from their own creation -- the ROBOTRONS! The gameplay is pretty unique for the time. You can move and fire in any of eight directions. You get thrown in a room with various evil baddies strewn about, you&apos;ve got to kill all the robots while at the same time finding some way to grab humans and avoid death.</story>

    <story>Sentinel is a side scrolling action game. Several worlds have fallen victim of an alien attack, and you need to free them. To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don&apos;t destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear. Three levels of difficulty are available.</story>

Each wrestler can kick, punch, and perform several moves such as the airplane spin, body slam, power lift, and more. Using the available moves you need to deplete your opponents energy and pin him for three counts (though be careful, as some of the more powerful moves also use up a bit of your own energy). If your opponents energy is low enough and you successfully pin him that will count as a fall, and the best out of three falls will win the match!</story>

    <story>To be born with wings... Become a F-14 Naval Aviator undergoing seek and destroy missions while dodging and gunning enemy bogeys in deadly dogfights with your 20mm cannon and air-to-air missiles. You cockpit comes with state of the art technology, courtesy of the U.S. Air Force: Display and main computer, Bogey Alert Indicator, G-Force Indicator, Electronic Counter Measures, and a Cannon Overheat Indicator (yes, it can overheat!)...and if your feeling up to it, give the ol&apos;bird a boost to Mach 1.0! The gameplay like other simulation games consists of taking off, flying, combat and landing. Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision. Taking off and landing however, also required additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he&apos;s the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try no to run over him...yet). Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that&apos;s a lot of missiles!). After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</story>

    <story>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect. Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-&apos;em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</story>

A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos. A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs. Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987. Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</story>

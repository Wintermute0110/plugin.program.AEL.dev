These robots are used for entertainment and fight in arena fights against one-another for the title Master of Masters. You play a duo of characters that participates in these gladiator battles. You can control both characters and have to explore and perform quests to earn money and items to upgrade your Unitron robot with. You can talk to inhabitants of the city and buy new items at stores. The Unitron changes visibly when you apply upgrades and a great deal of upgrades are at hand. Over two hundred different weapon configurations are possible. Each weapon and part has a certain material and element. Fire weapons will work better against wooden robots than water-based robots. Beneath the city there are large dungeons where most quests will have to be solved and most items will be found. The battles are like in Pokémon, completely menu based. You pick whatever powers you want to use from a drop-down list.</story>

    <story>Crush Roller is a game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color based on the 1981 arcade game Make Trax, which was released as Crush Roller in Europe and Asia. The object of the game is to color the entire maze-like playing field with a paint brush. While you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life. A level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth more points. Every once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks have to be repainted. When the entire maze is painted you win the level. Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo Pocket Color version has multiple levels.</story>

The two games are rather like joint Pokemon releases (Red/Blue, etc) wherein they are overall the same game with a variety of smaller differences. The player takes control of a character named Becky. The game takes place in the future and the world is primarily surrounded by water. The only land is a small patch called Terra. The player must prove their worth to be accepted on to Terra by proving their skill as a submarine commander and destroying enemy vessels. Becky&apos;s version features different characters, items and boats from Matt&apos;s Version. These are logged in a device similar to a Pokédex (from Pokemon). Battles take place against enemy ships and a radar view is used to help the player guide torpedoes towards the enemy vessels. Much of the game is text-based with animated cutscenes. The game features the ability for two players to link up Neo Geo Pocket Color units to exchanges ships and data, and to battle one on one. The game also features battery back-up and a training mode.</story>

    <story>A portable version of Evolution: The World of Sacred Device. Eternal Dungeon tells the story of the young explorer Mag Launcher and his quest for the fabled Evolutia, an item of immense power. The basic premise of the game is to take quests in the town and then assemble your party and attempt to clear out the many dungeons in the game, grinding your characters and getting the loot and experience needed to advance the plot and buy items, equipment, and upgrades for your Cy-frame, a robotic attachment that enables Mag to enhance his combat abilities. As expected for a portable version, the gameplay has been significantly downgraded from its original Dreamcast version. Town navigation is menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed instead of randomly generated. Combat is turn-based using a menu system from which you select your actions for each party member (up to 3) and execute them, but otherwise remains unchanged.</story>

Heavily story driven, this strategy RPG takes place in a time when mechs known as TS are the weapon of choice for combat. Gameplay revolves around the battles and customising your TS between those battles. Battles are part turn based and part realtime. The player inputs their actions at the beginning of the turn. The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in realtime for the duration of the turn. This makes thinking about what your opponents and allies will do in advance essential before taking your turn.</story>

    <story>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980&apos;s, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board. Pac-Man&apos;s goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man. Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</story>

    <story>The game has 220 total puzzles, 200 are initially unlockable, additional puzzles are unlocked once you complete the originals. At first you start off on a 10x10 grid but eventually you will work your way up to a 20x 20 grid. Obviously, the larger the grid becomes the more detailed and complex the puzzle. The game is played sort of like a cross words number puzzle... you are given hints and asked to fill in boxes in either a line or a column. For example on the 10x 10 grid you might see a line that says 10 next to it. This means all 10 boxes in the line are filled in. Also you might see a 5, 4 - this means fill 5 boxes, leave one, and fill the last 4. It gets trickier when the clue does not total 10. Then the only way to solve is by using logic and cross-referencing with nearby columns and lines to find a solution. There are several ways to make the process easier. For example, looking for symmetric clues can some times help you solve the puzzle from the middle out. Also locking down and edge gives you a sort of &apos;&apos;anchor&apos;&apos; from which to build. It’s definitely a battle of wits. When the puzzle is completed, it should look like some kind of picture. The game rewards you after each completion by coloring the puzzle and telling you what it is.</story>

    <story>Puzzle Bobble is a real-time puzzle game in which the player controls a device called pointer at the bottom of the screen, aiming and releasing randomly colored bubbles upwards. Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.If the ceiling of the area is covered by too many bubbles, it will gradually descend; the game is over when it nearly reaches the player-controlled pointer. Should the player fail to release the bubbles within a specific time limit, they will be released automatically, unaffected by the pointer&apos;s aiming.</story>

    <story>Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve. There are three different modes: In Normal you have to link two special blocks that appear after some time. If you manage to finish the level within the time limit you will unlock one of 50 collectible cards. In Clear Mode you have to clear a given constellation of blocks. Battle Mode is a two player link-cable mode.</story>

    <story>The gameplay of Puzzle Link 2 is generally identical to the first game: Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve. There are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. The game also has link cable support for two players.</story>

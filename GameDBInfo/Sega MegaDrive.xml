  <story>16t is a scrolling platform action game similar to Teddy Boy, in which the player controls a youngster in prison garb named Apple Gaikichi, who must eliminate all the enemies on each stage. Apple&apos;s only method of attack is throwing enormous 16 ton weights (thus the title), which can and will crush enemies in a bloody mess. However, these weights will bounce off each other, so the player must be careful to not let Apple get crushed himself. They are also not entirely unlimited, as the player can only hold five at once, and they must be allowed to recharge when Apple runs out. Enemies on each stage will appear from the top of the screen in waves, through a randomly cycling &quot;slots&quot; meter, and once all slots and enemies have been cleared, the player moves on to the next stage.</story>

  <story>Based on the award-winning TV series, The Adventures of Batman and Robin pits the player against the diabolical Mr. Freeze who wants to free Gotham with a huge ice cannon and his hired help of other Gotham super villains: The Joker, Mad Hatter, and Two-Face. The player can take the role of either Batman or Robin but this choice doesn&apos;t make a difference regarding gameplay.     This is a side-scrolling action game. The player basically walks from left to right while fighting numerous foes in hand-to-hand combat. Weapons which are found during the levels are used to shoot enemies from a greater distance. These weapons can also be upgraded by picking up the corresponding symbols.     There are overall four areas (one for each villain) with three levels each, including a film studio or the Gotham University. While most stages are typical fighting levels with occasional 3D effects there are also a few flying ones where the player uses the Batwing or a jet pack.</story>

  <story>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is the video game adaptation of the 60&apos;s cartoon series staring Bullwinkle, a moose, and Rocky, a flying squirrel.  The game plays out much like an episode of the show.  The story begins at the dedication of the Frostbite Falls Rocky and Bullwinkle museum.  Unfortunately, the not-so-nice Boris and Natasha have disguised themselves as security guards for the museum and managed to steal some of the priceless artifacts.    Bullwinkle and Rocky must track down the stolen artifacts and return order to Frostbite Falls.  Most of the action is of the side-scrolling platformer variety, but along the way, you will get to play lots of mini-games involving characters from the show. During the platforming sections you can switch instantly between the two protagonists. Both play differently: Bullwinkle can throw bombs at enemies and Rocky can fly for short instances.</story>

  <story>The aliens are invading Earth, and it&apos;s up to the &quot;Alien Busters&quot; to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.    When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you&apos;ll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.    When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you&apos;re dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character&apos;s special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can&apos;t use it.    At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building.     You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</story>

  <story>Alisia Dragoon is the female protagonist of this fast-paced platform game. Alisia must destroy an evil demon and avenge her fathers death through eight stages. She has only one weapon to dispose of enemies: thunder magic. This magic is auto-aiming and can track multiple targets. However, the game is quite hard as the levels are loaded with fantasy-inspired monsters. Using thunder magic reduces a magic gauge, meaning you often have to wait for it to recharge. Once fully charged Alisia can unleash a massive rolling blast of lightning across the screen.    During the game, you can improve your magic by picking up potions. There are also four monsters which accompany Alisia: Dragon Frye, Ball O&apos;Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Each has different abilities, deciding which, if any, to use in a given situation is part of the challenge. These monsters, like Alisia herself, are fully upgradeable with power-ups. They can also die if weakened too much, forcing you to hunt for a reviving power-up. You can pause the game and select your companion at any time.</story>

  <story>In this coin-op conversion, you are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With a scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.    The title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.    The game can be played in singleplayer mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</story>

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.  Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a &quot;Skins&quot; game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</story>

You control a female spaceship pilot who is sent on a mission into deep space to save the Earth from an assault by an evil dragon from another galaxy. Moving vertically or horizontally, you must avoid or kill the enemies and make it to the end of the level alive, where a boss battle awaits you. During gameplay, you can switch at any time between two modes: normal spaceship and flying robot. The two forms use different weapons and also have different special abilities, called Arrow Flash. While the spaceship can fire destructive lasers for major damage, the robot can raise a shield that will protect you from enemy attacks for some time and instantly kill anything that touches it. You can either charge Arrow Flash attacks by holding a button for several seconds, or collect icons during your flight to release it quickly afterwards.</story>

Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.    The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</story>

He is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.    What distinguishes Chelnov from other platform games is its use of forced scrolling. This occurs when the screen moves continuously from left to right, forcing players to negotiate the game&apos;s many obstacles and enemies without controlling Chelnov&apos;s speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above, and below, and Chelnov can switch the direction he&apos;s facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons and power-ups, and when they are shot at, the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.</story>

Each player has seven attributes that define their  control and power in both serve, forehand and backhand, as well as their footwork. Four court types are available which affect the speed and bounce of the ball in different ways, and 11 real ATP tournaments are available to play.    There are three game modes: Exhibition match, Exhibition Tournament (where the player competes in a 32-player tournament), ATP Senior Tour Event (where the player chooses one of the retired players and competes in a 8-player tournament) and the ATP Tour, where it&apos;s possible to create a player and develop his skills by winning (or simply doing well) on tournaments, with one extra point on each round won.

  <story>Australian Rugby League is the &quot;sequel&quot; of some sorts of Rugby World Cup 95, but focusing on Rugby League rather than Union. In addition to the 20-team league that names the game and the State of Origin, a competition between two selections of players from New South Wales and Queensland, an European League (composed by twelve teams) and international playoffs (eight) are also available. It is possible to play friendlies, or jump straight to the club competition playoffs.    Gameplay is simple, and focus on quick passing and running rather than kicking to gain distance. The A button controls kicks the ball (tackles in defense), B passes (or changes players) and C rushes and breaks tackles. There are a few additional tricks, such as pressing A+B to perform a short, lobbed kick or A+C to clear the ball from the defense. Kicking from a dead ball situation uses a three-click method. The first sets the bar in motion, the second the strength, and the third the accuracy. The stronger the shot, the less accurate it will be, and the initial position of the kicker also affects the direction of the ball. Each button represents a different ball height, from A (which is the lowest) to C (highest). Weather also affects how the game is played, as high temperatures with hard grounds make longer games tougher on the players (slowing them down) and cold, wet weather makes passing the ball more difficult.</story>

  <story>Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons.     There are three main modes:    1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps.     2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently.     3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits).    While each mode presents it&apos;s own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.</story>

  <story>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they&apos;re soon deep in trouble when they face &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen&apos;s gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:    1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley&apos;s lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.    2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.    3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It&apos;s an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.    4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</story>

  <story>Ball Jacks is a competitive action game taking place in the distant future. Two robot crabs, piloted by men seeking fame and fortune, face opposite each other in an arena. Behind them is a conveyor belt with large metal balls rotating around. The goal is to capture the opponent&apos;s balls and hold them until their timer runs out. Each crab has two claws which operate independently; they can be used to grab balls from the opposite side of the screen, as well as to knock them out of the opponent&apos;s grip. The player must also be careful, as taking a hit from behind will damage the crab, and if it takes too much damage then the crab must return to the pit area to be repaired.    There are several game modes included. The main focus is the World Championship mode, in which one player takes on a succession of increasingly skilled computer opponents. Also available is a two-player versus mode with a number of handicap options. There is also a training mode where the player can freely practice to get a feel for the controls, as well as a time trial mode where the goal is to grab as many balls as possible within the time limit.</story>

  <story>Help Barbie become a great fashion model!  This is an arcade game with many different activities to participate in.    In each level, Barbie starts by going left to right with forced scrolling.  She has a default speed and can speed up as well.  She must avoid moving obstacles by moving up and down and controlling her speed.  If she hits one, she loses a chance and it&apos;s game over if she runs out of chances.  She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.    There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot.  You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level.  You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit.  You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these.  You are awarded points for each correct match.    When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice.  This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.    Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left.  On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up.  This brings you to another magazine cover.  You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie&apos;s hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover.  Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.    When you reach the left side of the level, you must then do Barbie&apos;s runway walk that you were given earlier.  You are awarded points for each station at which you perform the correct move.    Barbie then continues to the next level.  There are a total of four: Barbie driving down the street, skating on the beach, walking through a ski resort and walking through the park.</story>

  <story>This game consists of five 3-day tournaments at four lakes. The mission is to catch as much large bass as possible. Once the day of the fishing tournament is over, the five largest bass that were caught get weighed and are compared to the other fisherman&apos;s catches. The one with the heaviest catch is the winner.    The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the player can either go to the bait shop, practice pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish finders, and boat engines are available for purchase. The practice pond mode is just where the player can cut his teeth on the game mechanics without consequence.    The tournament mode is the main part of the game. Players start out in a fishing boat. Some of the factors that can affect your fishing are temperature, wind speed, water clarity and time of day. After casting the line, the game goes from an above the lake view to a side view of the lake water depths. Then it&apos;s just up to the player to attract the fish with the bait, and after the fish is caught on the hook, reel it in.</story>

  <story>The Joker lives again in SunSoft&apos;s sequel to their NES   original. The Joker has somehow managed to escape from Arkham Asylum once again, and Batman must fight him across seven stages to restore peace to Gotham City.    Batman carries a gauntlet shooting basic bullets by default. This can be upgraded with weapon powerups located in boxes throughout the level, giving access to homing and energy weapons. Every upgrade weapon can be charged up for a secondary attack, different for each weapon. Batman also has a slide useful against most enemies and some bosses.     Boss fights introduce a system where life is measured by points instead of tick marks or bars. In these sections, Batman has significantly more health, and can take many more hits when rumbling with these stronger foes.    Levels include a snowy landscape, moving train, military base, and sewers. Two levels require you to run and dodge explosions while vehicles keep pace in the background. Some levels also have Batman activate a jetpack and play through a short side-scrolling shooter.     This game is one of the few Batman games that was not based directly on a movie or television series.</story>

  <story>The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the 1989 movie.    The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.    Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing Missiles (A button).    Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).</story>

  <story>The Genesis title based on Batman Returns is a platform game in which the Dark Knight must traverse five action-filled levels on his way to confront the Penguin.    Areas include the rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck&apos;s department store, the Red Triangle Circus and the sewers. Besides run-and-jump action, there&apos;s also a lot of combat in the game, as many of the Penguin&apos;s henchmen stand in Batman&apos;s way. He can knock them out with punches and kicks and a number of extra weapons stored in his utility belt. These include batarangs, which come in standard and self-seeking varieties, and smoke bombs that stun enemies for a while. In addition, Batman can shoot from his grappling gun and unleash a deadly swarm of bats towards enemies. All of these weapons have limited ammo, however, that must be collected.    Other special tools Batman can use include the grappling hook to reach high places or swing across chasms, and his cape, which can be used to slow falls.    Each of the five levels features several boss battles against Catwoman, the Penguin and others.</story>

  <story>A one on one fighting game seen from an isometric perspective. All beasts or dragons have two basic attacks: a punch and a tail attack, as well as a special attack that can only be performed while a certain icon is displayed. During close combat, pressing the A or C button rapidly will result in a throwing or choking attack. There is no visible health bar, but three icons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Once a dragon is knocked down for a longer moment, one icon turns red. Once all icons are red, the fight is lost. The battle arena is surrounded by an electric fence, that opponents can be thrown into and which can also be used to initiate jump attacks.    There are two modes of play: Match and Tournament. Match is a single match for one or two players, where several different dragons are available. Tournament sees the player starting out with a week dragon who has to fight increasingly difficult battles and increase his stats (Power, Speed and Stamina).  After every other battle, a shop can be visited that offers different items including food that increases Power, Speed or Stamina, Data Disks that contain information on other Dragons and more. After visiting the shop, Dragons can be trained. The training consists of simply selecting an attribute to be increased. At a few points in the game, it is possible to splice the player&apos;s Dragon&apos;s genes which that of a defeated Opponent to gain different abilities.</story>

It is not a sequel to the first game, as both games were released in the same year. This title largely retells the story from Beast&apos;s perspective. It starts with Beast living in a castle in the dark woods with his servants (Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts). A powerful storm hits the castle and enchants all animals around it. Initially the beast needs to protect the magic rose against the creatures. Soon, Belle and her father Maurice become involved, and eventually the villagers who invade the castle.    The game takes place in Beast&apos;s castle and the surrounding woods. Through side-scrolling platform gameplay Beast can attack from three different stances (crouch, stand up, jump) and unleash a limited amount of roars that stun enemies for a short time. After regular levels, a sequence with a boss follows. There are also a few mini-games where Beast needs to finish a puzzle and catch rosebuds. Certain events are time limited. The game keeps track of the player&apos;s score, based on defeated enemies and collected treasures. There is an unlimited amount of continues and the story is told through static, drawn cut-scenes between missions.</story>

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.    As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</story>

  <story>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself.     Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat &apos;em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama&apos;s island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown.     During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a &quot;taunt&quot; that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it&apos;s game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen.     Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player.     The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.    In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</story>

  <story>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.    Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can&apos;t jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.    Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak&apos;s back.    In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot &apos;em up sections taking place underwater ��� completing these earns bonuses.</story>

You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).     Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can&apos;t shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial.

  <story>Starting as a young Roman legionnaire in 275BC, your job is to conquer the known world through force or diplomacy, fighting on land and sea.     Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map.     One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship.     Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let&apos;s just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province.     When you enter a province you don&apos;t yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn&apos;t very likely, and you&apos;ll often have to fight.     When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander&apos;s voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat.     Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.</story>

The player picks one of four different bowlers and the ball they want to use, then heads out to the lanes. The player controls the throw, spin, and power by stopping bars at the right time.    The game includes three different play modes: standard bowling; spare mode, where a handful of pins are placed with the goal being to pick up a spare; and bonus mode, where specific pins are worth different amounts of points. Each mode can be played against either the computer or a friend, and there are three different lane types available. There is also a practice mode for each of the game types.    The Japanese version, Boogie Woogie Bowling, is largely the same but features different, more anime-style characters to play as (including a robot for no explained reason), as well as minor tweaks to the timing for throws.</story>

With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes.     There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:    1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.    2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:    1. 14.1 Challenge ��� After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.    2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line.

Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.    4. Equal Offence ��� Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.    5. Three Pool ��� Only have 3 balls on the table.

Ten Ball (2-8 Players)  ��� Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.    10. Rotation (2-8 Players)  ��� Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points).

  <story>Similar to Chase H.Q. in some ways: same gameplay, same number of stages, and same objective. If you haven&apos;t heard of this game before, you basically drive on a freeway trying to catch up with five criminals who have committed felonies, but time is against you. If you catch up with the criminal&apos;s vehicle, you can ram into it to do some damage. If you do enough damage, the car malfunctions and you arrest the suspect. You can also use up to three turbo boosters that comes equipped with the car if you are far behind the suspect.    However, what makes this game different is the fact that you can choose one of three vehicles to drive: a sports car, 4-wheel drive, and a semi truck, with each one of them having their advantages and disadvantages. For example, the truck may be slow in speed, but can do a massive amount of damage. The sports car, on the other hand, can perform at higher speeds, but has a poor attack efficiency. As well as passing cars, your task is made difficult by obstacles, such as barricades, on the freeway. Finally, some vehicles in the game will have someone shooting at you. And watch out for the helicopter that attempts to drop bombs on you.</story>

The idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.    The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.    There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</story>

  <story>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches.     Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.    The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</story>

  <story>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up &apos;combos&apos; - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.    As well as the normal game mode, there is also a &apos;flash&apos; mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</story>

In the Arcade, Versus, and Time Trial modes, you can test your skills against an opponent, a clock, or a specific task such as removing a particular jewel. New features include a rising bar that can be used to annoy opponents and magical items that have strategic value to alter the outcome mid-game.</story>

  <story>Sketch Turner was a starving comic book artist, living with his pet rat Roadkill... that is until a lightning storm mysteriously brought his cartoon villain, Mortus, to life and imprisoned Sketch within the pages of his own comic book. Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...    Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you&apos;re inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.    The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he&apos;s progressing.</story>

  <story>Linus had crash landed on a distant planet called Earth, and made his way back home again. Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you&apos;ve cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.</story>

  <story>In this game, you play the role of the Crystal Pony. One day, her pony friends decide to make a party in a nearby castle. But an evil witch has captured and imprisoned all the ponies. The only pony who is still free is Crystal Pony. She must now carefully explore the surroundings, find gems that are scattered in various places, and use them in places where the ponies are captured to release them.    You navigate your pony through various locations, collecting horseshoes on your way and &quot;paying&quot; them at level gates to pass to another location. You can explore the locations in any order you wish, traveling directly between them or using teleportation pictures. The game has more adventure than action elements. Crystal Pony cannot die in the game; if an enemy hits her, she merely loses one of her horseshoes. The only battles are against the witch, occurring every time you use a gem at the correct place. The pony would automatically jump over obstacles, but you can also make her jump with a corresponding button. You can get extra items by interacting with various objects and characters, pressing the action button.</story>

  <story>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.    Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the &apos;downs&apos; are replaced by the bomb&apos;s heat gradually increasing towards &apos;critical&apos;. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to &apos;cool&apos;. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.    Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released.

  <story>&quot;Doomsday&quot; is here and only Superman can stop him. Unfortunately in doing so he gets killed himself. Now four other characters emerge, each claiming to be the real hero. The story starts you off with Superman, then Steel, the Eradicator, the Cyborg, and Superboy. Each character has slightly varied moves so different strategies apply when playing as them.    The gameplay is basically that of a standard beat-em-up, with the punches, throws and specials moves.</story>

  <story>In the future all intergalactic disputes must be settled by a duel to the death. Nine galactic superpowers take control of the flight paths, leaving the Federation unable to operate. To regain the paths, the Federation sends in Barrett Jade inside a giant cyborg. He has to battle to death and defeat the other nine superpowers&apos; contestants to regain control.    Death Duel is a tactical side-scrolling first-person shooter. The game consists of different time-limited rounds against a single enemy. Before each game, the player can spend Pheelae (money) on repairs and determine what weapons to take into battle. Each opponent has specific weaknesses and they can hide behind walls on the battlefield. To take them out, Jade needs to choose the most effective weapons and target specific parts before he runs out of time and ammo. Weapons include missiles, rockets, grenades that slow the opponent down, a machine gun and more. Only three weapons can be acquired at all times. Between missions there are short gallery shooting mini-games where additional money can be acquired.</story>

  <story>In this game you play as Chuck D. Head, the product of a mad, but benevolent, scientist.  Chuck looks a lot like a mummy, except he is missing an important part: a head.  Fortunately, he is equipped with a set of eyes and a weird punching appendage in the middle of his chest.     Chuck&apos;s weird features come in handy when, one day, this evil guy named Max D. Cap emerges from the underworld.  Max quickly takes over our world, and only Chuck can stop him.    The gameplay in Decapattack is of the side-scrolling platformer variety.  You play through several colorful worlds, collect useful power up potions, and deliver a beat down to the ugly bosses.</story>

  <story>Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. As with the movie, the game takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. John Spartan is the country��s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.    Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of &quot;cryocons&quot; released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.    The Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.</story>

This is a platform shooter/&quot;beat-&apos;em-up&quot; game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can&apos;t approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</story>

Another aspect of the license is that the variety of offensive and defensive strategies and formations for player and AI use are pulled from the pages of Coach Vitale&apos;s own playbook.    The game features a 3/4 pseudo-3D perspective similar to that available on the SNES console in Mode 7. There are 32 college teams to choose from in four conferences, and games are played by official NCAA rules. Available gameplay modes include Single Game, 2-on-2, Slamfest (a simple slam-dunk contest), and Tournament. The AI can take control of defense, and the game can be played without foul rules.</story>

  <story>Westwood Studios&apos; real-time strategy classic Dune II received a major overhaul when ported to the Sega Genesis. While the basic concept remains the same, the game features all-new graphics, streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree as well as completely new levels.    As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice, constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.    The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit, for example.    The tech tree has been simplified: Among other changes, concrete slabs are only available in the 4x4 size, there is only one type of vehicle factory and the advanced units do not require an IX research center anymore.    Finally, the progression of levels in the console version is strictly linear, as there is no choice of the next map to be played as in the original version.</story>

  <story>The story of the game is connected to that of  El Viento. Earnest Evans is a brave treasure hunter. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist who searched for three legendary idols in the 1930s. It was said that those idols could bring disaster upon the Earth if fallen into the wrong hands. But despite his efforts, he could never find even one of the idols. Now it&apos;s up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest...    This is an action platform game in which you control Earnest Evans, armed with his trusty whip. The hero can jump, climb ropes, crouch, and crawl. There are plenty of obstacles on the levels (bottomless pits, spikes, crushing bridges, lava, etc.), as well as gangsters and monsters to dispose of.</story>

  <story>Ecco Jr. is a prequel to Ecco the Dolphin, set during his childhood. Together with his friends Tara the Whale and Kitney the Dolphin, Ecco goes looking for the legendary blue whale. Released after the two main Ecco games, this title is geared towards younger children with simplified gameplay, lacking the difficulty of the other Ecco games. The game also contains a number of educational facts about dolphins.    Set in the same underwater world, players choose one of the three characters to solve a series of challenges. These all involve harmless exploration and solving small puzzles with no foes or violent gameplay. The characters need to use their abilities to locate animals, herd seahorses, retrieve a sea lion&apos;s lost ball, swim through rings and locate glyphs. After completing the main tasks, a large glyph needs to be located to end the level. The characters can be switched at any time during gameplay, but they all have the same abilities. One button is used to send out a sonar pulse to locate items while another boosts the animal. Most levels take less than a minute to complete and there are eighteen levels in total.</story>

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.    The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</story>

  <story>Evander Holyfield&apos;s &quot;Real Deal&quot; Boxing is a boxing simulation.  Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson&apos;s Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. The game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handle by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the top of the screen.    Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 30-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter&apos;s color of skin, trunks and hair, haircut, dominant hand and stats emphasis. Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.    During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds&apos; breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.    Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent&apos;s head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching each other on a regular basis.</story>

  <story>In Exodus you need to guide Moses through 100 different levels in order to reach the promised land. The gameplay features an action/strategy part similar to Boulder Dash, and a question part. In the action part, you need to collect five question marks and enough Manna to open the exit of the maze-like screens. There are a variety of boulders, walls, dirt, and other obstacles in the way. Some obstacles can be destroyed when moses uses his staff to say the word of god, other obstacles can be pushed out of the way, and some you must find a way around. You need to be careful when navigating around the screens, if you cause any boulders to fall and they land on you a life is lost. Also wandering about are a variety of enemies which can be destroyed or avoided, but will cost you one life if you get caught. When you find all the question marks and manna you need, the exit appears and you can move on to the question phase. Here you will be asked five multiple choice questions about the book of Exodus. Answering the questions correctly will reward you with bonuses, such as extra lives.</story>

  <story>The second in the series features campaigns in Lybia, the Persian Gulf, The Middle East and Vietnam, making for a total of 250,000 miles of potential action and danger. Primary and secondary aerial and ground-based targets must be destroyed on each of these.

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy&apos;s adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone.     Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore&apos;s puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.</story>

  <story>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football&apos;s world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as &quot;isometric&quot;) viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.    Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</story>

Also new, a battery backup allowed to save up to four competitions in the cartridge, replacing passwords. For those who want to settle things the fast way, a Penalty Shootout training mode was added.    While graphically the game only received minor changes to the isometric sprite engine, gameplay feature new moves such as volley kicks and more detailed headers (now more effective), as well as general controls being more responsive facilitating passing play, and goalkeepers now are smarter when chasing balls.

  <story>&quot;Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.    There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game&apos;s commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.    The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system    FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it&apos;s possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you&apos;re not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</story>

Other icons appear when various other enemies or buildings are destroyed.  These power-ups will float around the screen for several seconds. Grabbing them with your plane earns you a weapon upgrade or bonus points.    The standard weapons are the bomb and the Wide Shot.  As power-ups are obtained the number of shots per blast can increase up to 16.  The Wide Shot is a comparatively weak weapon that usually requires multiple hits to take an enemy down.    The Shark Beam is a green laser that fires in a spiral pattern and the strongest weapon of all is the Super Fire.  It will fire continuously while the fire button is held.  Power-ups increase its beam count to 4.</story>

  <story>The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump&apos;n Run set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard&apos;s apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.    Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink&apos;s ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the &quot;recipes&quot; which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more.   Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</story>

In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.</story>

The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.     There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, &quot;Arcade&quot; allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas &quot;Grand Prix&quot; only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.

The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren&apos;t happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it.  They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth&apos;s last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.    Why don&apos;t the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves?  It&apos;s not exactly clear.    So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.</story>

  <story>General Chaos is an arcade-style squad RTS where the player controls a team of five soldiers in a limited battleground, in a classic Red (General Havoc, headquarters in Viceria) vs Blue (General Chaos, in Moronica) all out war. The goal of the game is to push the frontline to the enemy headquarters, by winning individual battles and then beat them in their own capital.    There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their weapon of choice and range of attack: the Gunner (machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher (rocket launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades that can be thrown over barricades), Scorcher (flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster (dynamite sticks, close range). Before each battle, players can choose the composition of their team from one out of four choices: Assault team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of just two soldiers which have different controls) and Demolition.    Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button being used to fire at the nearest enemy, B to move to a the pointer location and C to cycle through soldiers. Using the commando team changes the controls, with the directional pad controlling a soldier directly, with B being used to call the other soldier nearby. While basic commands are simple, the player must deal with things such as distance from target and angle of attack to succeed.  If two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, they engage in a brawl (indicated by a cloud of dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the players are in direct control of the soldiers: A punches, B kicks and C blocks. Every downed soldier can can be rescued if there are enough medics available, earned at the end of each battle depending on how well the player did.     Up to four players can play, cooperatively or against each other.</story>

  <story>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.    Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.    By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.    All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</story>

When the Ghostbusters face off against a boss ghost, they have the ability to trap them the traditional way.    Peter, Ray and Egon, each have different abilities, and can purchase weapon and life upgrades from shops throughout the levels.  Other familiar faces make an appearance, as Slimer offers power-ups, and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man returns to settle the score from the movie.

A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess&apos; castle and her village under attack by Lucifer&apos;s forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer&apos;s laser beams.    Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer&apos;s palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess&apos; soul and bring her back to life! And it won&apos;t matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn&apos;t going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.    Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.</story>

Machines of destruction called &quot;maneuver cepters&quot; have been developed as the primary force, but recently a mysterious maneuver cepter has appeared in the northern territories. It is known by the name of &quot;Granada&quot;, and has been destroying the weapons of the factions on both sides. You are this machine&apos;s pilot, a man by the name of Leon Todo.    Granada is a free-roaming scrolling shooter. You control the titular maneuver cepter Granada as you make your way through each stage, destroying the enemy&apos;s weapons. You have a map that tells you where your targets are on the stage, and once all the targets have been destroyed a large boss enemy appears which must also be destroyed. You are equipped with a standard cannon, as well as a more powerful blaster that will actually push your machine backwards with the recoil. There are also assist pickups which will follow you and reflect any shots you fire at it toward the nearest enemies.    Of special note is the fixed cannon feature. Using this feature, you can hold the direction of fire while still moving freely. The game has nine stages and three difficulty levels.</story>

The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.    In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo&apos;s dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.</story>

  <story>Greatest Heavyweights is a boxing game featuring the ex heavyweight champions Evander Holyfield, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali, Floyd Patterson, Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey. Their likeness and real fighting style are simulated by the game.    The game is an enhanced version of Evander Holyfield&apos;s &quot;Real Deal&quot; Boxing, being also played in a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. This time, a 2.5D camera is shown at the top of the screen.    There are three game modes:    1. Exhibition: one or two players can fight a single match.    2. Tournament: one player chooses among the eight heavyweight champs available in a eight-man tournament against the remaining seven.    3. Career: one player creates a character who starts as the #30 of the ranking, fighting his way up against fictional characters. During character creation, players can choose the fighter&apos;s color of skin (which now includes some unnatural colors such as green and blue), trunks and hair, haircut, size of body and stats emphasis (power, speed and stamina). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats. After reaching the #1 in the ranking, the player will be challenged by each one of the eight greatest heavyweight champions.    During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds&apos; breaks, fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their sides.    Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can be aimed at the opponent&apos;s head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their opponents. Each one of the heavyweight champions has his own set of personal taunts. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching each other on a regular basis.    The game plays sensibly faster than Evander Holyfield&apos;s, and the character animation is more detailed. There&apos;s a replay feature included, and the fights are announced by Michael Buffer&apos;s voice.</story>

  <story>This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.    In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.    The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options. After using a continue, the player immediately receives a &quot;Special&quot; power-up granting four wingmen.</story>

Growl is a one-player game, in which you control one of four characters (Gen, Burn, Khan, and Jack) and you must defeat these evil poachers by dealing with them with your fists. However, there are weapons that can be found, including grenades, rocket launchers, whips, swords, guns, and shotguns, which you get once an enemy drops them on the ground, so you can use these weapons against them. If you manage to get one of the guns, you can shoot enemies with a limited supply of ammo. Once the ammo runs out, your only option is to pistol-whip them.    Also, you can pick up crates and barrels and haul it at enemies to knock them down. Along the way, you&apos;ll encounter several cases of animal cruelty, such as two men whipping a lion. Stop the animal cruelty, and the animals will help you in your quest to defeat these evil poachers.</story>

  <story>Hard Drivin&apos; is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass...     The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on.     Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is &quot;reset&quot; and you get up to speed again.     The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</story>

  <story>The ghost of a teenager seeks revenge against a snobbish family.  Your job is to scare them out of their house(s).  They can&apos;t see you so your only means of scaring them is by possessing various objects throughout the household.  For example, possessing a piece of furniture would cause something to fly out from it and possessing an object would make it come alive in some way or another.  You need to act quickly because you have something called &quot;ecto&quot; which acts as the fuel that allows you to roam the real world.  You&apos;re awarded more ecto each time a family member exists the room.  The more scares you did, the more ecto you gain.  Losing all ecto sends you to the underworld where you have to regain your ecto to full capacity in order to go back into the real world.</story>

  <story>In this isometric football game, 50 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls.    While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his &quot;standard players&quot;, who won&apos;t do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:    1. The Marker: can latch on an opposing player, stopping him from running away with the ball;    2. Goalkeeper 1: more capable of stopping shots than the regular goalkeeper;    3. Barger: this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path;    4. Tricky: capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet, avoiding tackles;    5. The Cheat: while it&apos;s hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking a defenders&apos; leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he&apos;s carrying it or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he&apos;s trying to pull an offensive foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties);    6. Passer: capable of feeding forwards with laser-precision passes;     7. Striker 1: capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from virtually any position in the offensive area;    8. Striker 2: best used from positions directly in front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal;    9. Goalkeeper 2: features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers;    In Exhibition games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa.</story>

  <story>In an era of frequent alien attacks, the Earth has a unified Government, which relies on a line of cyborgs known as the Heavy Dolls for defense. The greatest of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous training regime.    You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.    Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</story>

  <story>In the year 2998, humanity has finally reached the stars, and was able to build a prosperous, peaceful society. However, a space matter known as the Black Nebula began to spread, threatening to engulf the galaxies controlled by humans. It turned out that a robotic dictator named Super Mech was behind this occurrence. The Earth sends Captain Lancer, a skillful pilot navigating the powerful CNCS1 aircraft, equipped with the most powerful weapon: the Hellfire...    This is a horizontal space shooter, with the traditional premise of a lone pilot traversing hostile areas and out-manoeuvring and/or destroying quick and numerous enemies. What sets this shooter apart from many other horizontal space shooters is that you choose the direction of your shots at any time between forward, backward, upward+downward and 4-way diagonal. The 4-way diagonal shot is usually the most effective and makes for some interesting gameplay setups, such as stationary guns you can only reach by passing them (while avoiding their shots) and then placing yourself diagonally above them. There is also a bomb to take out multiple enemies. The game has a standard set of pickups: P icons for powering the weapons, S icons for increasing ship speed, B icons for bombs, and score icons.</story>

  <story>The premise is that two opposing forces are in combat with one another. Each player controls a jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may turn into a ground based soldier. These ground soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not affect bases. To take over bases scattered across the map (and ultimately, the enemy base), players must purchase new units and transport them to certain positions. In this way, the player acts more like a transport and management for different types of units rather than a combat character themselves. If the plane is ever destroyed, it restarts at the player&apos;s base location. As previously mentioned, a level is complete when either side&apos;s base is lost to the opposing forces.</story>

  <story>Hit the Ice is a fast-paced, high-impact hockey game based on the 1990 arcade game from Williams. Having more in common with Midway&apos;s Arch Rivals than any sane hockey simulation, this arena is no place for penalties, and no place for wimps. While the idea is still to somehow put the puck into the opposing team&apos;s goal, each team only has three players, there is a heavy focus on checking, and it is possible to do a &quot;super shot&quot; which is strong enough to send the goalie into the net along with the puck.    Available are exhibition and tournament modes for one or two players. Two players can even team up to take on the computer. The TurboGrafx-16 release also adds a four-player mode, while the Gameboy version adds a &quot;shot race&quot; mode where the player must get a certain number of goals as quickly as possible.</story>

  <story>Featuring in a children&apos;s TV cartoon, The Hurricanes are the most revered team in the World Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.    Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to &apos;influence&apos; a license of a show about brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.    In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player&apos;s foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.    The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 lives takes you back tot he last restart point - losing one of your continues takes you to the start of the world.</story>

  <story>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.    Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You&apos;re not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of   isometric death await.    The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.    The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you&apos;ve got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn&apos;t empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you&apos;ve got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</story>

  <story>Ishido is a solitaire board game played with tiles (like Shanghai).  The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play.  It is a solitaire game.  There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature.  Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question...the question is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (4 way match).      There is also a &quot;construction set&quot; where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds.  But the game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</story>

  <story>Izzy&apos;s Quest for the Olympic Rings is the official game of the mascot of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his world.    The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms  him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.    Graphics and sound remain faithful to the cartoony origins of the mascot.</story>

You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical &quot;jump and run&quot; game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective.

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.    The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</story>

They fought Jardine until there was no more than four remaining. The four combined their powers to form the Elemental Blade with which the demon king could be slain. At this time the Jewel Master was summoned to wield the blade, however the blade has been lost and the rings of the elemental masters have been scattered across Mythgard, all save two. The Jewel Master must gather the other ten rings of the Elemental Masters and reclaim the blade and ultimately do battle with the demon king.    The gameplay is based on fighting a lot of monsters in classic arcade platform kind of way. To do this you have at your disposal rings, two which you begin with and further more that you gain along the way. Each ring is of one of the four elements and by combining them you gain different effects. Rings of opposite elements cancel each other but you have to hands and two attack buttons so you can use say water on the one and fire on the other. The rings are also different in strength which further adds some complexity.</story>

  <story>Joe Montana Football for the Genesis is an action-oriented football game starring Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49&apos;ers. Play a single game, a 2-minute drill or try to win the SEGA Bowl. Play against a friend or against the computer.    Both on the offensive end as well as on the defensive end there are 24 predefined plays for you to choose from (you can&apos;t create your own). If you don&apos;t know which play is appropriate you can always choose &quot;Joe&apos;s Play&quot; - a hint for inexperienced coaches. The nature of the gameplay is very &quot;arcade-like&quot;. The game doesn&apos;t have GM functions, players statistics, player attributes, substitutions or any other coaching options. Just choose your scheme and execute it.    On the defensive side you can control any player you want, on the attack you control either the quarterback, a receiver, a running back or the kicker.    The game doesn&apos;t have a NFL license, so you&apos;ll play against Detroit or Chicago instead of the Detroit Lions &amp; the Chicago Bears. Joe Montana is the only NFL player (actually he&apos;s the only one with a name).</story>

  <story>Unlike the first computer versions, this game originated on consoles and focuses on the action on the field instead of detailed strategy. There is still a detailed range of moves available, all grouped for quick selection.    Game play modes include regular season, playoffs and sudden death. The game features 16 regular teams plus one All-Madden team, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Play actions include selecting a pass recipient as a play unfolds, block tackles, dives and sackings. Different weather conditions come into play when it&apos;s wet, snowy or muddy.</story>

  <story>Two of the greatest icons of the Golden Age of the NBA match up in this game. On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird&apos;s incredible accuracy from the outside.     While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.    While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird&apos;s stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan&apos;s speed and jumping abilities?</story>

  <story>Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.  The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.    The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.</story>

  <story>The Sega Genesis game based on the Jurassic Park movie/book differs from the games made by Ocean for other platforms. Basically, Sega&apos;s Jurassic Park is a side-scrolling action game.  You jump from platform to platform, pick up weapons and health items, and try to make it to the end of the level with all your lives intact.    This version of Jurassic Park does feature an interesting twist, however.  You can play it either as Dr. Grant, or as a Velociraptor.  The story and level design changes based on which character you use.</story>

  <story>Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.    The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.</story>

Each of the 32 teams in the game has a distinct style of play, ensuring that no two games are alike. Each team also has &quot;key players&quot;, such as Liberos and Wingers, who play a pivotal role in how that team plays. Kick Off 3 offers two styles of play: Arcade and Simulation.

He can change his shape into various other forms (hence the &quot;Chameleon&quot;). This gives him special abilities which must be used to pass each of the game&apos;s 100+ stages.    An interesting point about Kid Chameleon is that the game has 100+ levels (most of which are very, very difficult) which must be played in sequence AND there is no save feature or password feature - which means completing this game would be a major feat of endurance (and patience).</story>

  <story>As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.    Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you&apos;re his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.    You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you&apos;ll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you&apos;ll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king&apos;s castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don&apos;t have enough for your army&apos;s salary, they will desert or turn against you.    There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King&apos;s Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.    As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you&apos;re defeated, you respawn back at the king&apos;s castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.</story>

  <story>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in &quot;Project 5&quot;, a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.     With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe&apos;s intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.    While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe&apos;s best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.     The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</story>

  <story>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.    You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</story>

  <story>The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.    Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.     The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.    Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems.     Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.</story>

  <story>STORY  The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).    GAMEPLAY  Choosing Sides  In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as the &quot;rebels&quot; - the American Continental Army or as the &quot;Crown&quot; - the British Royal Army.    Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading Commander-in-Chief:    The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington.  The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.    Revolutionary Politics  Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the fleet and recruiting new regiments.    Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to &quot;control the seas&quot; which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury.     The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the American Indians: [1] Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control) [2] Loyalist Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: The French will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army: The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.    Revolutionary Combat  The Top-down turned based combat introduces units available in the Revolutionary War: Infantry, Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). Combat near shores may also be joined by Naval units: Fleet and Fires Ships.</story>

  <story>Young Simba just can&apos;t wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba&apos;s father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.    The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie.     As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge.     As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you&apos;re skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen).     The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</story>

  <story>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.    The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.    The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</story>

  <story>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.    You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint.  Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.    You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word &apos;Esprit&apos; from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip.     You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.</story>

  <story>Playcalling expert John Madden again licenses Electronic Arts&apos; flagship football simulation. New features for 1998 include more advanced Quarterback functions such as the ability to play lob passes and adjust timing patterns, and more instinctive AI features to adjust as the match goes on. Squad features have also been advanced, with the opportunity to create plays and trade them.    Gameplay is much the same as the other editions, with the full season on offer as well as playoffs and the Superbowl. Everything is presented TV-style, with play-by-play analysis and reports. The contemporary NFL teams are joined by great squads of the past.</story>

  <story>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you&apos;re racing against the clock.</story>

  <story>Italian-born Mario Andretti is one of the most successful racing drivers in the US scene, and five of his relatives have also raced professionally. This game allows you to sample Indy cars, stock cars and sprint cars, all of which have been graced by Andrettis. The physics are customized to each of these, so expect sprint cars to slide around on the dirt tracks, and the slipstream effect is detectable.    There are 27 computer-controlled cars with individual profiles, and 8 cars to choose from in each race, with varying engine, grip, brakes and pit crew standards. You can view the action either from behind the car, or from the nose. In longer races you must monitor the pit strategy, with the options of a splash &apos;n&apos; dash stop if your tires are still fine.</story>

  <story>This hockey game contains an exhibition, tournament, shootout, and a fight mode. It also has 16 teams that represent the cities of real NHL teams but the game does not contain either real NHL teams or players.    Exhibition mode is just a one on one matchup between 2 teams.    In the tournament mode, a team must win to advance to the next round. If a team loses they are eliminated.     The shootout mode consists of two teams  who take turns taking shots at the goalie and whoever scores the most goals  wins.     Fight mode consists of two hockey players fighting each other until either of their energy bars runs out. This mode is good to get some practice because when the fight happens in a hockey game the loser of the fight gets sent to the penalty box.    There are three skill levels and four period-lengths to choose from. The game also has an option to make the referee either blind, fair, or tough which affects the frequency of penalties.</story>

  <story>Based on the character developed by Belgian cartoon artist Franquin, this platform features the player controlling Marsupilami, a strange animal with a large tail, who was poached along with Bonelli the Elephant from the Palombian jungle by Bring M. Backalive and sold to a Circus. Seizing the opportunity when the animal trainer fell asleep, Marsupilami got the key using his long tail and released all animals, and with the help of their Palombian friends No��, Bip and Sarah tries to return to Palombia.    While it might seem a typical platform game at first sight, it  includes a twist: Instead of dozens of enemies, Marsupilami has to guide Bonelli through gaps and other obstacles (not much different than the Earthworm Jim levels where Jim has to steer Peter Puppy to safety), by shaping his tail intro stairs, bridges or an umbrella, but to do so, he must first collect an icon with the abilities required to complete the level, up to four on each. Always available is the ability to shape into a giant fist not only to swat guards and other enemies away, but also to change Bonelli&apos;s direction. The player also collects fruits along the way, which not only provide extra points at the end of the level, but can be dropped out to slow down Bonelli. Each level is timed, so the player can&apos;t make many mistakes, even if some time bonus items are occasionally available.</story>

  <story>In the land of Coni, its inhabitants lived in harmony. At its center lies a mountain called &quot;Peace&quot;, in which an amusement park known as &quot;Marvel Land&quot; resides. This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land, imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.    A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not, you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.    You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones, which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food. The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them.     During the game, you can open any treasure chests that you may find along the way, and release power-ups which include boots that make you increase your speed, dragon wings that enable you to jump higher and giving you the ability to glide to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the &quot;clone&quot; attack. Hidden throughout the sections are warp doors that can either take your backwards or forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section of a world has you riding a roller coaster, in which you must stay on the cars while avoiding signs and enemies.    The last section of each world has Talmit going through the castle to reach the end-of-world boss. Unlike other platform games where you must defeat bosses with weapons, you are challenged to various mini-games starting from &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot; through to the Musical Chairs variant. If you win one of the mini-games, you are able to free one of the Fairies, and obtain a crystal ball that you need to defeat King Mole. You then proceed to the Bonus Stage where you must collect shooting stars for points. If you lose a mini-game, you are transported back to the start of the last section.</story>

  <story>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler  after the master wizard&apos;s death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters&apos; abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</story>

  <story>A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, Math Blaster: In Search of Spot is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn maths while having fun.    The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals, percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets (present in the PC version only).    Math Blaster&apos;s friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.    The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games) strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately, for practice or for score.    The activities are as follows:    1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the tractor beam to collect space trash.    2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash you collected into fuel.    3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster&apos;s jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels, monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.    4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien&apos;s spaceship displays an equation, and the four portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship. Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time limit.    Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a high score board for their account.</story>

  <story>Mega Bomberman is a top down strategy game. Control your Bomberman through various levels defeating multiple enemies and plenty of bosses. Each level consist of blocks for exploding and some blocks that don&apos;t explode. At times you will need the non-exploding blocks as shelter. The blocks that do explode reveal power-ups and eggs.     The eggs are the unique twist to this version of Bomberman. When you get a egg, it hatches into a kangaroo. There are multiple kangaroo types, each with their own unique ability. You hop on the back of the kangaroo and utilize it&apos;s ability. If you happen to walk into an explosion the kangaroo takes the damage and dies and you continue to live.     Another unique feature in multiplayer is you can choose your character. Pick one of 9 such as Miner, Tiny, Fat, Cop, Punk(On cover), Lady, Old man, Robot and the original Bomberman.    After selecting your character get ready for battle as you are placed in 1 of the 4 corners of the arena. Now just blow your way through the blocks and attack some opponents. Watch out for their bombs and remember to dodge your own. There are also many arena&apos;s to choose from. Each arena has it&apos;s own twist such as trap doors, an igloo to hide in, conveyor belts and more.</story>

  <story>Menacer 6-Game Cartridge was released as a pack-in cartridge for the Menacer light gun. It is a compilation of six games:    1. Pest Control: in this game the player has to defend a pizza from the attack of assorted bugs. The player smokes the bugs while controlling a spotlight, but it is also possible to see the whole table while pressing a second button (in this case, it won&apos;t be possible to use the insecticide). The game is over when the pizza is all eaten. Different bugs will appear throughout the levels, such as some big ones which explode in smaller ones when shot.    2. Space Station Defender: the player has to shoot aliens inside pods which appear on the screen in a given sequence and in specific positions. As the player follows the pattern, he has to reload the weapon by aiming the lower end of the screen where &quot;power&quot; can be read. There&apos;s also a random mode, where all pods appear at the same time and the player has to guess the order in which they&apos;ll open. The aliens shoot back if the player takes much time to shoot them. Once in a while a little flying saucer will cross the screen; shooting it will give the player a shield point. The game is over when player&apos;s life is depleted.    3. Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!: this game is set in Toejam &amp; Earl&apos;s universe. As the screen scrolls right, Toejam has to shoot tomatoes at enemies such as the Cupid, the Dentist, the Boogie Man, the little Devil and so on. There are also special items to shoot, like bombs which will kill all enemies at the screen or tomato baskets which will give ammunition. For each level there&apos;s a target score to achieve. In advanced levels the enemies will shoot back. The game is over when Toejam&apos;s life is depleted.    4. Whack Ball: this is some sort of a Breakout game. The player controls a paddle and has to bounce a ball against a frame of blocks. Once a block is touched by the ball, its color is changed, and the objective is to change all blocks colors. Some glowing blocks have special effects when hit like sticking the ball to the paddle, giving an extra ball or shrinking the paddle. A time limit is given to each leval, and if the player doesn&apos;t succeed, another chance is given. The game is over when all balls are lost though the holes in the frame.    5. Front Line: in this game the player has to shoot tanks, trucks, planes and helicopters before they shoot back. There are two weapons available: a cannon with unlimited ammo and 10 missiles per stage.    6. Rockman&apos;s Zone: in this game the player has to shoot cardboard pictures of bandits while avoiding shooting pictures of women, children and policemen. Bonus points are given for acurracy.    In the shooting games the player can choose to have the Accu-Sight on or off. If it is on, a crosshair will be displayed. If it&apos;s off, the player can also choose to use the Menacer&apos;s Binocular Module.</story>

  <story>Mercs is a shoot &apos;em up influenced by Ikari Warriors. You are an anti-terrorism soldier, and must rescue a former President from a Central African revolutionary gang.     You run through each of the 8 levels, which primarily scroll horizontally, shooting everyone before they can shoot you. At times you will have to shoot trees and other scenery to progress.     Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can&apos;t shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</story>

  <story>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.    Mickey&apos;s Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They&apos;ll find five characters from the Disney&apos;s universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.    Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle&apos;s paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they&apos;ll receive a gift.    After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy&apos;s task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.    Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</story>

  <story>If you&apos;re bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.    These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.    Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.    The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</story>

  <story>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung&apos;s mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.    Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a &quot;Fatality&quot; on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.    Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game&apos;s fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

  <story>Shao Kahn has won. The Earthrealm is no more. In order to revive his Queen Sindel, the emperor Shao Kahn used the Outworld Tournament from Mortal Kombat 2 as a diversion while his Shadow Priests revive his fallen Queen on Earth. Once enacted, the dimensional bridge between the two realms connects, allowing Kahn&apos;s extermination squads to invade and destroy Earth, and enslave the population&apos;s souls.    A small team of Raiden&apos;s &quot;Chosen Warriors&quot; survives the attack: Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.    Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level playfields, &quot;Dial-A-Combo&quot; attacks, a &quot;Run&quot; button to speed up the battles, and &quot;Vs.&quot; codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.    Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the series to feature motion-captured digitized graphics for its kombatants, and introduces online network play to the PC version.</story>

This sequel continued on the &quot;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&quot; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.    Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.    Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.    Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &quot;Junior&quot;.</story>

  <story>Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring the three-time World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called &quot;FreeCam&quot; 3D system), with the boxers moving around the ring in 360��.    One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O. and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes: exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself.    There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides which of the boxer&apos;s arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode, the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an uppercut.    Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain power or speed. There&apos;s also a counter of punches landed at each side of the screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during the fight.    The game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali&apos;s voice.</story>

  <story>Futuristic, intergalactic war disguised as American Football, Mutant League Football was one of the most unique football games ever to hit the gaming market. It&apos;s a unique blend of sports and sci-fi, and the actual football is the good ol&apos; smash-mouth kind, literally.    Dynamite throwing running backs, blitzing trolls, robots that bleed oil, it&apos;s all here. Opposing quarterback connecting on too many passes? Blitz him &apos;til he&apos;s dead. Suspect the ref&apos;s been bribed by the other side? Call a Kill Ref audible; it&apos;s a 5 yard penalty though.     Take your pick from nineteen teams, including three All-Star teams. There are five difficulty levels and a slow/fast game speed toggle. A tournament mode awaits those who want something more than a quick game versus the computer or a friend.    There are nineteen different fields to play on, all with there own special quirks. The Hellfield is littered with mines and fire pits to put an end to a careless runner, while The Pen is a slippery sheet of ice.</story>

  <story>Mutant League Hockey is a violent hockey game in the same series as Mutant League Football.  There are 23 bizarre hockey teams to choose from, with players consisting of zombies, skeletons, trolls, and robots.  The arenas are equally strange, with hidden bottomless pits, mines placed under the ice, spikes, and a &quot;Demon Net&quot; that functions as a goalie by chomping up and down and devouring the puck.  The game plays similar to normal hockey, except in this game your players can pick up chainsaws, maces, axes, etc. to use against the competition.  It&apos;s a bloody game, with opponents exploding into piles of goo (or circuits if they are a robot) when they become too injured.  The player can call special plays, like an exploding puck or jail break and attack the goalie.  The game also has fighting sequences if two players decide to get into a brawl.    The game comes with multiplayer and a playoff series, full stats for your players and instant replays.</story>

  <story>This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.    Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.    The Tournament Edition ups each team&apos;s roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player&apos;s stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:    1. &amp;quot;Hot Spots&amp;quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.    Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up. Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.    &amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.    &amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</story>

  <story>In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:    1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.    2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.    3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family&apos;s debt.    4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.    5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...    6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.    Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It&apos;s up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships.    During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player&apos;s flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.</story>

  <story>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell.     The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.  A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.    Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.</story>

  <story>After establishing themselves in the virtual rinks, EA combined both NHL and NHLPA licenses in NHL &apos;94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in the series.    Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or &quot;regular season&quot; in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no offsides).     While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the PC version released at the same time features complete season action.</story>

Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures. The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.

  <story>In the 16th century, Japan&apos;s Sengoku (&quot;Warring States&quot;) period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.     Nobunaga&apos;s Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei&apos;s better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.    During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp;amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender&apos;s region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</story>

  <story>The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.    Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It&apos;s possible to watch the other semi-final.  Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.    The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it&apos;s own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).</story>

  <story>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.    Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times.     Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.    The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.    Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the &quot;gold&quot; points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</story>

  <story>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It&apos;s an ordinary evening, and Bruno&apos;s dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno&apos;s vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father&apos;s pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it&apos;s up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids&apos; eyes - and rescue his dad!    The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno&apos;s primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno&apos;s special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.     Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno&apos;s score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</story>

  <story>You play Lester, a young physics professor, who suddenly finds himself in a strange alien world after a lightning struck during his particle experiment. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens, who together with him escapes from the prison, helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.    Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is concealed behind what looks like a typical platform shooter. The gameplay is based mainly on physical and environmental puzzles. There is no on-screen interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a different strategy, and often there is only one way to solve the problem. Typically, enemies will be defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the gun can be used to create a shield from behind which you can safely fire.     The game is divided into levels, each one of which can be accessed by typing a code you learn after having completed the level. If you die (which is often) you restart the level anew. The game features vector graphics and animated cut scenes.</story>

  <story>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members&apos; attacks and to avoid running out of gas.    The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.    Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you&apos;ll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.</story>

As mentioned you get to select from 8 differently tuned cars, each with different handling and speed specs. and then ride out in hopes of getting the trophy. At the end of each stage you get to select between different branching routes that determine what your next stage will be, and thus the different routes you take to the end game determine what ending you get (if you manage to beat the other players).

  <story>Based on Namco&apos;s Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.    The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man&apos;s directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a &quot;wall&quot; on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.    Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It&apos;s similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.    The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man&apos;s direction with the press of a button.    All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</story>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</story>

Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).    The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.    Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It&apos;s possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</story>

  <story>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing.     Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy &apos;links&apos; course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.    When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</story>

  <story>The sequel to PGA Tour, this game was released solely for the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive along with an alternative version for the Game Gear, as was getting more common for EA sports titles at the time, helping to drive the sales of the 2nd choice console.    This update sees the series add ten professional players to the roster (60 in total) and have the ability to play against them on seven courses and across five tournaments. There is also a new graphics engine in place and new sounds to boot. Statistics became more detailed and the ball physics were improved through a Draw and Fade meter. Game data can be backed up through the built-in battery. Other features include different ball lies, dynamic wind conditions, digitized sounds, an improved automatic caddy and special shots such as chips, punches and fringe putts.</story>

  <story>The team at Polygames make some small improvements to the latest PGA title. It has a US setting in terms of the courses and players, unlike PGA European Tour, with 8 courses in total. Control is via the standard method of setting the shot up, then pressing the button once to start a swing, a second time to set the pace, and a third time to set draw/fade. Before taking a shot the club choice, direction and intended draw/fade  (spin on the ball) are selected. You can play a 72-hole tournament against 60 other PGA pros, or practice the holes at your leisure.</story>

  <story>The people on a technically advanced planet Mota make experiments to create biomechanical creatures. But one day, a creature was created that appeared to be dangerous to the humans themselves. No signal came to the capital city from the experimental labs... You, a nameless young man living in Paleo, Mota&apos;s capital, are commanded to go to the labs and check the issue. Your friend Nei, a semi-human girl, goes with you, and other brave adventurers join you on what starts with a simple mission but develops into saving the entire world...    This is the first Phantasy Star game for the Genesis, set in a futuristic world. The turn-based combat allows you to choose between &quot;fight&quot;, where the characters simply attack physically for one turn, and &quot;strategy&quot;, where you can choose from several sub-commands, to defend, to use a special technique, or to run from the battle. Instead of magic there are &quot;techniques&quot;, that require the usage of TP (technique points).</story>

  <story>The Algo star system is in troubled times...    Many thousands of years ago, the Algo Star System was a peaceful system. Three planets surrounded the peaceful Algo star and were in perfect harmony: Palma, a lush green planet, where its citizens devoted their lives to arts and the sciences. Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians, and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died. Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...    Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter&apos;s Guild on Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine assignment...    The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the &quot;techniques&quot; (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before, leveling up and technique-learning is automatic. There are a few segments in the game with vehicle combat, which mostly follows the same turn-based formula as the regular battles. Side quests are present in form of hunter assignments for Chaz and his friends.</story>

However, holding the fire button down for a few seconds will charge the sword; and upon releasing it, it shoots a larger fireball that does a fair amount of damage. During the game, you collect items that increases your speed and give you more firepower.    At the end of each chapter, you have to destroy a boss in order to proceed to the next one. Between each chapter, you can watch an intermission that details what is happening at the temple.</story>

  <story>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.    Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.    When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy&apos;s people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won&apos;t stop until they&apos;re all dead... or he is.    But you don&apos;t have to let your people have all the fun; the god&apos;s have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn&apos;t build on high-ground.     And when you win, you&apos;ll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god&apos;s play is just never done.</story>

  <story>Players guide Lt. Mike Harrigan as he tracks the Predator through seven levels based on the film. Mike&apos;s primary concerns are the hostages held around the levels, and the legions of gang members out for blood. He also has to contend with the Predator, both as a boss at the end of each level, and as a time limit - if the player takes too long to rescue a hostage, the Predator will blast the hostage with his tri-laser.    The game is played in a third-person isometric view, with great swarms of easily-killed bad guys, who appear through one-way doors scattered throughout the level. Weapons not only include faster machine guns and shotguns, but also a few highly-advanced Predator weapons the player can pick up and use. Each defeated gang member drops drugs that can be picked up and automatically sent off to the &quot;drug squad&quot; for points. No sounds or music from the film get used, but stills scenes from the film do introduce the levels.</story>

  <story>The first game in Gremlin&apos;s series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.    The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition&apos;s strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).    The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don&apos;t need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.    The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.</story>

  <story>Premier Manager 97 is the second Mega Drive game in the hit football managing game series of the early nineties. Similar to the first run of games in the series (released between 1992 and 1994), the manager starts (in the Full Game mode) as a lowly division 3 (not Conference) manager, where the goal is to get the club to the top divisions, or get signed to better placed teams. In the Demo mode, the player can choose any Premier League team, but only for a season.    In either of the modes, the player is responsible for carefully assembling the team (and unlike other managers, selecting the appropriate tactics is crucial to win the game), get the best from the transfer market by selling the fading stars and outselling the biggest clubs in England in the quest for the stars of the future, improve stadium capacity and quality (including seating, roof, security and others), sign good deals for ground advertising and balance the budget to make the team finish the season out of the red.    Matches are always simulated, with a ruler showing where the ball is, and with text messages showing actions (like &quot;player passes&quot;, player tackles&quot; and so on). The chances of goals are shown in LED-style animated clips.</story>

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar&apos;s guards, find your way through the Sultan&apos;s palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you&apos;ve got 60 minutes!    Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.    The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</story>

The games options allow the player to choose to play on 6 different field surfaces (grass, mud, dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf) and to choose how long the game will last (2, 5, 10 or 15 minute quarters). There are also no penalties in this game whatsoever.     Gameplay consists of playing on both offense and defense. There are 26 different offensive plays and 18 different defensive plays to choose from. The game has a down the field view when on offense, so the game doesn&apos;t have receivers in windows.</story>

  <story>In the year 2090, Earth is invaded by extra-terrestrials. The World Alliance of Nations has developed a supersonic attack fighter, Raiden, to defend the Earth. A pilot must take control of the experimental fighter to destroy the alien warships that just happen to look like odd variations of typical military tanks and planes with gadgets attached to them.     Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</story>

  <story>Based on the film of the same name, this game puts you in John Rambo&apos;s shoes as he travels to Afghanistan to free Colonel Trautman from the Soviets.    In six missions, Rambo must complete various objectives. Besides finding the exit of the level, prisoners must be freed and enemy ammunition supplies destroyed. Rambo is controlled from an overhead perspective and has several weapons at his disposal. Besides a machine gun that never runs out of ammo, he can use a knife for close range kills, set off timed bombs and use his famous crossbow with explosive arrows. Ammunition for the bow and the bombs is limited and can be collected from dead enemies.    After some of the missions, the perspective switches to a view behind Rambo and additional boss fights take place. Soviet tanks or helicopters must be destroyed using the crossbow. While aiming the bow, Rambo cannot move, but otherwise he can hide behind rocks or other obstacles from enemy fire.</story>

  <story>Ranger X was released fairly late in the lifetime of the megadrive. Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of.    The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons. The mech can also use it&apos;s rocket pack to boost off of the ground and hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of platform game and shoot-em-up.    The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.</story>

  <story>Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator.  Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.    The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea.  Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series.  Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.    Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, there are numerous mission-oriented sequences in which the occupants of the helicopter disembark and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings.  Each of the three characters have a unique set of weapons, and the player can choose from either of the three to use, so long as none of them have been killed during previous on-foot missions.    Red Zone bears many gameplay similarities to the early entries of the Strike series of games, though while the first three games of that series had a fixed isometric point-of-view, Red Zone has a straight-down POV that rotates along with the helicopter.  Red Zone is also highly reminiscent of Zyrinx&apos;s earlier and similarly technologically advanced Genesis game Sub-Terrania, with the most notable similarities being in the relative difficulty of the games, and in the manipulation of the Genesis&apos; hardware into providing visual effects not seen in other games, such as simulated video.</story>

  <story>For a long time, our world was in darkness. The sun shone as always, but our souls were dark and lacked the true enlightenment. Then the holy Nexus arrived, and changed everything. With his Rod of Creation, he blessed the people with the gift of the six Arts. The Red Priests - the people he chose among the others - established an order of the six Guilds. The world entered the era of prosperity. But the evil demon Void stole the Rod of Creation and drove the world to chaos again. In a cosmic battle, Nexus faced Void. None was victorious, and the Rod of Power was broken during the battle. It was divided into eleven rings, known as the Rings of Power. The young sorcerer Buc is now sent on a quest to retrieve those rings, and to unite the Rod of Power that will eventually banish Void forever!    &quot;Rings of Power&quot; is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise, and is more similar to Western-style games such as  Ultima series. You can freely wander through the huge isometric world, and are not obliged to follow any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on magic spells. On your journey you will encounter characters from several guilds, each proficient in his own type of magic, and make them join your party.</story>

  <story>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.    By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.    Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</story>

  <story>Following the previous two Road Rash games, the player has conquered the US illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?    Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, Road Rash 3 adds all new digitized sprites (based on the 32-bit remake released an year earlier), bike upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more active and a longer race.    As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for Sega&apos;s 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars, which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.    Each track has it&apos;s own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during the night under the neon lights.</story>

  <story>The Dark Horse comic book crossover of the two famous 80s cyborgs spawned various different game adaptations. RoboCop versus The Terminator on the Genesis is only loosely based on the comic.    The player controls RoboCop who during his duty of policing the streets of Detroit is lured into a trap by Terminators sent from the future. By uploading himself into the computer network, he becomes the seed from which the malevolent Skynet grows. Years later, in the post-apocalyptic future, RoboCop is reactivated and must help the human resistance by attacking and defeating Skynet once and for all.    The game is a platformer with heavy shooting elements and consists of 10 levels. Many enemies stand in RoboCop&apos;s way and must be destroyed via 8 different weapons. RoboCop begins the game with only a basic pistol, but other weapons can be found, including flame and grenade throwers, laser guns, self-seeking missiles and others. While all guns have unlimited ammo, only two can be carried at the same time and being killed means the currently equipped gun is lost.    The game is evenly split between present and future levels. Enemies in present Detroit include mostly street punks and other criminal elements while the future is of course populated by deadly machines: Terminators, robotic dogs and spiders and many automated guns. Each level ends with a boss battle, featuring Terminators, heavy tanks and RoboCop&apos;s famous adversaries ED-209 and Cain (aka RoboCop 2).    Some levels feature optional goals besides getting to the exit, like freeing hostages or destroying security cameras.</story>

When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a ���ball���.  The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball.     The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.</story>

You can also get cool weapons that pack more of a punch than your ordinary hand gun.

  <story>The events in the third game in the series are synchronous with RT2. At the end of the twentieth century, satellites around the globe are being shot down, disrupting communications. Secret agency Rolling Thunder discovers the organization behind the terror: Geldra. While agents Leila and Albatross are fighting the leader Gimdo (RT2), agent Jay is instructed to bring down Dread, the second-in-command.    There are many improvements to the gameplay: Jay can shoot while jumping and shoot diagonally upwards with certain weapons. At the beginning of each mission, you can pick a special weapon such as a laser rifle, bazooka, flamethrower or grenades. You have to choose carefully as they cannot be reused in later missions. You can still hide in doorways and recharge your weapons behind special doors. The mission timer from the previous game has been replaced by a sniper that targets you with a crosshair when you don&apos;t move fast enough. The brutal difficulty from the previous games has been toned down: there are more life marks at the start and you now resurrect where you died, rather than returning to the last checkpoint. Unlike the previous game, you can only choose one character to play with.    After completing a mission, a password is provided to continue playing. There are ten levels in total, with a few hidden areas.</story>

  <story>The Europe-only sequel to Pete Sampras Tennis, Pete Sampras Tennis &apos;96 includes new features, such as a reworked graphics engine with parallax scrolling, new shots and aftertouch controls, with an Indoor court joins the previously available Grass, Clay and Hard courts.     Changes to the game go well beyond the graphics - now the ball reacts differently in each court and it&apos;s harder to control the direction of the ball, meaning the powerful forehands that could win a game in minutes of the first game are much harder to pull. Services now must be perfectly weighted in both power, direction and timing, facing the risk of hitting the net or going off bounds, with a speedometer showing how fast the best serves went. All these are controlled using the three buttons of the gamepad and the d-pad, with the A button for lobbing the ball, B to make passing shots and C to dive for a direction. By combining the B and A or C buttons it&apos;s possible to add top/back or full spin to the ball, with the  Y axis changing the power and the X axis the direction.     The large roster of Pete Sampras Tennis was replaced by only eight players: Pete Sampras himself, Sam Nimitz (German, powerful player best suited for hard courts), Marie Guyennot (French, accurate and fast around the court), Minori Hurosawa (Japanese, fast and agile all around), Dino Turnetti (Italian, with an aggressive style of play), Wanda Tucker (American, all around), Esperanza Delgado (Spanish, powerful serve and volleying abilities) and Richard Potter (English, rookie all-arounder).  There are three game modes to square things up - Challenge (single match, pairs or doubles on any court), Tournament (&quot;Party mode&quot; for up to eight players) and World Tour (single player mode, where the player squares against seven computer players, with the option to play singles or doubles. There&apos;s a Pro mode which extend the match to three sets and increase the difficulty setting by enhancing  computer player AI and allowing them to perform spin shots).</story>

  <story>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.    Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various &apos;mission areas&apos; where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.    The vehicles you have at your command include    1. Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right  2. Stinger: A prototype &quot;next generation&quot; attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.  3. Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill  4. Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it&apos;s orientation between left and right. It&apos;s weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport  5. Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It&apos;s main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches  6. Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</story>

  <story>Counting Cafe is an educational game based on the popular children&apos;s show Sesame Street. The player controls Grover, working as a waiter at a restaurant, where Mr. Johnson appears and orders various items. The player must take Grover into the kitchen, collect the items ordered, and return to Mr. Johnson&apos;s table, where he will reward the player with a star if the order is correct. If the player picks up the wrong items, they can be taken to Cookie Monster at the back of the restaurant, who will eat them and clear Grover&apos;s tray.    There are five sections to each &quot;day&quot; -- Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, and Dessert. Once the player has completed Dessert, a monkey will run by and snatch the last star. Grover then must chase after the monkey to retrieve his last star, after which the game will move on to the next day.    After the first day, Sesame Street denizens will start appearing in the kitchen playing around with food items. Sometimes their activities with a food item will end up landing on Grover&apos;s tray, which may result in Grover carrying an unwanted food item, forcing him to give the food to Cookie Monster and having to collect the correct food items all over again.</story>

Each character fires their own type of weapon and each character can charge up their weapon to make it a more powerful shot. All the characters also have a special weapon that can clear all the enemies on the screen but with the caveat that it can only be used once per stage. Each character also has a jump and speed attribute which when powered up allows them to jump higher and walk faster. Players can switch between all of the characters during a stage.

But a new threat arose, in a reptilian form that lived on vicious instinct alone. The colossal monster moved slowly and quietly, and its attack was relentless. The souls unfortunate enough to survive became hostages, and mass panic swept the streets.    It remained only for Shinobi to take action. His weapons were stealth and quickness of attack, his only allies facing overwhelming forces. Relying on Ninja weapons and magic, Shinobi fought on, assisted by his faithful dog.    Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is similar to Shadow Dancer for home computers, and consists of five missions containing three stages each. However, there are a few differences between the two. For example, in this Sega Genesis/Mega Drive exclusive, the stages are different, and you rescue hostages rather than disarm bombs.  Each mission ends up with you fighting a boss, and when you defeat each (except the final one), you also participate in a bonus stage where you must shoot all ninja flying towards you.    Some of the enemies are also quite different. Some of the lizards, which appear in later missions,  leave a &quot;lizard coin&quot;, which you can collect for bonus lives.</story>

  <story>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man&apos;s body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.  As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.    Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the &quot;very challenging&quot; and the &quot;impossible&quot;. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</story>

  <story>Shining Force II is a strategy/RPG hybrid with cartoon-like graphics. The game is comprised of two modes: exploration, in which the hero and his companions engage in the role-playing game standard of talking to townspeople, exploring new lands, and furthering the plot; and battle mode, in which the combat is resolved from a tactical point of view, with individual combats being resolved from a close-up view with animated characters.    The plot consists of such quests as saving a princess from the clutches of demons, rebuilding the hero&apos;s hometown, and uniting the various forces of good together against the hero&apos;s nemesis. Along the way, the hero will be joined by many characters who seek to aid him in his journey. Several of these characters can only be obtained by completing side quests. In addition, random battles can occur between the programmed scenarios, giving the hero&apos;s party a chance to obtain experience and gain levels outside of the set scenarios.    There are several difficulty levels in the game, selectable when starting a new game. In addition, there is a configuration code that allows cheats to be activated, including the ability to control the enemy units.</story>

The Kingdom of Thornwood has been invaded by Dark Sol&apos;s men, and it is your job to vanquish them. You will need the Arms of Light to do this.    The game is a first person RPG, with turn-based combat and cartoony graphics. The dialogue is displayed via dialog bubbles appearing above the characters speaking, although the protagonist never speaks. There are no sub-quests - the secrets in the game involve  the location and use of special metal for forging esoteric items. There are about 25 to 30 hours of gameplay to be found here, before the final battle and ending sequence.</story>

  <story>Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle game based on the original gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.    The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round, Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of the number of steps taken.    The game supports passwords and includes an edit mode where new levels can be designed and played.</story>

  <story>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield.    On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough &quot;proof&quot; of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won&apos;t be easy since the Space Mutants are &quot;using&quot; human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.    The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.    Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</story>

  <story>Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurfs&apos; laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows them to travel to anywhere in the world, but suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home.    A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them), so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario (ropes, or vines). While large falls don&apos;t harm the Smurfs, improper contact with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages there&apos;s a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills the meter, a 1-up is awarded.</story>

  <story>It&apos;s a race to the moon for the two snakes, Rattle and Roll!  Play alone or simultaneously with a friend as you out-score and out-eat your opponent - then weigh yourself on the scales and make for the exit!    Snake, Rattle &apos;n Roll is an isometric 3D platformer.  The object of each level is to eat as many Nibbley Pibblies (round creatures of various colours) as possible to make your snake heavy.  Once it&apos;s heavy enough, you must stand on the scales in the level, and if you&apos;re heavy enough, the door will open and you can make your way to the exit.    As with many platform games of its era, Snake, Rattle &apos;n Roll is incredibly difficult.  Foes include Jaws, a monster that&apos;s all teeth and will kill you if you stay in the water too long, and Bigfoots, which stomp all over the place and require multiple tongue lashings to defeat.  Then there&apos;s the many types of Nibblies, such as Pibblesplats, which hop around and splat into puddles, Pibbleboings, which are spring-loaded and jump incredibly high, and Pibblewings, which fly high out of reach.    Two-player mode provides both a co-op and competitive experience: while you are both trying to eat more Nibblies than your opponent, if you both stand on the level&apos;s scale at the same time, both of your weights will be counted and it will be possible for you to exit the level more quickly.</story>

  <story>A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.    Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.    There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone, which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then moves on to the next High Speed Zone.    The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being recorded.</story>

  <story>Sonic and Knuckles continues the story directly from where Sonic the Hedgehog 3 left off.  The explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying deep into Floating Island&apos;s Mushroom Hills.  Sonic knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power.  Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can Sonic stop Robotnik&apos;s plans and find the Master Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles?  Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island when he&apos;s attacked by one of Robotnik&apos;s robots!  He quickly begins a chase for revenge.    Sonic &amp; Knuckles is the fourth game in the Sonic series.  It retains the same basic features as in the previous Sonic games (speed, rings for protection, Special Stages with Chaos Emeralds) as well as the three different shield types introduced in Sonic 3 (Fire, Water and Electric).  Players can select either of the two title characters for play - either Sonic, or the all-new Knuckles the Echidna.  Knuckles cannot jump as high as Sonic, but he can glide by holding the jump button while in the air.  If you glide into a wall, Knuckles will also be able to climb it.  He can also break through walls that Sonic can&apos;t.  With these abilities, Knuckles can access different areas from Sonic, making for each level an entirely new experience.    Unlike Sonic 3, Sonic &amp; Knuckles features three bonus stages - two are available by jumping into the lamppost checkpoint stars (as in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  These stages give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  The first is a Casino-themed level where you can jump into a slot machine and earn (or lose!) rings.  The second is a more skill-based level where you must time your jumps off orbs to launch higher and collect bonuses.  If you hit the barrier at the bottom of the stage, it ends.  The other type of bonus stage is the &quot;Special Stage&quot; seen in Sonic 3, which, as previously, can be accessed by jumping into giant rings hidden within the levels themselves.  If the player collects all the blue spheres in these stages (while avoiding all the red ones) they will earn a Chaos Emerald.    A unique feature of the Sonic &amp; Knuckles cart is the ability to &quot;Lock-On&quot; previous Sonic games into a cartridge slot at the top.  Adding Sonic 3 will combine both Sonic 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles into one long game, as well as adding the ability to save, and use Tails in the Sonic &amp; Knuckles levels.  Plugging in Sonic 2 lets players use Knuckles in Sonic 2, as well allowing the use of his glide and wall climb abilities.  Finally, plugging in the original Sonic the Hedgehog cart lets the player access unlimited level variations of the Blue Sphere bonus stage.  Subsequent re-releases of Sonic &amp; Knuckles have also included most of these bonus features.</story>

  <story>While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that can travel between parallel worlds, were captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik.    Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and right.     Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens.   Unlike all other previous games, time isn&apos;t a requirement: if the player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.</story>

  <story>Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega&apos;s premier rodent, Sonic. It&apos;s a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease.     The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic&apos;s animal friends, and trapped them inside  robots.  Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels.     Sonic&apos;s weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he&apos;s carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks.     The game is divided into several &quot;zones&quot;, each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight.     Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it&apos;s first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with &quot;attitude.&quot;</story>

  <story>The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms all animals into robots called &apos;Badniks&apos;. This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg.  Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles &apos;Tails&apos; Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world.     Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.  Like the original, players run through different worlds called &quot;Zones&quot;, which each have their own specific theme.  There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone&apos;s last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress.    Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels.  As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life.  However, the rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible.  If he is hit again when he has no rings, he&apos;ll lose a life.    If the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they&apos;ll be able to access the Special Stage.  In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint.  Complete all the checkpoints and you&apos;ll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.    New to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play.  Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a &quot;Spin Dash&quot;.  This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum.    The game also features a 2-player versus mode.  This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game.</story>

  <story>Dr. Robotnik&apos;s Death Egg has crash-landed on Floating Island, so called because it harnesses the power of the Chaos Emeralds to float in the air.  Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?    Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games.  As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed.  The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt.  Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.    New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you).  Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump.  If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air.  Tails cannot use the shields&apos; special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time.  He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.    There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine.  By hitting the crank, you&apos;ll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields.  The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.    The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level.  In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early).  Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue.  Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.    Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts.  At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic&apos;s animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots.  The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.    As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style.  There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear.  You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.</story>

This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip.    There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.    The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.</story>

  <story>Sparkster is the sequel to Rocket Knight Adventures and is completely different from the contemporary SNES title Sparkster. It takes place immediately after the events of the first game. The interactive introduction scene shows Sparkster picking up a new sword after the final fight when his nemesis Axel Gear appears, the rocket knight gone evil. After a fight in giant robots, Sparkster manages to save Princess Cherry and returns her to the queen. Then suddenly Axel appears again and he kidnaps her. It turns out Axel is working once more for the Empire of Gedol. Sparkster has to return the peace in Kingdom of Zebulos, save the princess and bring an end to the evil empire.    The game consists of six levels with 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay. The opossum Sparkster can move around, jump and attack with his sword. Using his rocket pack, he can also perform stronger attacks and burst through the air in different directions. The rocket power consists of a double meter that refills gradually, making it possible to perform successive attacks in the air, ricocheting off walls. The first meter allows for the strongest attacks, but fills more slowly. Sparkster collects diamonds, apples to restore health and different types of power-ups for his sword. Most levels have typical platform gameplay, but there is also a level where Sparkster walks around in a giant robot, knocking enemies out of the air.    For an additional challenge players can locate the seven swords hidden throughout the levels. When all of them have been found, the hero turns into Golden Sparkster. The game includes a password system.</story>

  <story>Brutal Deluxe doesn&apos;t live up to their name - in fact they&apos;re the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 &apos;legs&apos; with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.    You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.    The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are &apos;portals&apos; which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.    You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.    A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team&apos;s power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</story>

Spidey has 24 hours to find and disarm that bomb. And he must also clear his name, so he takes his camera to take convincing photos for his Spider-Man hating boss, J. Jonah Jameson, and the police, to prove his innocence. Along the way, he just may run into a few of his *AHEM* &quot;old friends&quot;, including Dr. Octopus, Electro, Mysterio, and ultimately Kingpin himself!</story>

Having been unable to save Jennifer, you keep having the recurring dream where she is begging you to come and rescue her. The mask from the Splatterhouse appears and promises that there is still a chance to save her. There is a downside to it, though. Wearing the mask of terror will fill you with feral rage and an insatiable hunger for blood.    Heavily influenced by films such as Evil Dead 2, the game takes you through eight, side-scrolling stages. Rick has a basic set of punches, kicks and flying kicks, but he can pick up additional weapons such as a lead pipes, bones, bombs, a shotgun and a chainsaw for the ultimate bloodfest, while fighting skulls, razor fish and giant demons. A boss, requiring a specific pattern of moves, awaits you at the end of each stage.</story>

  <story>It has been a while since the escape in Splatterhouse 2 and Rick is slowly regaining his sanity. At night, he is still haunted by nightmares from the place. Rick has married Jennifer and they have a son, David. In the final chapter of this horror trilogy, Rick finds out that an entity called The Evil One has kidnapped his beloved family members. He has no choice but to wear the demon mask with the supernatural powers to save Jennifer and David from the demon-infested Splatterhouse.    The third title in the series builds upon the gameplay of its predecessors. The game consists of six consecutive levels in a huge mansion. In a race against time, you have to wipe the demons from each room and find the quickest path to the boss area. After clearing a room, you can use an in-game map to decide upon the quickest route. Improvements over the second title include moving between rooms in multiple directions, multiple endings based on your performance, special moves for Rick and crisper graphics.    It still has a horror theme and maintains the same level of gore and violence. You can collect weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an ax and cement blocks. If you get knocked down, a ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop it in another room of the house. Other collectible items include extra lives, health meat or orbs. These orbs build up a power meter. Upon completion, you have the ability to transform into a berserk mutant for a short time. The cutscenes feature real actors who act out the characters.</story>

  <story>The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.    Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge, controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.    From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: with other ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which is only possible if your current mission requires it).    Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members, Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.    Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields and trying to dodge you enemy&apos;s torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.    While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version as well.</story>

But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It&apos;s time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?    Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it&apos;s up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.</story>

The last free nation, the Republic of Silverhead, tries to bring the Motorhead Empire down using its newly developed weapon, the lightning bomb.    Apart from its unusual Steampunk setting, Steel Empire is a fairly traditional side-scrolling shooter. At the beginning of every level, the player gets to choose between a striker plane and a zeppelin. While the plane is faster, the zeppelin has a longer life bar and can therefore sustain more damage. Both ships use the same standard weapon, which can be fired forwards or backwards, as well as bombs that are released automatically while firing. Also available is a limited number of lightning bombs that damage or destroy all enemies on screen.     Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience points.    Options are small &quot;drones&quot; that fly alongside the player&apos;s ship and mimic its behaviour.    Experience points can be collected to level up the ships&apos; weapons (up to level 20) and thereby increase their fire power.</story>

  <story>Streets of Rage, Sega&apos;s answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a &quot;Mr. X&quot; where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves.    Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.  Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature &quot;death drops&quot; where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</story>

  <story>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam&apos;s brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel&apos;s good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...    Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</story>

  <story>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat &apos;em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn&apos;t full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</story>

He is Hiryu, Super A-Class Strider. His mission is to defeat the Grand Master and put an end to his plotting once and for all.    Converted from the classic arcade game, Strider lets you run, jump, perform acrobatics and climb walls and overhangs.

  <story>Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.    The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.</story>

  <story>The first game in the long-running soccer series, which stood out from the crowd with a unique forced perspective 3D view rather than a simple overhead one. The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. However, the standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.</story>

  <story>The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer edition includes 8 events from athletics to cycling. The events are:    1. Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added  2. Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a button fires the arrow.  3. 400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely off-balance and falls, ending the event  4. High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed. Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared.  5. Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.  6. Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is released as well  7. Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge without falling.    Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or compete in a tournament (up to eight human players, with three computer levels and 16 nations to choose from). It&apos;s also possible to replay and even store your best (or worst) moments.</story>

  <story>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.    However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player&apos;s ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.    In 2020 Super Baseball is a fast-paced game with new rules, where you can select 1 of 12 individual men, women, or robot players. During play, you can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.</story>

  <story>This game features two different modes of play: Classic Battleship and Super Battleship.    Classic Battleship is the typical Battleship game where the players set up their ships on a grid, then take turns choosing 3 places at a time to target and hope they hit the opposing players ship. The game ends when all the opposing players ships are sunk. This mode contains four difficulty levels: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, and Admiral.    Super Battleship involves eight levels consisting of sixteen missions total. Missions include sinking enemy ships in a certain number of rounds, escorting ships to their destinations, defending cities from attack, and destroying enemy airfields. Gameplay consists of a turn-based moving of ships utilizing an overhead view. The player can then target any enemy units within the ship&apos;s range and attack. Attacking brings up an action sequence where both ships trade volleys of gunfire until one of them either sinks or retreats.</story>

  <story>This is a conversion of Sega&apos;s popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.      This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.</story>

The next morning, strange doors began to appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, but were never seen again. From that day on, unusual events and disasters began to take place. Huge cracks opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands, floods wiped out entire villages. And then the monsters came. The Hydlide council feared that the same evil in the legends was back again. A wise old oracle predicted the second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young man who could save Hydlide from the grave danger. This young man is you...    Super Hydlide continues the tradition of action RPGs started with the original Hydlide for NES. You can choose to play as one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, you use melee or long-ranged weapons or cast magic spells in real time. There is an internal clock in the game that makes it necessary for you to sleep periodically to regain your strength. You also have to eat from time to time, otherwise your hit points will gradually decrease.</story>

  <story>A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga.    A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering.     24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you&apos;re much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there&apos;s no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.    The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.</story>

  <story>This follow-up to Thunder Blade is very similar to the original arcade game. Get into your helicopter and blast away at the numerous enemies with your cannon and missiles. The four stages all follow a similar pattern: the first part is from a perspective behind your helicopter where you not only have to dodge enemy fire but also obstacles like buildings or caves. In between, face off against one or two smaller boss enemies. When the first part of a level is finished, the view switches to an overhead perspective for the confrontation with the level end boss.</story>

  <story>Super Volleyball is an indoor volleyball game for one or two players. The single player mode offers two game options: normal game and World League. Choosing normal game pits the player against the computer in a single game. Choosing World League pits the player against all other teams available. A password save is available in this mode.    The game features eight national teams (USA, USSR, Brazil, Holland, France, Italy, Japan and China), with fictitiously named players. Players can be changed during gameplay by pressing C. There is also an option to create new teams, choosing the team&apos;s name, color, player&apos;s position and names.    Gameplay is viewed from a side scrolling perspective, with the camera fixed on the ball. A small radar on the top of the screen shows the players&apos; positions of both teams. Players can, bump, set, spike, dump, block and dig. A collection of serves is also available: underhand, overhand and jump serve. There are also options for three ball speeds, beginning points (from 0 to 10, out of 15) and handicap.</story>

  <story>Superman is a single player, action based platformer for the Sega Genesis.

After the initial levels, the evil Brainiac kidnaps Lois Lane and takes her to his space station. Some levels take place in flight, and allow you to not only fly but shoot lasers from Superman&apos;s eyes. On the ground, you can collect icons that allow you to use a super power once, often a super punch or spin attack to remove an obstacle in the game.</story>

  <story>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).  You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.    The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.    You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</story>

  <story>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.     Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.    T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.    Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</story>

  <story>The game features the original 4 turtles from the previous games in the series, as well as other fighters.    The game is very much in the tradition of the Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter series, pitting you against opponents one at a time. Some fighters (besides the turtles) will be familiar, such as the Rat King, or even Shredder (now called &quot;Cyber-Shredder&quot; here).    Though even people familiar with the turtles will see differences in them. They can now, for example, do moves involving projectiles, such as &quot;fireballs&quot;.    The game&apos;s modes include a story mode, where you can only pick one of the turtles and go on fighting opponents in order to rescue April and Splinter, and a tournament mode, where you fight only for the fame and money.</story>

  <story>The Terminator licensed game for the Sega consoles was a fairly standard side-scrolling platform game. However, the game&apos;s six levels mirror the story-line of The Terminator movie very closely as you take on the role of Kyle Reese and his quest to save Sarah Connor from termination.    Because the game follows the movie so closely, the first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet computer and escaping through time is one of the hardest and something that most players remember with love/hate.</story>

  <story>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park&apos;s allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.    Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.    You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don&apos;t let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.    It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</story>

  <story>Thunder Force II is both a side scrolling and top down shooter. In the game you control a ship. In some stages the action is side scrolling and in others it is top down (overhead). The weapons systems is fairly basic. You can switch from shooting a more powerful weapon straight ahead or two less powerful guns shooting forward and backward simultaneously. There are various power-ups that improve your fire power.     In the top down levels you can only travel in cardinal directions and cannot maneuver around obstacles easily or slow down. The control in the side scrolling levels is reminiscent of R-Type or Gradius, but with more basic weapons systems. In future incarnations of the series the top down aspect would be abandoned.</story>

  <story>Get ready to put your blue skin-tight tights on. Ninjas need beating-up, bosses need clobbering! This game is not so much a platform game as it is a fighting game (think Streets of Rage). You run around the levels avoiding sharp flying objects and fighting any enemies that get in your way, including the numerous bosses. If your in a tight spot you can  call Arthur to help defeat any enemies that are on-screen. The game is presented in a normal 2D platformer view when you&apos;re just jumping from building to building, but changes to a semi-isometric view when you start fighting.

  <story>Time Killers is a one-on-one versus beat-em-up with gameplay in a similar vein as Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2.     What is primarily different is that you can attack with all body parts - the head, both arms and both legs. A damage system allows arms to be hacked off, but fighters can keep going with only legs and the head. A special feature allows the characters to perform a decapitation manoeuver called a &apos;death move&apos; (similar to Barbarian), at any time during a round, instantly killing an opponent, and subsequently ending the round. The game features cartoon-like over-the-top blood and gore violence.    There are eight selectable characters, and each one has unique weapons and attributes pertaining to the period in time they are from, e.g. Thugg is a caveman with a stone axe from 20,000 BC, Musashi is a samurai from Feudal Japan 1496, Orion is an intergalactic bounty hunter with an electro-sword from 2885 etc.    In the single player game, if you manage to defeat all standard opponents, you can face off against Death himself.</story>

Buster can also pick up carrots - for every fifty he collects, he gets a helper friend which can be used to destroy all enemies on the screen.  Although Buster only starts the game with three hearts, his health meter can be increased by collecting bells.    The goal of each level is to find Gogo Dodo, who will let Buster exit the level.  Similar to Super Mario World, Buster&apos;s Hidden Treasure has a world map that you can select your level from.  Also similar to Mario World, some levels contain hidden exits, creating shortcuts, or granting players access to tougher levels.</story>

Unfortunately, Earl wasn&apos;t paying enough attention to where he was driving, and ran the ship into an asteroid.  The ship crash landed onto the most bizarre planet in the galaxy: Earth.

But the various Earthlings, such as Nerd Herds, Giant Hamsters, Phantom Ice Cream Trucks and the Bogeyman will make that difficult.    The power up items that TJ and E can pick up come in the form of wrapped presents. You never really know what a power up is until you open it. What&apos;s more, randomized levels and item locations make it a different game every time.    The game features a dynamic screen splitting - screen joining 2-player mode.  Players start the game close to each other. If one gets away from the other, the screen vertically splits to allow each player to move freely. When players are close again, the screens join together to become one single screen.</story>

Batters in the game are rated according to batting average, home runs, running speed, and fielding and throwing ability. Pitchers are rated by ERA, curve-throwing ability, stamina, top throwing speed, and the distance a hit pitch will travel. All the ratings make this game a challenge to your managerial ability as well as your gaming skill because you&apos;re calling the shots from the dugout.    The option screen enables you to decide how tough your computer opponent will be. You can play a pitcher&apos;s duel, a batter&apos;s slug fest, or a normal game. Decide whether there&apos;ll be fielding errors and determine how the wind will affect the hit balls. This game covers about every detail, right down to umps who shout &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;out.&quot;</story>

  <story>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin&apos;s earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).     These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.     You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</story>

Contact can cause the car to spin, slow down or even flip; in each case you will lose time.    There are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades. As the title implies, you now have a turbo booster installed, which speeds up the car, although over-use can cause the engine to overheat, and it is not recharged until each shop section. You have 5 continues, and failure to complete the course within the time limit costs you one.</story>

  <story>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it&apos;s own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.    The gameplay can be tweaked for the players&apos; preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.    Graphically, the game is similar to EA&apos;s Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field.     The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker&apos; 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</story>

  <story>Yuko Asou is an ordinary Japanese teenager with an ordinary life - until one day she is attacked by a monster on the street. Out of nowhere, a sword appears in her hands. She fights the monsters who have suddenly invaded the city, and is summoned to the parallel world known as Vecanti, which is ruled by a cruel tyrant named Rogles, whose actions disrupt the balance of the the worlds. Wielding the legendary Valis sword, Yuko must defeat Rogles and restore the balance.    Valis has the same story and basic genre (platform action) as the  original first game in the  series; however, it is a different game with different locations, regular enemies and bosses, new cut scenes, etc.  Defeating the numerous enemies populating the game world requires precise usage of jumping and ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance the performance of Yuko&apos;s sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different strategies to defeat them.</story>

Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.</story>

Will Akira&apos;s new techniques be enough to beat Wolf? Can Lau defend his title against his daughter Pai? Will Jacky rescue his sister Sarah, who has been brainwashed to kill him? Will Jeffry make enough money to track down the Satan Shark? And Kage, will he uncover if the mysterious Judgement 6 cartel is behind the tournament? All is yet to be seen...    Sharing the name with the second title in Sega&apos;s seminal 3D fighter series, this 16-bit version brings the game to the world of 2D fighters.    While the fully polygonal environment of the arcade/saturn version were scratched in favor of regular sprites and side-scrolling camera due to obvious technological constraints (plus  manufacturing costs ruling out the SVP chip used in Virtua Racing) and featuring only the 8 original characters in the series, the rest was directly taken or inspired by it&apos;s bigger brother. The arenas are all drawn according to the to the 32-bit titles (and even feature a small parallax scrolling trick to provide a slight 3D illusion), so are the characters, and the also features a lot of the same sound effects and music. Gameplay is also inspired by the original version, with many button combinations remaining unchanged.</story>

  <story>Virtua Racing is a home port of Sega&apos;s first ever 3D, polygon-based racing game for the arcade. The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a beginner, intermediate, or expert track, competing against a second player or computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls are very &quot;arcadey&quot; and players can see the leap they made from here to Daytona.    The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is of note as it is the only game for the system which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua Processor). The chip is a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D capability) and is very similar to the SNES&apos;s SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and Stunt Race FX.</story>

  <story>Warsong is the only title of a series of famous strategy games, known as Langrisser in Japan, to ever see an official release outside of Japan. It is set in a typical medieval fantasy setting and features traditional turn-based combat. The player controls several generals who can command up to eight different units ranging from ordinary soldiers and archers to more exotic creatures like mermen or lizards.The generals fight alongside their units, however they are much more powerful and are able to use more diverse commands than just moving and attacking, like recovering a small amount of HP or casting spells. Each unit has certain strengths and weaknesses; for example soldiers are good against archers but weak against cavalry etc. Combat is also influenced heavily by terrain types. When two units engage in combat a small animation, similar to those seen in Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, is shown.</story>

The gameplay is similar to many other hockey games with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs or even a &quot;Just Play&quot; option that instantly took the player to a random game.  There is also a &quot;Simulation Mode&quot; that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an &quot;Arcade Mode&quot; that was more action oriented and with less rules.

  <story>Whip Rush is a side-scrolling (with certain vertically scrolling descents and ascents) shooter similar to Gaiares and R-Type.    You start with 3, 4 or 6 ships depending on the difficulty level you select.    In addition to moving and shooting, your ship has Power Claws that you can rotate and extend for offensive and defensive purposes. Power Claws can be equipped up to two units and can shoot bullets.    The upgradeable weapons are Laser, Missile, Fireball and Power Claw.    Laser is forward firing only but is rapid and strong, missiles can shoot back and forth and when shot from the Power Claw they will home in on enemies. Fireballs shoot in the opposite direction of your ships travel.    Unlike most other games, your ship has variable speed, which comes in handy when negotiating different kinds of obstacles and enemies.</story>

  <story>Gynoug is a horror-themed shoot&apos;em up similar to Thunder Force and other horizontal shooters. But other than most of them where you play a spaceship of some sort, here you play as Wor, a member of the so-called &apos;Flying men&apos; who look quite similar to angels.  The home planet of these people, Iccus, has been taken over by a virus that has mutated into a collection of quite horrible creatures, and every previous attempt to battle them has failed. So now it is Wor&apos;s turn to save his home planet and destroy these mutants once and for all!    Gynoug consists of 6 levels with no check points, instead you continue right where you died if you have any lifes left. Each level (except the last) has a mid-boss and a large end-boss. There are three types of shots, one that fires in a triangular fashion, one that fires more concentrated in a corridor and a bit to the back and above/below you, and one that fires to the front and back simultaneously. You can power them up in two ways, by shooting more bullets and by strengthening them. Also, feathers can increase your speed like in Gradius.</story>

Gameplay, as expected from a Winter sports game, relies on finding the faster trajectories in most events (Downhill, Giant Slalom, Luge and Bobsled), pacing the run correctly (Cross Country and Biathlon), skill and timing (Ski Jump), with button mashing reserved for just one (speed skating). The player (up to ten) can select his (or her) competitor face and nationality from one of 16 possible choices, and by selecting different difficulty settings, different computer controlled athletes take part in the competition along the player.</story>

  <story>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it&apos;s just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot &apos;em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.    In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality.     In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.    If your vitality gets low in each scene, you&apos;ll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.</story>

  <story>This soccer game lets you choose a team representing one of twenty-four countries around the world to participate in the World Championship tournament. This is identical to the real 1990 World Cup.    Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can round out the team&apos;s strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.    The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no free kicks. Whereas later sports games often carry heavy focus on the attention to detail, this game is rather simplified -- you can only control the player closest to the ball, for example, and it is missing many of the rules of soccer such as penalty flags and offsides.</story>

  <story>For the third World Cup in succession, US Gold had the license to produce the official game. They entrusted Tiertex with the task, who produced a top-down game recreating the full tournament. As well as the 24 teams who qualified for the tournament, other significant footballing nations like England, France and Denmark could be drafted in. The presentation of the menus is largely icon-based, with the official mascot featuring prominently. Tackling is difficult and passing is easy, making for a flowing end-to-end style of play.</story>

  <story>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.    Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.     There&apos;s a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.    There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</story>

The graphics are sprites, but you can move along the Z and X axes and the ring will instantly rotate 90 degrees to give a better view of the action if you are blocked in.  Your available moves are punch, kick, and grab.  You must try to wear down your opponent&apos;s life bar, then pin them.</story>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret &quot;Hit Man&quot; Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.    Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer.</story>

  <story>X-Perts was an extension of Sega&apos;s Eternal Champions Universe.     It starred one of EC&apos;s fighters (Shadow Yamamoto) in an unique action adventure game. She lead a team of elite X-Perts to do impossible missions. The game was a mixture of action, adventure and strategy.    X-Perts was set in an futuristic underwater research lab called AQUA, besieged by terrorists. The player controlled 3 characters, each with unique fighting moves and specific skill knowledge. All characters and backgrounds were pre-rendered in 3D, to give it a very high end graphic look.    The player had to react to events happening in the lab to progress the game and avoid destruction, while battling both the terrorists and the stations defenses.    This was done by direct and indirect control of the X-Perts through the entire lab (roughly 20 different levels.) The player used a special RECOM screen to monitor his characters placement across the separate areas of the lab, as well as all mission objectives, enemies, facility robots and other hazards.    Using direct control of a character, you would move around and between levels and directly combat enemies. The player could also activate tasks for mission objectives. The time it took to complete a task was based on the strength of their Engineering and or Computer Science skills.    Missions were constantly being generated and some were time dependent (missing it usually meant the situation got worse for the X-Perts), so hopping between X-Perts and assigning the ones with the best skills for the task was important. Some secondary missions allowed character upgrades to their personal weapons.    Characters could also use 3 unique torture moves each to get information from the enemies instead of killing them. This would sometimes be needed for mission objectives. However, if not executed properly, it would instantly kill the enemy instead.    The game modeled all 20 levels of the lab in real time, so even when you left a character to activate another, it would still continue to perform its task until it was attacked by enemies, and would automatically defend itself, but to a lesser extent then if you directly controlled it.    The game was broken down into chapters (save points) and each chapter remembered the status of the entire lab environment (enemies, flooded areas, broken power grids, hacked computers, active forcefields.)</story>

Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin&apos;s Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.

  <story>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.    Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.    The game (or the European PAL version) is best known for being the origin of the infamous &quot;All Your Base&quot; 2001 Internet meme.</story>

  <story>Zoom! is an arcade style puzzle game.  Your character Zoomer (a Pacman lookalike with arms &amp; legs) must trace the outline of the squares on the game board to light them up.  Points are awarded when full squares are formed, although the game also displays how many lines must still be completed. You proceed to the next level when all the squares have been lit up.  There are various monsters that will try to hunt you down - contact with these costs you energy and eventually a life. There are also a number of power-ups that will aid your quest - quick filling of tiles surrounding the bonus piece, a level skip and bonus points, for example.</story>

  <story>Fast-paced action-puzzle game where the player eliminates colored shapes that are approaching his alter ego, another colored shape, before they reach the top, ala Tetris.    In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must point your piece at it and &apos;fire&apos;. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</story>

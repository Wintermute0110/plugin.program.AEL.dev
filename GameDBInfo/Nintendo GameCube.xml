    <story>007: Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch. Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of DNA samples that are in Identicon&apos;s hands. So James Bond sets off on another adventure... The game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars. Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and Bond&apos;s trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.</story>

    <story>A nanobot has been stolen from the work of a world renowned scientist, Dr. Katya Nadanova, of the Oxford Department of Microtechnology by a man known only as the General, and has kidnapped the girl as well. James Bond races to rescue both the scientist and to retake the nanobots, and kills the General along with the nanobot samples. Bond returns Kataya to a nearby base, but it turns out the scientist has not been so faithful to Oxford. Katya meets up with Nikolai Diavolo, and gives him a hidden vial of the nanobots. Before long Bond is yet again called into action when MI6 loses contact with 003. And so Bond is off to Peru... Everything or Nothing is the second of the James Bond third-person shooters, after Tomorrow Never Dies for the Playstation. The game features new guns and a new and improved aiming system which allows you to strategically hug walls and fire around or crouch behind cover. New gadgets allow Bond to go invisible, disrupt electronics, or control mechanical spiders which allow him to access new areas. Everything or Nothing is also the first game where Pierce Brosnan actually supplies his voice for the likeness of his character, as well as many other such as Judi Dench and John Cleese. The game features a a campaign with over 30 missions and a brand new co-op game where you take the roles of newly recruited MI6 agents on investigations of their own. EON also includes a same-screen deathmatch that allows for up to four players to play.</story>

    <story>Building on 007: Everything or Nothing&apos;s range of strengths, 007: From Russia with Love is based on the 1963 film starring Sean Connery as James Bond. He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova. However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus. It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb. In most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences. The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things: bonus content like making of videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only once.</story>

    <story>4x4 Evo 2 is a sequel to the 2000 release 4x4 Evolution. This game is very similar to it&apos;s predecessor, but now it appears on newer platforms, and has more trucks, and many more tracks. The trucks in this game are licensed likenesses of trucks you may see driving down the streets of suburban America. You can purchase a truck in career mode, and then trick it out with custom parts to turn it into an off-road monster. The career mode from 4x4 Evo is again the main focus of 4x4 Evo 2. This time, crazy missions provide for an alternative to the races found in the rest of the game. For example, you may find yourself using your truck to track down lost gold, or locate misplaced outhouses. The GameCube version features four exclusive tracks and four exclusive trucks.</story>

During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a learning by doing approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough.

    <story>You&apos;re a little yellow alien. The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth. And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep. After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back? Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them. The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin. Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible. Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill. To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection. Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies. You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them. The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot). The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special PDA Game with very simple-looking graphics. Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit. Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</story>

    <story>Animal Crossing, dubbed a communication game by Nintendo, is an updated version of Animal Forest + on the Nintendo 64. In Animal Crossing, you arrive at a new town (named by you). You play as one character (who you also name) throughout the game. For an example, I named my character James, after me, and the town Toronto, after the city I grew up in. Animal Crossing has no set goal; instead, it&apos;s more of a Sims type game, in which you can do what you want, when you want, without rules, goals or time limit. When you first arrive, you will be given a house to live in. Unfortunately, you have no money, so the owner decides to make you work at his store. You can perform various tasks, such as planting flowers and trees around the store, in which you get paid in bells, the game&apos;s form of currency. There are also other ways to make money; you can perform various tasks for the other citizens of the town, you can fish and then sell your caught fish, you can collect items and sell them, or you can just find money. The most unique feature of Animal Crossing is it&apos;s use of the GameCube&apos;s internal clock. The game will run according to what your clock is set at. If your GameCube clock says it&apos;s 2:45 in the afternoon on October 1st, the game will take place at that time. If you don&apos;t play the game until October 5th, the game will pick up on October 5th. The game also uses the clock to serve a night/day cycle, a seasons cycle, and a festivities cycle. When your clock reads December 15th, the game will show snow on the ground and snow falling. When the clock reads December 25th, you will see various Christmas activities, such as Santa suits. The same applies to Halloween, Valentine&apos;s Day, etc. The game also has a night/day cycle, meaning if you play the game at 4:00pm, it&apos;ll be bright, and if you play at 11:00pm, it&apos;ll be dark. Another unique feature is the game&apos;s item system. If you wish to give an item to a friend over the Internet, you go to the store (in the game, that is), choose the item, enter your friend&apos;s name and town (exactly), and you will receive a code. You then give this code to your friend, who will type it into the game, and then receive the item. Another feature of the game is its compatibility with the GameBoy Advance. You can use the GBA to go to an entirely new island where you can create patterns that are found in the game, then transferred to your save game.

    <story>Hollywood is in an uproar - the Edgar awards for films have been stolen! The culprit is none other than C.C. Deville, who is threatening to melt down the Edgars unless he gets a ten-picture deal from Warner Bros.! Deville arrives in his airship, but accidentally crashes into the Water Tower, scattering the Edgars across the various movie lot and freeing Yakko, Wakko, and Dot at the same time. Help the Warners reclaim the Edgars! Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt is a 3D platformer where the player controls Yakko, Wakko, and Dot. Each character has their own special skills that can be unlocked as players progress through the game. For example, Dot can limbo under low walls, Wakko can dig tunnels in soft earth, and Yakko can bomb weak walls. Players progress further through the game by collecting Edgar awards which open up more areas in the Warner Movie Lots. There are also 300 collectibles in each world; players are awarded one Edgar at 150 collectibles and another at 300. In addition to this, there are also bonus mini-games guest starring Pinky and The Brain. Each of their short games features another failed attempt at world domination. The game also has the original cast of the cartoon reprising their roles for the game. There are also plenty of movie parodies, and it also takes the opportunity to riff a couple of video games as well.</story>

Command your Green troops, from the simple soldier to high powered tanks, against a former fellow Green commander who is now leading the enemy, the Tan Forces. The mission is simple, kill the traitor and his forces before all out chaos begins. Fight in the trenches of real world battle areas set in the plastic toy world, or fight in the trenches of backyard gardens, using gnomes, flowers and garden hoses as extra defense against the enemy. And just when the Tan army fall back, the ant or cockroache army come rolling in, with the wildlife getting their own back on you. The familiar Red Alert style resource management system allows you to choose from a wide range of attack and defense options. Resources themselves come from siphoning plastic and electricity from discarded toys, batteries and the like scattered around the battlefield. When you lose a building or soldier, melt it down to re-build a new building or soldier.</story>

Your primary character, Aang, is the newest incarnation of the Avatar, capable of mastering all four elements. The adventure of this game takes place between the first and second seasons on the cartoon, and is a completely separate side-story. As with most games of the action adventure genre, you view the game from a top-down viewpoint and travel around areas fighting monsters and looking for specific items required for quests to progress further through the game. The game unfolds over several chapters, and once you move on from one chapter you cannot backtrack to previous areas. As your characters levels increase with experience, they will gain new bending powers. Also as you progress through the game you will find new armor and equipment for the playable characters to use.</story>

    <story>Barnyard is an offering from THQ based on the movie of the same name from Nickelodeon. You arrive at the farm as a newbie cow, and must complete quests and earn respect in order to win keys that allow you to advance through the barnyard map. Movement is accomplished with the WASD or arrow keys, while the mouse controls the camera angle. Other keys access your inventory and the map, allow you to aim and squirt milk at opponents (even when you play as a boy!), and confirm menu selections. The map is fairly large and there are plenty of things to do beyond the missions and quests your fellow animals assign you. There are places to explore, barrels to break, and minigames like whack-a-raccoon, bowling, and bicycle races. As you play, you need to keep up your stamina, which decreases as you run around the farm. A good sleep is important; you need to be rested to fight off marauding raccoons and coyotes. And do remember not to let the Farmer catch you standing on two feet!</story>

    <story>Baten Kaitos Origins is a prequel to Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a large battle of the gods ensued, and following this the people of the world were forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the islands. The main character of the story is Sagi, a Spirit-born individual who has been given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don&apos;t actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands... Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a magna essence; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points. The battles in the game aren&apos;t random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</story>

    <story>Baten Kaitos Origins is a prequel to Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. Long ago, the evil god Malpercio attempted to destroy the other gods; a large battle of the gods ensued, and following this the people of the world were forced to flee to various islands floating in the sky. 1000 years after the war the people live peacefully in the sky for the most part; but Emperor Olgen, the emperor of one of these islands, has begun a plot to gain control of all the islands. The main character of the story is Sagi, a Spirit-born individual who has been given a secret mission to assassinate Emperor Olgen. In similar fashion to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean, you don&apos;t actually control Sagi in the game but rather his guardian spirit. Throughout the game you can give Sagi advice, and as you progress the story will unfold revealing the plot that may threaten all of the islands... Gameplay is similar to Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean and features a card based battle system. Many items in the world have a magna essence; these items can be captured in a card for use later. Some items are useful for attacking and defending, others can help replenish your health, and some can be used to solve puzzles. When a battle begins your deck of cards will be randomly dealt to you; battles are turn based, on each turn you can select cards from those visible to use. Different cards also feature different attributes, and various combos are possible. When a battle is won, your characters will earn experience points, gold, and will also recover all hit points. The battles in the game aren&apos;t random; as you explore the worlds, enemies will be visible on screen in some areas and contact with them begins the battle. In addition to the main story line, numerous sub-quests will also become available by talking with various characters; completing a sub-quest will typically earn a useful item for you as well as provide an opportunity for your characters to level up. You will encounter many types of enemies on both the main quest and subquests; since different enemies may require different strategies, you have the ability to customize the deck of cards you will use in battle. As you gain experience, you will also gain the ability to create multiple decks.</story>

    <story>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies&apos; defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened. Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners. Certain levels turn Batman Begins into a racing game, as you drive the shiny Batmobile at high speeds though Gotham City. During these missions, your progress is measured by a reputation meter, which increases when you take out cops and thugs, and decreases when you harm civilians. There is nitro available for even higher speeds and an armour meter shows the status of your car.</story>

    <story>In the future, on the planet Hillys, the population suffers from constant attacks from the alien DomZ. The situation is gradually getting worse, as the rate of DomZ kidnapings increase. The Alpha Section forces, who are in charge of protecting citizens, seem to be completely ineffective, not even fighting the DomZ. In the midst of this situation, the secretive organization IRIS alleges that the Alpha Section is involved in a massive government conspiracy, and seeks to expose the truth through journalism. You control the young reporter/photographer Jade, with her companions Pey&apos;j and Double H. After experiencing first-hand a DomZ attack, she is contacted by IRIS, who recruit her as an action reporter. Jade is now tasked with infiltrating the Alpha Section, exposing the government conspiracy, and ultimately finding the truth for herself. Beyond Good &amp; Evil is an action-adventure game with diverse game play. Most of the game is based on stealth and puzzles, but there are sequences of racing, shooting, combat, and platform action. There are several mini-games and even an online ranking system (used by entering codes online after they are assigned in-game when the game is saved). As the game progresses, a large story unfolds, even dealing with some social issues on the way.</story>

Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened. Rayne&apos;s primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne&apos;s rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne&apos;s ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.</story>

    <story>Bomberman is back in his second game for the Nintendo Gamecube. Jetters features a single-player campaign and the fan-favorite multiplayer battles. In the single-player game, players take on the roles of Bomberman and Max. Your goal is to stop the Hige Hige Bandits who plan to destroy Planet Bomber by crashing an artificial comet, Dark Star, into it. In this platforming quest, you will be aided by your use of bombs, and by Charaboms, creatures that you find that have their own special abilities that will help you progress through the game. After feeding a Charabom it will evolve, which will then make it more powerful. There are many types of Bombs and Charaboms to find throughout the single-player adventure. Jetters also contains the classic Bomberman 4-player battles in which you and up to 3 friends basically blast each other with bombs until only 1 Bomberman remains. There is a revenge feature which keeps you in the action even after you lose. If you get blown up by a bomb, you appear on the exterior of the arena and can shoot bombs at players in the game, making sure that you can always be a part of the action. There are 8 main battle arenas and many different types of multi-player battles. Bomberman Jetters was also originally released as a budget title for only $19.99, which made it less than half the price of most games when they first come out.</story>

    <story>Burnout is a arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series. In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with. There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA. There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models. One notable feature of Burnout is the Burn Meter. The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</story>

    <story>Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while keeping all 4 wheels on the ground. Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie&apos;s streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost burnout meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get! Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign. While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints. You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920&apos;s gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats. Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact packages new modes of play. Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race. Or you can reverse that with a friend. You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you. Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible. The bigger the crash, the better. Up to 4 players can compete for the best score. Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.</story>

The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you&apos;re too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom. Classic mode features a number of bubble puzzles previously seen in the Bust-A-Move series, while Normal mode has some new variations on the bubble removing theme.

Choose from many guns, bows, equipment, and clothing before heading out to take on these animals. Head out looking for whatever animal(s) you have tags for. Track your target through mountains, plains, hills, streams, and lakes. Swim across lakes and streams that are in your way and drive various vehicles to save time getting where you&apos;re going. Once you find your prey, get close enough to shoot without your target noticing you. Then take the shot! Play the game in quick hunt or career mode, or play with friends online. Go to your cabin to see the animals you have shot in career mode... you can even choose your what cabin you want out of six choices! Unlike many other hunting games that have you go out and kill what you can in a single day, you can take as many days as you need to bag your limit. Use tents to sleep away the nights, or walk around looking for possible spots to sit and wait for prey on the following day... just don&apos;t forget to eat and drink to keep up your energy. Play through rain and snow as well as clear weather conditions. Animals behave differently in different conditions, just like in real life.</story>

    <story>A beat&apos;em&apos;up with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around grooves which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character&apos;s abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove. The EO of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character&apos;s moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases. Playable characters come from the following games: 1. Street Fighter (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat) 2. Final Fight (Rolento) Street Fighter II (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangeif, M.

The GPS coordinates involve a case dealing with the infamous thief Carmen Sandiego, who Cole wants to capture despite being still just in training. It seems Carmen wants to put back together a set of stolen tribal drums that will unleash an unspeakable power. There are two other ACME operatives, Jules and Shadow, who are working on the case in Siberia at the moment so they can only help Cole with advice through email messages. The game consists of exploring nine different locales all over the world from New York to Thailand. Each locale is broken down into several areas. Each area has different items to collect. The main items to collect are compasses. These will help in locating Carmen Sandiego&apos;s whereabouts. Another item Cole can collect are puzzle pieces. Collecting these will unlock a jigsaw puzzle for Cole to solve. Also for Cole to make his way through areas, he has to defeat some enemy combatants who possess key codes. A few key codes are needed to unlock forcefields, which block the pathways to get further into the area. To defeat enemies, Cole is equipped with a staff he can use to whack enemies with. He also comes equipped with a dart gun, which he can use to hit switches he can&apos;t reach otherwise. Cole must also move stealthily through each area to avoid security measures and to get a drop on unsuspecting enemy units. Cole has other moves he can perform such as pole vaulting with his staff, rolling from a crouch position, pressing his body close to a wall, double jumping, tightrope walking, and hanging from ledges, pipes, and even ziplines. During the game, players can access a menu with various tabs. The atlas tab gives educational factoids about the area Cole is in. The map tab gives detailed information about the area that Cole is currently exploring. The GPS tab gives information about where Carmen Sandiego will be heading next. The transport tab let&apos;s the player go back to the areas they previously explored in their current location.

    <story>Chaos Field is a top-down space shooter similar in concept to the Gradius series, or Ikaruga. You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot and unique weapon systems. The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat. The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called fields, you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</story>

The franchise started out as a popular 70&apos;s television series. In the game, popular world landmarks are disappearing: the Statue Of Liberty, Arc de Triomphe, Lincoln Memorial and Stonehenge. The girls must find out who is behind this and start out at a beach beauty pageant runway wearing bikinis and move on through other levels on ships, islands or monasteries. The gameplay is a 3D brawler beat&apos;em up where the girls go to various world locations and take out bad guys with kicks, punches, jumps and combo moves. They can also block attacks and use blunt objects found in the environment to smash enemies. Occasionally, there&apos;ll be a computer terminal or button to activate, or ladder to climb. There&apos;s some slow-motion and cinematic camera angles at times. Defeat bosses to move onwards. Hidden throughout the levels are items such as movie reels and memory sticks that when collected can unlock photos and trailers from the movie Charlie&apos;s Angels: Full Throttle.</story>

    <story>Introducing Chibi-Robo, the four inch high rechargeable robot whose sole purpose is to make its owners happy! Accompanied by its talkative guide Telly Vision, Chibi-Robo makes its way through the dysfunctional Sanderson household, trying its best to make the family members happy. It won&apos;t be easy though - their daughter thinks she&apos;s a frog, the wife is furious at the husband for wasting money and makes him sleep on the couch, and if that wasn&apos;t enough, there are reports of spider-like robots out to destroy Chibi-Robo! Chibi-Robo! is a platform adventure game with a difference - players control a small robot called Chibi-Robo, whose short size means that regular objects like furniture and stairs become gargantuan obstacles for it to overcome. Its battery is consistently draining while not plugged into a wall outlet, and its power consumption increases when it uses tools like its blaster, copter or radar. Because of this, players must keep an eye on their remaining power and regularly recharge. The aim of the game is to earn Happy Points to increase Chibi-Robo&apos;s rank and become Super Chibi-Robo. It can do this by performing simple tasks (such as throwing away trash or cleaning floor stains like muddy footprints) or by making its owners happy, such as giving a rose as a gift to Jenny, the frog-obsessed daughter.</story>

Susan is a raged fighter and she can throw arrows, tennis balls and snowballs. Edmund is a decent melee fighter who can climb trees and walk on ice without breaking it. Lucy has the ability to heal the other children, go through small spaces and stand on big snowballs and make them roll. During each level you can switch between characters at any time.

    <story>In Conflict Desert Storm, you control a squad of four soldiers from either the British S.A.S or American Delta Force. The game is set during the first gulf war back in the early 1990s and has ideas borrowed from the book Bravo Two Zero and other real missions from the war. You are sent behind enemy lines to command a squad of elite commandos, set to destroy key strategic sites in Iraq. On your team is Bradley, the team leader, Conners, the heavy weapons man, Jones, the explosives and anti-tank expert, and Foley, the team sniper. Each soldier has different skills which can be built up by killing enemies. As your troops gain more experience, they will gain ranks and upgrade their skills. As their skills get better, the more effective they become at doing their job. For example, Foley will have more stable aiming or Jones will plant C4 faster as their skills increase. Conflict: Desert Storm is a first person/third person shooter, and each mode can be switched by the press of a button. You and your team are sent on missions with specific objectives, whether it be to infiltrate a base, destroy a SAM site, or assassinate an opposing general. You can both control your men individually and send them orders. Your men can be ordered to attack, retreat, follow, stay, and do many more things. If the mission requires it, you must drive tanks and jeeps around while your squad mans the guns on the vehicle. There is also the ability to play up to four player co-op with friends, with each person controlling a soldier in your squad. At the end of each mission, if you performed well, your men are awarded medals for their bravery. If you work hard enough, you may even be able to earn the Medal of Honor.</story>

    <story>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex). The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</story>

    <story>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can&apos;t be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly. Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).</story>

Even water ripples away from a falling step in squares. Blood pools in squares upon the ground and even the moon and sun appear as cubes in the sky.

    <story>Curious George is a platformer based on the animated movie of the same name. Ted Shackleford, a human with a big yellow hat, visits Africa in search for an idol. This project does not work out, but he finds a new friend: the monkey Curious George. The game follows their way back to America and shows scenes from the movie as cutscenes. During the thirteen linear levels, the player takes control over George. The majority of time is spent with platform challenges which usually involve jumping or swinging over gaps. Frequently the levels are interrupted by mini games, Those involve simple tasks, for example rhythm sequences (pressing given buttons with the correct timing) or arcade sequences. Optionally the player can collect bananas on the way and receive special points by interacting with certain objects. Those are used to unlock bonus content: the cutscenes and mini games already experienced during regular play as well as a few hats for George to wear.</story>

    <story>This is the fourth installment in the Custom Robo series, but the first one to be released outside of Japan. On an unknown planet in the future, custom robos are used for criminal purposes. Those who can manipulate the robots through brain waves are called Commanders. When you and your comrades learn of a strong, autonomous maneuvering robot, you decide to investigate the matter. The game mixes action (fighting), simulation (assembling) and RPG elements (do some detective work to unravel the mystery) in a single game. You can construct your own robot with over 200 parts, including over 50 guns, 30 bombs, 30 pods and 15 legs. In a typical arena match, you have to fight real-time battles and victory means you can acquire new parts and continue with the storyline. As there are different kinds of battles (two-on-two, tag team, four-player battle royale), you have to use different strategies and make use of the obstacles in the arena.</story>

    <story>Dakar 2 is a racing game, of course simulating the famous Paris-Dakar Rally. Although not the real 6000 kilometers can be crossed in the game, the rally mode takes the player through 12 tracks all the way from France to Dakar. The tracks lead racers through cities, forests and the desert. Most of them are simple tracks, but there are desert tracks where the player can drive around freely, finding the checkpoints faster than the opponents. The player can choose from the officially licensed cars, trucks and bikes from Dakar 2002, but only vehicles of the same type can compete in a race. There is also an arcade racing mode, where all the tracks and vehicles that have been unlocked in rally mode can be selected, as well as a splitscreen mode for two players.</story>

    <story>Dead To Rights is an action-game, straight out. You play as Jack Slate, a police officer in Grant City. On a routine call, you find a dead body; the body is your father. Later framed, Jack becomes a fugitive, on the run from the law. Your quest will take you to various places, from strip joints and hotels, to office complexes, and even prison... as an inmate. Dead To Rights is an action game in every sense of the word. When fighting, you have the opportunity to perform various moves, such as grabbing an enemy from behind and using him as a human shield, to tossing a fire extinguisher and shooting it, causing a huge explosion. When against an enemy and you have no gun drawn, you can perform &amp;quot;disarm&amp;quot; moves, which causes your character to steal the enemy&apos;s gun, then performing some sort of finishes, such as a neck breaker. Initially, only a few disarm moves are available, but more can be unlocked as your progress. A unique addition in this game allows you to control Jack&apos;s best friend, and partner, Shadow, his K-9 dog. Using Shadow, you can kill enemies from far away, and retrieve their gun in Shadow&apos;s jaws. Dead To Rights features adrenaline combat, which is similar to that of &amp;quot;Bullet-Time&amp;quot; from Max Payne. You can perform slow-motion dives and spins, giving you an advantage, as long as your adrenaline holds out.</story>

    <story>Def Jam: Fight for NY is the sequel to the out-of-left-field Def Jam: Vendetta. The game opens with the person you beat in the previous game, D-Mobb, being arrested. As the police are driving, an SUV comes out of nowhere and smashes into the car, setting D-Mobb free. After a quick cutscene, it turns out the person who was driving the SUV was you, and you have now joined D-Mobb&apos;s crew. Fight for NY&apos;s story mode takes you through the ranks, and pits you against tougher and tougher fighters. You start off in D-Mobb&apos;s crew as a nobody, and will have to work your way up, fighting off people from other crews, including D-Mobb&apos;s rival, Crow. You&apos;ll take part mostly in one-on-one brawls, with the odd team match and free for all thrown in. To aid you in fighting, you can use the environment to hurt your enemy. You can smash people into wooden/cement walls, fences, or just whack them off of a wooden pillar. Speakers, soda machines, garbage cans... All there to harm your enemy (or you). Some objects are interactive, such as flood lights, which will change the lighting of the ring once someone&apos;s been thrown into them. You have weapons at your disposal, usually a metal pipe, pool cue and broken bottle. The crowd also gets into the action, which can be good or bad for you. You can throw an enemy into a crowd and have them push him towards you; you can knock a stunned enemy into the crowd, and they will hold him down, giving you free shots; or you can throw an opponent into a part of the crowd holding a weapon, and they&apos;ll use the weapon against him. There are five fighting styles available to you. There is Street Fighting, which focuses on punches; Kickboxing, which focuses on kick attacks; Martial Arts, which focuses on speed, running, and acrobatic attacks; Wrestling, which focuses on standard wrestling moves, like bodyslams; and Submissions, which focus on wearing down a specific part of the enemy until that limb is damaged enough to earn a submission. In addition to Story mode, you have Battle mode, which allows you to play with up to four players in different types of matches. Fight for NY has lots of unlockables. Earning reward points from Battle matches, you can purchase new fighters or venues to fight in.</story>

As more swarms of Manti arrive, even the colonies are now in danger of being wiped out. You&apos;ve been enlisted to help save the remaining colonists and destroy the Manti bugs! There are a total of six different ships to fly, each with its own flight characteristics and special weapons. Weapon and shield power-ups can also be found throughout the various missions. As in the original version of Defender, the Manti will try to capture any humans they can find to change them into mutants to increase their attack force. To increase chances of success you will need to rescue captured humans before this happens and bring them to a safe landing zone. Saving colonists will also earn you some credits, which can later be used to buy improved weapons or shields for you ship. Also included are several video extras detailing the historical perspective of and the making of Defender.</story>

You are in John&apos;s shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane&apos;s old enemy, is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John&apos;s now adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy. This game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game. There are several different weapons available in the game, ranging from a paintball gun for training to a sniper rifle. Most of the guns can also be used dual for the ultimate killing spree.</story>

    <story>Disney Sports Basketball is the fourth and last in a series of GameCube-exclusive games that combine popular sports with Disney characters, offering three-on-three hoops. Players can select from eight different teams, captained by the Disney characters Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy, Max, Huey and Mortimer, with the two remaining players on each team filled by generic characters (except for Huey, who is joined by his brothers). Each team comes with their own home arena. Available playing modes include exhibition games (for up to four players), a 14-game season (7 home, 7 away games) and a Challenge Cup, which is a competition against six other teams in freely selectable order, followed by games against the bad guy teams of Mortimer and Pete. Winning the Challenge Cup unlocks the All-Star Game mode, for which teams consisting of only the star characters can be selected. A tutorial mode that teaches the game&apos;s controls in distinct lessons is also available. Controls on the court are simple, with one button for shooting, one for stopping the dribble and keeping the ball away from the defender, and two for passing to the other two teammates. On defense, two buttons block and steal and two switch to the other players. Scoring increases a power meter that when full, enables special moves and super dunks that net more points than usual. Going with the arcade flavor of the game, there are no fouls or free throws.</story>

One good way of doing that is having the monsters knock each other over with balls, resulting in a dodgeball-like game. The game includes 13 characters and 7 arenas based on locations from the film. At the start of a single-player game, only 5 characters and the training arena are accessible, others have to be unlocked by advancing through the levels. There are 5 levels for each arena, for a total of 35 levels plus one final challenge. Selectable characters vary in speed and throwing power. Goals vary between levels and include scoring more points than the opponents, being the last monster standing, hitting a number of targets or holding on to a special ball the longest. Balls spawn on the ground and must be picked up and thrown at opponents or targets to score points, knock off one of their lives or free a held ball. To avoid being hit, balls can be blocked or dodged. Various special balls with unique properties exist. These include stun balls that knock out opponents temporarily, bubble balls that trap them in a soap bubble, yo-yo balls that come back to the thrower, pet balls that follow their owners around, and many more. Multiplayer modes include Buddy, which is a two-player co-op mode, Team, which allows two-versus-two matchups, and Party, which is free-for-all four a maximum of four players. Arenas and characters must be unlocked in single-player mode.</story>

In Jungle Beat, you still have to match the rhythm by hitting the bongos timely, but the visual presentation is a platformer, much like a regular Donkey Kong game. You control Donkey Kong by hitting the left or right bongos, while tapping both drums together or clapping allows for jumps, vine-swinging, wall-kicks, ground pounding and other moves. You have to cross 40 areas to rid the island of evil kongs. During your journey, you can travel using a variety of animals, and they each need a certain rhythm to control. Aside from the input device, it is a regular platformer with power-ups, bananas to collect, many enemies and end bosses. There are two versions of the game - one with the DK Bongos included and a lower-priced version without the device.</story>

    <story>Reiji Ozora is a lazy, good-for-nothing, completely unmotivated junior high school student. His friend Maiko shows him a popular virtual reality game called Dragon Drive, in which players face off against each other using dragons. Reiji&apos;s personality nets him a small, lazy dragon which he names Chibisuke, but it turns out there&apos;s more to it, and Reiji himself, than it would seem at first. Dragon Drive: D-Masters Shot is a third-person action shooter based on the anime Dragon Drive, and the original manga by Kenichi Sakura. The player takes the role of Reiji as he plays the virtual reality game with his dragon Chibisuke, fighting against other players in Virtual On-style arena battles, and through free-roaming and on-rails shooting sections similar to Panzer Dragoon. Also included in the package is a bonus disc which features an episode of the anime series.</story>

Eddy is the fearless leader, eager to make a quick buck; Ed is the tall, strong and stupid one, while Edd (or Double-Dee) is the smart, polite neat-freak, who communicates with his family through sticky notes. Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures allows you to play as the trio through a series of levels, called &apos;scams&apos;. Each level is a get-rich-quick scheme dreamed up by Eddy, allowing the Eds to get some jawbreakers. Each level can be accessed via the hub world, the &apos;Cul-de-sac&apos;, where the Eds have their adventures and meet other neighborhood kids. Players control all three Eds; more specifically, they&apos;re always in control of an Ed, and the other two tag along. You can switch your Ed at any time with the press of a button. Each Ed has their own abilities: Eddy can hurl stink bombs and form a tower to reach high objects, Ed can dig in sandpits, lift and throw objects, and charge at things to smash them, while Double Dee can use his slingshot, activate machines, and be thrown high into the air by the other two Eds.</story>

    <story>Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player&apos;s structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen. There are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent&apos;s tower first wins.</story>

From time immemorial the forces of evil from beyond have been trying to manifest themselves in our world, and it is only through the actions of these forgotten heroes that the world has been saved from being overrun. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword and gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun. The game features an involved Magick system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items. Eternal Darkness: Sanity&apos;s Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items. Aside from this, characters also have health and mana meters.</story>

The cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit and so minimize the chances of crashing.</story>

    <story>This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie Fantastic 4. Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka Doctor Doom as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</story>

    <story>Featuring a brand new engine (replacing the one used in five titles since FIFA 2003), FIFA 06 features new controls and gameplay, the most visible being more animations and better detailed ball and player physics and animation, the removal of the unpopular Off the Ball controls implemented in their 2004 version and remaking the free-kick interface so it&apos;s no longer obvious if the player decided for a shot on goal or a pass to a forward. Also new is the concept of Team Chemistry which affects how well a team plays collectively. Featuring 26 leagues from 19 countries, 29 real stadiums and over 10&apos;000 players with data for the 2005-06 seasons, as well as international teams, the game kept the Create a player feature as well as the many managing options untouched from previous versions. Career mode, the 15-year long climb to the top of the game, features new options such as sponsorships (which will only accept good results), player contracts and more weight on the player morale: a demoralized player (usually from not playing or possible influence from random events) is more likely to under-perform as well as pressuring the Team Chemistry values downwards and might refuse attempts to renew his contract, leaving on a free transfer. While there are still many unlockables in the game (mostly third kits), the way to earn points changed. Instead of gaining points from completing tasks (from entering the EA Trax or creating a player to winning the Champions League or completing a career), the player has over 100 scenarios to way in five difficulty levels.</story>

    <story>Enhancing the engine debuted with the previous game and official 2006 World Cup game, FIFA Soccer 07 includes enhanced ball and player collision physics and more player animations adding to the 16 trick moves and first touch ball reception introduced to the game engine with the previous games in the series. Players can choose between 2 and 10 minutes halves in three different game speeds and four different difficulty levels. Over 510 teams are accurately represented in the game. 27 leagues from 20 nations are included, along a Rest of the World for the best teams in championships left outside the game and international teams. Spain, England (with two), France, Germany and Italy also feature second divisions. Players can also create two clubs, customizing their badge, kits and home stadium, selecting players from anywhere in the game, along the starting budget in manager mode. The player creation tool remains mostly unchanged, with the ability to customize everything, from faces (with a complete set of options, from jaw width to eyebrow shape) to the appearance and playing abilities. While the focus of this yearly update was on the game engine, the Manager mode was also enhanced: players now also improve their playing ability from being active members of the squad, forcing the player to choose between keeping his celebrated stars near retirement in the starting eleven, or give the benefits of the youth system a chance to shine. Another new feature, in what is now the primary mode of the series, is the ability to watch the game in a simplified text mode, with the ability to jump into action to turn the events still available. The points system was replaced by a less abstract currency model (with the ability to choose between Pounds, Euros or Dollars). Other game modes include Tournaments (including the creation of custom tournaments) and Challenges. By completing challenges (similar to the Global Challenges mode in World Cup 2006) the player can spend points in the Fanshop with items such as new teams, a special overhead camera, new balls from Adidas (including all original World Cup balls from 1974 to 2002), stadiums, third kits and special celebrations for created players. Finally, online gaming received a new mode: Interactive Leagues. These are online-only leagues based on the fixtures of their real counterparts (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga and Mexican 1st division). Then, online players go head -to-head with their favorite teams with a victory counting one vote for their favorite team. Once the week is over, the team with more votes is declared the winner of the week, getting three points. The number of weekly matches a player can do in this mode is unlimited.</story>

Some of these new features including a Freestyle control, which is activated by the right thumbstick, causing you to do special moves, such as a deke, or kick the ball a fair length forwards to gain some speed. New and improved dead ball control makes corner kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and gives you more options. The passing game has been improved as to allow better passing by kicking directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in particular, or open passing to allow anybody to take it.

    <story>FIFA Soccer 2004 features eighteen leagues, with thirty-five national teams and over ten thousand players. Take them into a multi-season career, or individual tournaments or matches. Like EA&apos;s other 2004 games it has an in depth career mode, where you must manage your budget and team. Promote players, demote players and renegotiate contracts, all in an effort to get your team to the finals again and again. The skills to master range from kicked passes and headers to lob passes and bicycle kicks. You can take control of players before the ball reaches them, which makes it easier to find space to take the ball. Like other 2004 titles, FIFA uses the right analog stick for it&apos;s Freestyle gameplay. Console versions use the EA Sports Bio, whereby you can continue to improve your gamer level and unlock rewards by playing other 2004 titles, such as Madden NFL 2004 or NBA Live 2004.</story>

    <story>Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it&apos;s not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It&apos;s also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a light managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff). The main gameplay change was the addition of First Touch controls. By performing one of the trick moves before the player gets possession of the ball it&apos;s possible to do a number of moves, such as touching the ball forward to gain a few yards ahead of the defenders or touch the ball to one side, and roll to the other of a rushing defender, and then pickup up the ball a bit ahead leaving the opponent stranded, and the inclusion of a fake shot move, which allows forwards to sit a goalkeeper before scoring in style or make defenders jump from their positions, opening room for a through pass or a run into goal. Other aspects of the game, such as the Off The Ball controls (allows the control of players that aren&apos;t in possession, moving them into an open position) remain unchanged. Another new feature is the FIFA Shop, where the player can trade points earned in many ways, from simple tasks like having a peek at the Jukebox to obtaining 10 victories in a row in Career mode, for several items, such as third jerseys, additional music, more balls and night stadiums. As it became the norm with the series, the game features 18 leagues and 38 national teams (some of these, due to licensing problems feature only generic kits and logos), summing up around 11&apos;000 real footballers.</story>

The Total Boxer Control, which lets you throw punches by making certain movements with the analog stick, has been improved. There are also many ways to customize the appearance of your character, up to the shaping of the cranium and ears.

    <story>The world is enveloped in a poisonous vapor. Anyone who comes into contact with it must die. But humans have learned to develop a technology that would help them to protect themselves from the deadly vapor. The light of Crystals shines in small villages and in large towns. But those protective Crystals have to be refilled every year with the purifying Mana Water, otherwise their energy will extinguish. Every year, villages send four youths to retrieve the Mana Water that is hidden deep in dungeons and dangerous caves. Sounds like the story of the first Final Fantasy? The plot of this first Final Fantasy game for a Nintendo console since Final Fantasy VI goes back to the roots of the series, but the gameplay has changed a lot. Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is an action, Zelda-style RPG. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses one of the four available character classes: magic-using Yulks, thief-like Selkies, gentle-natured Clavattes, and cute little Lilties. The game can be played with the chosen character in single-player mode, or, using the GBA-GC connection link, played with three other people, each controlling their own character. Each character has both armor and a weapon that can be replaced by crafting a new one with the appropriate items in towns. Found in each monster-filled area are artifacts that raise statistic points until the end of the area, and upon completion one artifact can be kept to raise that stat permanently. In a multiplayer game players will be given secret objectives, and by completing their objective they have a chance at claiming first dibs on artifacts at the end of the area. Spells are also found in combat areas, though they can not be taken out of them. If spells are placed next to each other in the quick select list, or cast near each other in a multiplayer game, they will merge and become a more powerful spell. Finally in single player mode a moggle will take care of holding the bucket that pushes away the toxic miasma around the party, but in a multiplayer game one of the players will have to take up this ignoble task.</story>

Set on the Tellius continent, a soldier called Ike rescues the princess of Crimea and finds out that the Daein kingdom has invaded the country. He must guide her with his fellow mercenaries to Gallia. During the journey, the true reasons for the war are revealed. You command your units across a 3D battlefield with turn-based mechanics. Each turn, you can only move a set amount of spaces over the grid. Turns can be used to visit locations, use items or attack enemies. Each battle is stats-based and has a specific objective. You do not fight yourself, instead you control the items and weapons to influence the stats, and make use of the enemies&apos; weaknesses. The maps have different scenarios, where you have to rescue a certain character, create distractions to move past enemies, or kill certain foes. The game is heavy on anime-styled story sequences. As with all Fire Emblem games, the characters are unique individuals that cannot be revived when they fall in battle. In order to continue with the story, only the team leaders need to survive. Characters can equip a range of weapons and possess magical abilities. Upon discovering &apos;hidden purposes&apos;, unique abilities can be acquired.</story>

There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first. The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total. The racing game, or Freekstyle mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into freakout mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed.

The game focuses on action and fun instead of realism. You play four on four in five game modes: Turf War, Home Turf, Street Challenge Cup, Exhibition and Multiplayer. The first requires you to conquer neighborhoods in the city by winning soccer matches against rival gangs. Street Challenge Cup allows you to play an entire competition. Each player can perform a large variety of moves beyond the typical soccer game moves, such as scissor kicks, midair juggles and bicycle kicks. Performing said moves allows you to gain skill points which can be used to unlock new game modes, teams, courts and cheats. Next to these special moves you can also interact with the environment. Your players can pick things up and throw them around or manually hit your opponents.</story>

    <story>A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in. There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you&apos;ll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird&apos;s eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals. While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.</story>

Filming is done in the toon world and then sent to the real world for editing and production, thus reducing the tedium and cost of animation. However the animation industry is under heavy pressure from new computer generated techniques of animating. In an effort to revitalize traditional Cel animation the real world Studio SPUMCO will be creating a cartoon based on Extreme Skating. And so auditions begin in the Toon World. The cast of characters are all Cel-Shaded and mostly anthropomorphisms. You will control one of them through eight large sets to try and be selected for the cartoon. You collect points by doing what you would do in any skateboarding game, grinding, jumping, the usual ticks. However, here there is a twist. Seeing as you are a cartoon you can gain points by being beheaded crushed and other familiar animated antics. Sometimes a level will consist of a battle or a race. The game also contains a two player versus mode.</story>

    <story>The Wii game GT Pro Series or GT Cube as the Japanese-only GameCube release, is a cel-shaded racing game that is a soft-simulation of real-world racing. The game allows you access to over 80 tunable vehicles from ten different Japanese manufacturers. Many of these cars are locked and must be obtained by playing through the game. In addition, there are several modes of play to use them on, which are Championship, Quick Race, Time Attack, Versus, and Drift-Combo. A fairly standard staple in the racing genre, the Championship is a rather straight forward career mode. In this mode, you have four classes ranging from Beginner to Professional. Beginner is free to get in, but the next three classes require you to finish the previous class and then acquire a license by passing a series of driving tests. Certain races in each class have limits on what cars can be entered, forcing you to mix things up a bit and develop different strategies. Quick Race is good if you just want to jump into the game and start. You can use any parts, cars and tracks you&apos;ve unlocked so far from the Championship mode. Time Attack is a time trial mode where the object is to get the best time you can with the car and track you choose. Versus is the game&apos;s multiplayer mode. Two to four players can battle it out with any unlocked cars and tracks. Drift-Combo is a challenging mode that scores you based one how well you can drift on a selection of three drift courses. Connecting drifts raises your score and subsequently, your ranking on the board.</story>

    <story>The Wild Wild West meets Grand Theft Auto in this free-roaming action game. Set in 1870, you are Colton White, a young gunslinger whose father is killed by an Indian tribe led by Reverend Reed. Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you. The main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear. You will have to fight duels, defend towns against bandits, help build railway tracks, intervene in various conflicts and kill heavily-armed bossed. There are also many side missions or alternative ways to earn money. You can play poker in the casino, help out farmers with their livestock, assist the local sheriff or deliver items with the pony express. Other possibilities include bounty hunting, regular hunting for rare animals, mining for gold and various rescue missions. The RPG elements involve acquiring and improving skills, such as QuickDraw (shown in Bullet Time,) Zoom Firing, Melee Combat, improved accuracy, the ability to throw axes and strategically equipping and upgrading different weapons. There are hand weapons (knives, tomahawks, bayonets), archery arms, explosive throwable items and regular guns, such as sharpshooter rifles, colts and winchesters. Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns. The GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation: horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness and caves.</story>

    <story>Quidditch, the broomstick and ball “sport” of the Harry Potter world comes to life in this simulation. For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other. For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and “strategies” of Quidditch are faithfully recreated. The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for. Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams. As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as “score 120 points in one game”) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves. Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with it’s own style and special combo moves. After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams. People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings&apos; books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch. Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the “golden snitch bar”. As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar. Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase. Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential). Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc…). It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two player (same machine) exhibition matches</story>

    <story>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an action adventure game which follows the story of the fourth movie and book of the same name. In addition to the usual challenges and dangers that Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to face, the Triwizard Tournament will be held at Hogwarts and mysteriously Harry is in the tournament! One to three players control Harry, Ron, and Hermione (the computer controls the remaining characters for one and two player games). Played with a third person view, you will need to complete numerous game levels which feature a variety of action and puzzle solving as well as completing the three tasks in the Triwizard Tournament and facing Lord Voldemort. Each character has magic spells that can be used to help out, and additional spells can be learned as you make your way through the game. Occasionally all three characters will need to work together to complete a task, such as moving a particularly large object or defeating a tough opponent. During the game you will come across Bertie Bott&apos;s Every-Flavor Beans; collecting these can help out by restoring stamina or magic powers. Additionally at the end of each level the Beans can be used to purchase collector cards; these are used to increase a characters abilities.</story>

    <story>Based off the third book and movie of the series, players now take control of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in this 3D adventure as they face the dangers of their third year of Hogwarts, avoiding the soul-stealing Dementors, and trying to solve the mystery of escaped convict Sirius Black. Players will navigate through the castle of Hogwarts and beyond, as they learn new spells and how to work together as a team, solving multiple puzzles and avoiding traps that will either require teamwork, or one of the kid&apos;s particular skills. Harry can leap across chasms and climb ropes. Ron can sense secret areas. Hermione, being the smallest, can fit into areas where the others can&apos;t. Players can also control Hedwig the owl, or Buckbeak the hippogriff to accomplish other tasks and overcome obstacles. Survive the year, learn new spells, and discover the truth of Sirius Black&apos;s role during the night Harry became known as The Boy Who Lived.</story>

    <story>Two years after versions on other platforms, the then-current consoles got their own adaptation of the first Harry Potter book and film. Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter&apos;s first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action adventure title. After a tutorial at Ollivander&apos;s Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book. Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There&apos;s also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin. After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas: collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry&apos;s health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George&apos;s shop for more cards and some other useful items.</story>

The game is a farming simulation in which the player inherits a run-down farm and must make it profitable, start a family and develop relationships with the neighbors. The major difference is that the player is now female rather than male and can choose a husband and have a child. Other additions are the ability to change outfits and a mirror in the house that will tell the player if she needs to eat or sleep. The game spans six chapters but will end after the first chapter if the player doesn&apos;t get married. The Game Boy Advance game Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town can be connected to this game to unlock extra bonuses.</story>

    <story>Harvest Moon: Magical Melody returns to the concept of the original Harvest Moon game, excluding much of the newer features brought into later titles. Returning to the game are full 30 day seasons, festivals, and the top-down look of the originals. Also a first for the Harvest Moon series, play as either a male or a female (note: there is only a male character in the European/PAL version!) and choose from numerous spouses to marry. Other new features include buying land, placing furniture in the player&apos;s house, and numerous other things. Multiplayer mini games are also available to unlock, to play with friends and family. Another feature is the rival system, where an opponent also tries to save the Harvest Goddess, win prizes in festivals, and be the one who ships most items on a daily basis. In the English version, the player may eventually even marry their rival, but this ends the game. Next to finding a spouse, the second major quest is saving the goddess. To do so, the player needs to reach goals to gather musical notes, to form the titular magic melody.</story>

    <story>The perfect hitman, Agent 47, tries to distance himself from his violent past and becomes a humble church gardener. But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there&apos;s a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. The guards aren&apos;t completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they&apos;ll react if they see you waving around a gun. They&apos;ll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they&apos;ll eventually realize you&apos;re not one of their buddies. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a Mass Murderer, while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the Silent Assassin rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.</story>

    <story>Home Run King is an MLB-licensed baseball game released exclusively for the GameCube. Designed more as a pick-up-and-play game than a detailed simulation, it offers fast-paced gameplay and a basic selection of modes. Modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Home Run Derby. The game features team customization and player creation and trading. Players will control all aspects of play: pitching, batting, fielding and running. The pitching interface features a pitch type selector that displays the pitches available to the current player as lines whose length indicates their effectiveness. Pitches are selected by moving the control stick in the appropriate direction, and then pressing the appropriate button for normal, slow or fast pitches or pick-off throws. A timing gauge must be stopped at the maximum point for best results. The batting interface reuses the pitch type selector, this time for predicting the pitch that is thrown. A batting cursor must be moved to meet the incoming ball to hit it. If the correct pitch was predicted, the cursor is larger and makes hitting easier. Bunts as well as normal, power and contact swings are possible. During fielding, an icon indicates the ball&apos;s height and position, and the A button can be pressed to make a super play: diving or sliding after the ball. Before the pitch is made, runners can be made to increase their lead for an attempted steal. Running is otherwise automatic, with only the destination base selectable.</story>

Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice) and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there&apos;s also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</story>

In ISS 3 you can choose from Friendly mode, International Cup, Custom League, World League or Training mode, where you will take part with the best national teams. You will also count with a points system, where for every match you win you will accumulate points that later can be given away in exchange for extra moves, extra modes or stadiums. There&apos;s also a Mission mode, which is quite similar to the Scenario mode previously seen in the earlier ISS games. The game itself has many arcade components, as the possibility to execute spectacular dribblings adorned with flashes and lights or the fact that you can&apos;t usually make poor directed shots. The players will also look like their counterparts in real life.</story>

    <story>Jeremy McGrath Supercross World features 10-time supercross champion Jeremy McGrath and his heir apparent, Travis Pastrana, as well as eight other top supercross pros, including Sebastian Tortelli, Ezra Lusk, Tim Ferry, Grant Langston, Mike Brown, Ernesto Fonseca, Nathan Ramsey, and James Stewart. The game&apos;s 25 supersized tracks encompass indoor supercross, outdoor motocross, freestyle, and, for the first time in a supercross game, Baja mode. The game is designed for anyone to pick up and play, but it also offers depth of gameplay. You can ride as any of the pros for a quick freestyle tournament with your friends, or battle your way through the championship mode for a longer gaming experience. The game features an innovative stunt advantage system: when players perform a stunt and land it correctly, they&apos;ll receive a brief speed boost or other skill advantage. It pays to be on point with your aerial skills. Each track has various minichallenges. Every time a player completes a challenge for a track, he or she will earn a trophy. The game&apos;s freestyle mode packs two-dozen tricks, including nac-nacs, supermans, fender grabs, 360s, and barrel rolls. The freestyle arenas are wide-open outdoor and indoor areas where you&apos;ll have plenty of room to perform mind-bending tricks by yourself or head-to-head with a friend. The attribute system is broken down into eight attributes (four rider and four bike). Rider attributes (stability, slide, preload, and charisma) can be upgraded as a reward for doing well in career mode. Bike attributes (power band, top speed, cornering, and suspension) are preconfigured for each bike. The gamer will have to determine the best way to allocate earned attribute points on top of his or her bike attributes. Gamers who optimize rider and bike attributes will have the best chance of winning it all. In addition, the game offers head-to-head split-screen gameplay. Race your friends in any of our four split-screen modes: Baja, freestyle, indoor supercross, or outdoor motocross. </story>

The comic book character who acts as judge, jury, and executioner makes another video game appearance in a first-person shooter set in the 22nd century, where crime and hopelessness run rampant amidst the chaos left behind from a nuclear holocaust. Players must enforce the law using any means necessary within the sprawling, overpopulated Mega-City One, which serves as the gritty backdrop for Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death. Players will battle vampires, the undead, and even a cadre of Dark Judges as they try to maintain some semblance of order in a world gone wild. In keeping with the spirit of the comic, some perpetrators of lesser crimes need to be arrested while others must be taken out with extreme prejudice. The ultimate goal is to confront the evil Judge Death, who has taken it upon himself to cause as much mayhem and destruction to the beleaguered city as possible.</story>

In order to bribe the guard and get aboard Hunter&apos;s ship, Kao must collect lots of coins scattered throughout the game. The main character can fight with his boxing gloves and can throw lethal boomerangs. The game consists of 25 levels in 5 different worlds. Playing through the levels, the player must jump over platforms, make difficult leaps, and fight about 30 different types of enemies, free captured friends and solve many puzzles. Occasionally Kao will get to ride a vehicle like a barrel or a snowmobile. Kao can also find purple crystals, which can be spent to buy minigames to play. There are also stars - collecting 50 of them will upgrade one of Kao&apos;s abilities, e.g. giving him the ability to stomp on the ground to defeat enemies around him. A rarely encountered item is a winged helmet, which, when grabbed, allows Kao to fly for a short while.</story>

    <story>Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it&apos;s easy to jump into the game and surf. PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the GBA description. Game Play Modes: Infinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. High Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get? Icon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out. Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play. Multiplayer Modes: Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to push the split screen towards their opponent&apos;s half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen. Head to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out. Time Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent. The Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters. The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren&apos;s Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways. The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk&apos;s Pro Skater 4 GBA description Surf Modes: Championship - Compete against 8 other surfers. You progress by surfing in 12 stages, 3 heats per stage. Your surf score is tallied from each heat and the top 3 surfers of the stage get to move on. Challenge - Pick a surfer and do challenges around the world. Drop In - Instant action surfing - go and just surf. Multiplayer - With a Link Cable and another copy of the game you and a friend can link up to compete against each other. The Pros are the same as above.

Garcian is the leader of the pack and the only one who can communicate with Harman and revive the bodies of slain personalities. During the game, you can change characters at any time and any place. Depending of the persona you play with, Killer7 mixes stealth and adventure with pure action.

    <story>After two adventures on the Game Boy Advance, Kururin goes 3D on the GameCube. In Kururin Squash!, you have to direct Kururin in his helicopter-like Heririn spinning stick through narrow mazes, while avoiding obstacles or courses&apos; sides. The gameplay is spiced up with colourful backgrounds, bizarre enemies, weapons and bounce pads that change the spin direction. When you get hit three times, the Heririn shatters. The GameCube version introduces water levels with a submarine, guns, boxing gloves, twisters, flame-throwing and boss battles. In the main puzzle mode, you have to collect loot and in the race mode, you have to finish the mazes within a target time. Multiplayer includes four-player split-screen frenzy and a battle mode where you have to collect coins while using the weapons to hold off your opponents.</story>

    <story>Legend is the seventh major game in the Tomb Raider series, now for the first time developed by Crystal Dynamics, along with the original character designer of the game&apos;s protagonist Lara Croft: Toby Gard. Heroine Lara is searching for a South American relic, but her adventure takes a different course when rogue anthropologist Amanda Evert shows up. Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara&apos;s past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden. The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip. Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location. The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode: Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.</story>

    <story>Following the events of Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, over 200 years the vampire Kain has assembled an army of vampires to take over the world of the humans. Fighting across Nosgoth, goal is to make his way to the great city of Meridian and take control of this stronghold. However upon reaching the gates of the city, the army is challenged by the Serafan Order, an organized force of vampire hunters and it&apos;s leader, the magical Serafan lord. Kain engages the Serafan Lord in single combat, and is struck down and defeated, Kain&apos;s sword, the Soul Reaver, is claimed by his enemy. Unconscious for 200 years, Kain awakes under the care of the vampire Umah to a world he barely recognizes. Having lost it&apos;s army, the vampires have been hunted down by the Serafan and only a few remain. The city of Meridian is ruled under martial law by the Serafan Order and demands great things of it&apos;s citizens. Strange Glyph magic is used to power machines and fuel industry, but at the same time is deadly to vampires and used as wards throughout the city. Kain swears vengeance on the opponent who defeated him and seeks to reclaim his place as ruler of the vampires. The Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 is a 3rd person adventure game, more similar in perspective to Soul Reaver than the first Blood Omen game. The player controls from behind Kain&apos;s shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use dark gifts and grab on to ledges. Kain&apos;s life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform stealth kills which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar. The Serafan use Glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progress because of Glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph circuit in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down it&apos;s connection, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.</story>

    <story>The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning deals with Spyro&apos;s birth and his journey to meet his destiny. The intro shows Spyro being rescued by a Guardian Dragon called Ignitus from the attack of the Dark Master. After his eclosion, Spyro is raised by dragonflies in a swamp until one day he discovers that he is in fact a dragon, and he and his half-brother, the dragonfly Sparx, leave the swamp to find out more about Spyro&apos;s past and fight the forces of evil. In contrast to previous Spyro games the emphasis is put on combat instead of platforming. Spyro can do several combat moves, using both his tail and his claws, and has four different breath attacks: fire, electricity, ice and earth. The game also features several rail shooter passages similar to games like Panzer Dragoon.</story>

    <story>Long ago in the kingdom of Hyrule, an evil sorcerer began kidnapping young maidens. This sorcerer was known as Vaati, and it seemed that no one could stop him. Eventually an adventurer appeared who was able to defeat Vaati. This adventurer carried with him the four sword which caused him to be split into four beings, and by working together the four beings were able to seal Vaati deep within the earth. But now Vaati has escaped, and the task of defeating him again has fallen to Link! This action adventure game is played from a top down point of view. There are a variety of often maze-like lands to explore (some above ground and others below) as well as a variety of enemies to defeat. Since Link is now in possession of the four sword, there are four Links on the screen. In order to complete the various stages, the four Links will often need to work together in order to solve puzzles and defeat the many enemies. The four links are able to form several different formations, such as a line or square. The formations help the Links perform actions that couldn&apos;t be done by one, like moving heavy objects or defeating numerous enemies. At the beginning of each stage, the four sword will be weak in power; to replenish the swords power, force gems must be collected (which can be found hidden in various locations or by defeating enemies). At the end of each stage is a dark magic barrier, and the only way to destroy it is by a four sword which has been completely restored. The game can be played by one to four players, however there will always be four links on the screen. In multi-player games each player will control one of the Links and will need to connect with a Game Boy Advance which is used both to control the game as well is provide each player with their own display when their Link is inside a house or in a cavern. In addition to the adventure mode, a multi-player battle mode is included where four Links fight to see who wins.</story>

    <story>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time / Master Quest is a compilation disc containing the N64 classic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and the never-released 64DD Ura Zelda. Never sold at retail, the compilation was available as a pre-order bonus for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, sold with certain GameCube bundles, or made available through Nintendo of Europe&apos;s Stars Catalogue. Both games run at a higher resolution than the original versions, plus feature 480p Progressive Scan support and Dolby Surround. Master Quest is essentially the same game as Ocarina of Time. While the adventure unfolds in the same way (same enemies, items, characters), the difference lies in the dungeon layouts. Dungeons are remixed, meaning that item placement and room progression have been altered. So, even if you have already played Ocarina of Time, Master Quest offers a new take on a familiar setting. Also included on the compilation are video previews of various GameCube and GBA games. Included on the North American and European disc: 1. F-Zero GX 2. 1080° Avalanche 3. Wario World 4. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker 5. Metroid Prime 6. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past/Four Swords 7. ...and more</story>

    <story>Twilight Princess is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link&apos;s home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go wrong… The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks. The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. He can push blocks with his head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, he can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them. As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn&apos;t before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves. The art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.</story>

    <story>The Legos strike back in the sequel to the original LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, where players now get to explore the original trilogy of the Star Wars universe. LEGO Star Wars II is a game where players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO&apos;s, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart. LEGO Star Wars puts an original spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue. In this third-person platforming/action game, players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars. In Story Mode, players reenact the original movies with LEGOs. Each character has different weapons, like light-sabers for Jedi&apos;s, and crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers. Each character also has different abilities, like Jedi&apos;s being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jet pack. It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve puzzles and traverse the levels of the game. In addition to a single-player game, there is also a 2 player co-op mode that allows two players to play the Story Mode. In addition, there is also a Free-play mode that allows you to go back and play your beaten levels. For one, this allows you to go back and play the level with any character in the game that you have unlocked. However, a newly added feature allows you to create your own mixed up LEGO characters, and also allows you to create your own vehicles out of LEGO&apos;s. Power Brock items and coin stubs collected in Story Mode will also unlock new characters, vehicles, and items for you to play with.</story>

The game covers events in all three movies/books, mostly with references to major events shown through cut scenes, or the scenes from the movies with Ian McKellan&apos;s narration. A classic RPG game, The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age has gameplay elements similar to Final Fantasy, where you have a party of characters, each with a different set of skills and attributes, who gain levels, making them stronger as the game progresses. Battles are turn-based, and let the gamer make different decisions on what they want to do to change the outcome of the battle. The game travels through many areas throughout Tolkien&apos;s Middle Earth, including The Pelennor Fields and Moria.</story>

    <story>Unlike the Game Boy Advance version of the game, the console version of The Lord of the Rings:The Third Age introduces entirely new characters which aren&apos;t mentioned in the books or movies. The game does relate to the movies by including scenes from all three movies, with new background speech by Ian McKellen (Gandalf). There are seven playable characters in the game which have been created specifically for it, as well a small appearances by characters such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Eowyn, Faramir, and Gothmog. The game covers events in all three movies/books, mostly with references to major events shown through cut scenes, or the scenes from the movies with Ian McKellan&apos;s narration. A classic RPG game, The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age has gameplay elements similar to Final Fantasy, where you have a party of characters, each with a different set of skills and attributes, who gain levels, making them stronger as the game progresses. Battles are turn-based, and let the gamer make different decisions on what they want to do to change the outcome of the battle. The game travels through many areas throughout Tolkien&apos;s Middle Earth, including The Pelennor Fields and Moria.</story>

    <story>Electronic Arts&apos; first game based on the Lord of the Rings movies is an action game with classic beat&apos;em up-style gameplay. Despite the title, it covers events from both the first and the second film in the trilogy. Players, choosing to control Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, must battle the evil forces of the Dark Lord Sauron in order to protect the Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth. The player character moves through the levels, fighting hordes of Orcs, Goblins and other creatures with various attack and parrying moves. The more varied the attacks are and the less the player is hit, the more points are awarded for each kill. At the end of each level, kill points are accumulated and can be used to gain new abilities. Most of these are new attack moves, unleashed through various button combinations. Others increase health or upgrade the strength or speed of existing attacks. Each of the three characters has unique upgrades and moves. Several levels feature boss battles with the likes of the Watcher of Moria or Lurtz, leader of the Uruk-hai. Each boss requires a unique strategy to defeat. Most combat scenes from the movies have been turned into levels for the game: from the confrontation with the Ringwraiths at the Weathertop and the battle in the Mines of Moria from the first film to fights with Warg-riders and other enemies on the plains of Rohan from the second film. The game culminates in the defense of Helm&apos;s Deep, even though the depiction of the battle in the game differs considerably from that in the film. Between the levels, cutscenes tell the story. These scenes combine actual film footage with footage rendered with the game engine. The game offers lots of bonus content, some of which must be unlocked by completing missions or reaching certain levels with the characters. Featured are interviews with the filmmakers and actors (who also provide voices for the game) as well as various making-of features.</story>

What&apos;s weird, is he never entered any contest to begin with. Being the curious person he is, he calls up his brother, Mario, and asks to meet him at the house. Luigi sets forth through a dark and scary jungle to find the house, but sees that Mario is nowhere to be found. Puzzled, Luigi enters the mansion, only to encounter ghosts. He meets up with a scientist, Professor E. Gadd, who explains the situation and hands over the Poltergust 3000.

    <story>This new Mario Party has a twist. Along with the four-player party action that is expected with the board game like series, a new addition to the Mario Party team is the microphone. New mini-games included are now voice-activated, and using the microphone, you can command characters and play games like never before. Brighton (the sun) and Twila (the moon) constantly argue with each other over who is better. The debate creates a change in conditions during play, where it may be daytime at one point but suddenly change to nighttime. Depending on the time of day, mini-games will change, other characters will appear, and the board will modify in shape. The same four-player action is on-board with a ton of new and updated mini-games to play either during the party or by itself when unlocked. You can also play solo with the computer filling in the gaps. Along with collecting stars, there are also other objectives depending on the game board you choose, from which there are six varying types to choose.</story>

    <story>Mario and his friends need a break from fighting evil and saving the world; so they decided to go on a cruise! But Bowser showed up and is wrecking the good times; the only thing left to do is play a game of Mario Party! This is the seventh entry in the Mario Party Series and features similar gameplay. The game features a combination of a board game and mini games. The goal is to collect as many stars as possible as you make your way around the game board; after each turn, players compete in one of 86 mini games. The winner of the mini game earns coins which can be used to purchase the stars. Mini games can be played with players in teams, or every player for them self. In addition to the regular spaces, the game board also features several other types of spaces; some will begin a Bowser mini game, provide hidden bonuses, or allow you to purchase orbs to help slow down your opponents. Most of the mini games are played with the GameCube controller, and also included in the package is a microphone which is used for several voice activated mini games. The usual single player and multi player game modes are included. New in this release is the ability for up to eight players to compete! In the eight player game variation two players will need to share each of the controllers, each player controlling one of the analog sticks and a trigger.</story>

    <story>Mario and friends are challenged to play baseball with Bowser. So they play ball games with each other to decide who should play Bowser. The rules are the same as any other baseball game with some exceptions. Like other baseball games, each team gets three strikes, three outs, and four balls per inning. However, you can choose to play less than nine innings. You can also choose from Exhibition, Challenge, Toy Field, and Minigame modes. Exhibition mode is one game between two teams. In Challenge mode, you choose a team to play every other team; you can get the other teams characters by completing certain challenges. When you beat the other teams, you get a chance to play Bowser&apos;s team. In Toy Field mode, up to four players take turns to get the most points; players receive points by hitting the ball at certain spots, which consist of out, 1-, 2-, or 3-hits, or homerun spots. You can get a turn by catching the ball when your opponent hits the ball. At the start of Exhibition and Challenge modes, you choose your team captain. In Exhibition mode, you also choose team members, but in Challenge mode, your team members depend on which captain you pick. All the team captains have star pitches and star hits. The characters can also pitch fastballs and change-ups. You can unlock more characters through Challenge mode.</story>

    <story>The Twin Snakes is a remake of the 1998 Playstation tactical espionage action game Metal Gear Solid. You assume the role of a former member of a special military organization FOXHOUND, going by the codename Solid Snake. After the events described in the two Metal Gear games, Snake decided to retire and to live in solitude in Alaska. However, the US government needs him once again. A terrorist organization led by former FOXHOUND members threatens to fire a nuclear bomb if the government does not hand to them the remains of Big Boss, the legendary soldier who was once their commander. Solid Snake is sent to infiltrate the terrorists&apos; base, to rescue the scientists kept there, and to find a way to destroy the unknown nuclear weapon. There is another consideration that makes Solid Snake interested in the case: the leader of the terrorists bears the codename Liquid Snake and looks very similar to the special agent... The Twin Snakes has the same story and dialogues as the original (although voice-overs were re-recorded for this release). The locations in the game also remained the same, but the graphics were updated to look equal in quality to contemporary games. Gameplay was also enhanced, featuring the additions that first appeared in Metal Gear Solid 2. Snake can now roll, hang from ledges, hide in lockers, drag guards&apos; bodies away, as well as aim and shoot from first-person view. New weapons from Metal Gear Solid 2 (such as tranquilizer gun) are also present. Another noticeable change is in the game&apos;s cut scenes. Directed by the Japanese action movie director Ryuhei Kitamura, the cut scenes have a certain Matrix feel, featuring slow motion and other effects.</story>

    <story>Long ago, a bird-like race of creatures (called the Chozo) became extremely advanced technologically, but due to increasing violence in the universe, they began to hide and live more simple lives. The planet Tallon IV was the site of one of their colonies. Years later, a meteor crashed on Tallon IV releasing the strange element Phazon into the planet. Phazon poisoned anything it came in contact with, causing the plant and animal life to either die or mutate into a hideous form. The Chozo tried to control the power of Phazon but failed. Before abandoning the planet, they were able to cover the impact crater with a temple and seal Phazon into the planets core. Now space pirates have discovered Tallon IV, moving in to study Phazon and harnessing its power. They have also began rebuilding their fortress on planet Zebes and reviving the Mother Brain, Ridley, and Kraid, all of whom were destroyed by Samus Aran. However, Samus has tracked the space pirates to Tallon IV and must now enter the planet to destroy them once and for all before they have a chance to rebuild their destructive forces... Metroid Prime is a change from the platform-adventuring series, entering the first-person shooter genre for the first time. Players are now behind Samus Aran&apos;s visor and must use all their resources to investigate the pirate infestation of Tallon IV. Players can use Samus&apos;s beam, with missile and charge capabilities. Along the way, they must recover the bounty hunter&apos;s lost abilities like the morph ball and grapple beam, which allow them to reach unexplored areas of Tallon IV. Players must piece together the story of the fallen Chozo to figure what has happened to the poisoned planet, and prevent the pirates from using the Phazon to wreak havoc throughout the planets.</story>

    <story>A long time ago a race of beings called the Luminoth settled the planet Aether. They built energy controllers to harness the light of Aether to prolong the life of their planet and its inhabitants. After many ages of peace and prosperity, a meteor collided with the planet; this collision opened a dimensional rift into another world, called Dark Aether. From this world came an evil race of beings known as the Ing, and for many ages a war was fought between the Ing of the dark world and the Luminoth of the light world. Over time the Ing began winning, turning the light world to dark. At about this time, a federation spacecraft happens to be chasing a Space Pirate vessel, which is destroyed by the Ing, through the area. Wondering about the fate of this craft, the Galactic Federation sends an urgent message to Samus Aran, asking her to find the crew and investigate the planet Aether. This is the sequel to Metroid Prime where players once again control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she arrives on Aether. The game is played from both a first-person view(walking, running, jumping) and third-person view (morph ball mode and cut scenes). The game uses a combination of action, adventure, and platform game elements; while searching the player is able to uncover the story by finding federation reports and Luminoth lore. There are variety of puzzles to solve to reach new locations, different landscapes that the player can jump and grapple across and attack plenty of enemies. As usual, players begin the game with limited capabilities but additional weapons and suit upgrades can be found, including some standards from the Metroid series such as the varia suit, morph ball bombs, and missiles along with a few new weapons, such as the dark suit, dark beam, and light beam. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes also features multiplayer modes for up to four players. In deathmatch, combatants need to hunt down each of the other players. This variation can be played either with a time limit or where the greatest number of frags wins. The second option is called bounty mode; in this variation each player starts with a number of bounty coins. When one player hits another player with a powerful attack, some of their coins will drop, which can be collected. Coins may also be found throughout the landscape, and the player with the most coins at the end wins.</story>

    <story>Midway&apos;s first extreme sports title that tackles the great American past-time... baseball. Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude. Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play. So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme? The game is far from a real baseball simulation. This is as arcade as it gets. Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low. Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents. Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.</story>

    <story>The second title in Midway&apos;s baseball series, SlugFest 20-04 continues to pour on the rough-housing gameplay, bizarre codes, and humorous commentary. In addition to the new Home Run Derby mode and Create-A-Team options, the game features the ability of pitchers to catch On Fire and impossible Special Pitches that zigzag, arc, and whizz by in ways that would leave any batter humiliated. New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame. The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game. And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators&apos; booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.</story>

    <story>The house that old man Nebbercracker owns is alive and is swallowing whole anything that comes close to it. Three neighborhood kids DJ, Chowder, and Jenny decided to plan an attack on the house on Hallows&apos; Eve. There plans go array when police officers catch them attempting to break into the house and place the kids in the back of a police car. However, the house swallows the police officers and then swallows the police car holding the children. Now that the children are in the belly of the beast, they have to find a way to put a stop to this monster house. In Monster House players have to explore the house while taking on the role of the three children (the game will automatically switch to a different character as the story calls for it). Each child is armed with a water blaster and a melee attack to take out enemies. The water blasters reservoir will get drained each time it&apos;s fired and will require an occasional re-pumping to refill it. Also, each child has a unique limited ammo weapon, DJ has an instant camera which can stun enemies with its flash, Jenny has a slingshot which shoots marbles, and Chowder has water balloons to soak enemies. Players can find items like keys to unlock doors, cans of pop to regain health, and arcade tokens which can then be used to play a mini-game called Thou Art Dead, a side-scolling action game. The various bathrooms found through out the house are safe zones and will allow the player to save their game. Also, finding toy monkeys scattered through out the house will unlock game art which can be viewed in the game&apos;s Gallery mode.</story>

    <story>Mr. Driller and his friends are invited to the opening of Drill Land, a theme park with five different attractions. Mr. Driller and the rest of the crew set out to explore the unique drill-themed attractions and complete them, to earn a stamp from each one. Mr. Driller: Drill Land is a sequel to Mr. Driller. The basic goal is like the original - players must dig through from top to bottom, aiming to reach the goal depth in meters. As they dig, they gradually lose air, so they must also collect air capsules to replenish their air and prevent losing a life. However, Drill Land has five different attractions, each with its own unique take on the Mr. Driller formula: 1. The Hole of Druaga - An obvious homage to the Namco game The Tower of Druaga, The Hole of Druaga has Anna Hottenmeyer digging through a block filled castle, encountering enemies such as slimes, knights and wizards. Anna must find and defeat the dragon that is guarding the key to the exit, and then make it to the exit to battle the final boss. 2. World Drill Tour - The standard Mr. Driller mode of play. Dig your way through to the set depth, using any character that you like. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses. 3. Star Driller - A spaced themed stage where you play as Susumu. Dig through the blocks, and make your way to the set depth. Star blocks are power-ups that can either help (such as a barrier for an extra hit) or hinder (like a black hole that sucks all the blocks away close to you). 4. Drindy Adventure - This stage stars Taizo from the original Dig Dug, in an Indiana Jones-like setting. Taizo does not require air in this mode, and his goal is to collect a set amount of gold statues. In his way are traps like rolling boulders, spikes, and flames. 5. Horror Night House - A ghost-themed stage featuring Ataru as a ghost hunter. Your goal is to kill ghosts by first collecting holy water to fill your syringe-like drill, and then wait for ghosts to get close to you, and inject the nearby bricks with holy water to stun them. While the ghosts are stunned, you can break the bricks to finish them off. Mr. Driller: Drill Land also features two multiplayer modes: Race and Battle. Race has each player trying to be the first to reach the set depth. Battle has everyone on the same screen, attempting to collect the gold coin. It takes three gold coins to win.</story>

This game follows the pattern of most party games, like Mario Party, for example, in that your overall goal is to win a board game. To win the board game, you must succeed at a variety of mini games, which may include a wide variety of gameplay styles. Winning a mini game earns you a party favor of a certain color. The ultimate goal is to accumulate the most party favors to win. Party favors you win can then be used to unlock additional mini games and bonus videos. If you unlock enough mini games, you can then unlock a new game board in the main game. You can choose to play as Gonzo, Animal, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Pepe, or Fonzie. In addition, a lot of other Muppet characters have cameo appearances.</story>

    <story>Mystic Heroes is a fighting game loosely based on the novel Fengshen Yanyi (16th century). The player takes the role of a hero who fights against the evil ex-emperor Kang and his magical army. The gameplay itself is simple: the player wades through enemy hordes and kills them all. He has the choice between eight characters which all have different advantages and disadvantages - but basically the player chooses between sword and magical attacks. He can also use combo attacks. During the course of the game the player can find magical runes which give him additional magical abilities and power-ups, e.g. health and mana refreshments or temporary and permanent improvements to the attacking and defending statistics. In fact some of these runes have to be earned by completing the story mode multiple times - the player can use the same character for his and gets to keep his abilities and statistics. Mana also replenishes with every defeated foe. Besides the story there is also a Survival mode.</story>

It features characters from the franchise such as Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, plus others making for a roster of eight selectable fighters. Each fighter has basic punches and kicks, throws, and a character specific special move in their arsenal. A special ability becomes usable after a fighter&apos;s Chakra Meter is filled all the way, which is done by either receiving or inflicting damage. Fighters can also perform a teleport type move but performing it will cost the fighter some of their energy. The game has several modes such as a Story mode, with interspersing cutscenes between fights, a two player battle mode, a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a training mode. The game&apos;s extras include a gallery, character profiles, and a sound test. Fights take place at varying locales such as the academy&apos;s </story>

Seeing as the show centers on students at a Ninja Academy, the translation to a 2D fighting game seems logical. Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 will introduce some new characters, such as a female ninja named Temari and the hardened ninja master Jiraiva. There’s also a chubby character named Chouji. As in the show, Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 splits characters into groups of three. Returning characters Ino and Shikamaru join newcomer Chouji in Team Konoha, while Team Sand is made up of newbie Temari and old characters Kankuro and Gaara. As in the last installment, Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 boasts a four-player fighting mode.</story>

It covers the events from the Return of Itachi arc to the Sasuke Retrieval arc. The game also introduces the ability for multiple characters to fight one another at once, ranging from a 2-on-2 match to a 4-way brawl. Most noticeably, the game does away with the shop feature, and unlockables are now acquired by simply meeting certain criteria in the game&apos;s new Mission mode. Mission mode forces the player to fight increasingly stronger opponents under specific circumstances and with different methods of winning in order to complete each mission.

    <story>NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup marks a change in name for the series, but continues the style of gameplay and game modes from the NASCAR Thunder titles. Four new racing series have been added for this year; in addition to NEXTEL cup cars, players can race in the Featherlite Modified, Craftsman Truck, Nascar National (Busch), or production car series. Each type of car has its own unique feel and gives a different on-track experience. Real-life driver rivalries and confrontations are brought into the game with the enhanced grudges and alliances system. Computer drivers will remember whether you drive naughty or nice, and will payback favors in kind. The new Intimidator feature allows you to shake up an opponent by getting behind him and putting on the pressure. In fight to the top mode, players can follow the career of their driver by starting in the Modified series and working their way up the NASCAR ranks. Performing well in races, as well as participating in autograph sessions, affects fan support, which in turn improves the driver&apos;s income. Online support for the PS2 and Xbox allow up to four players to compete in a full 43-car field.</story>

You can also play a skirmish with a friend, go out for a two-on-two game, or one of many other play modes you would expect in a competitive basketball game. Just don&apos;t play it like the NBA... the college game has a different, more team-oriented feel, and this comes through in the gameplay.</story>

    <story>The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle. Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year&apos;s edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race. The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total. The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.</story>

    <story>The Need for Speed series returns, this time reverting back to the &apos;chase&apos; arcade experience instead of a racing simulation. Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops. Choose from a selection of today&apos;s (and yesterday&apos;s) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more. The competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks. The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</story>

    <story>Need for Speed Most Wanted is in fact a cross between the Underground and the Hot Pursuit spin-offs. The player must gain notoriety by racing in the streets and attracting the attention of the cops in order to ascend in the Black List of illegal racers. In the end he must face no.1, Razor who tricked him out of his own car and used it to get to the top. Many racing modes are carried on from NFSU2 with the addition of Milestones, special events where the driver must evade capture and/or disable police cars by bringing down Pursuit Breakers, specially marked buildings such as gas stations and water towers. For each one of the 15 Blacklisted opponents, the player must win a specific number of events from each of the two main types and gain enough notoriety in the process. The player can invest bet money to buy new cars or improve his existing one&apos;s looks and performance so that he remains competitive. In Most Wanted, Josie Maran replaces Brooke Burke as the racer girl. The plot is furthered through use of FMV video with live actors and digital sets, which has been heavily enhanced so that it looks quite real.</story>

    <story>NFL Blitz Pro is the 2003 entry in Midway&apos;s arcade football series. Like NHL Hitz Pro however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can catch on fire. The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays. Game modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates. The game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games. Available for purchase are fantasy teams and stadiums, and new game modes: in Butterfingaz mode, every hit leads to a fumble, while Cyberleague features robot teams and an exploding ball. Also available is the customary Big Head mode, among several others. Old-school Blitz series arcade gameplay is available in Blitz Classic mode.</story>

    <story>NFL Street 2 is the second game in EA&apos;s arcade football series. Players try to become the world&apos;s best urban footballer by conquering other teams using several gravity-defying tricks like up-the-wall passes, off-the-wall catches, and highlight-reel wall jukes. Like the other games in the Street franchise, the game is played with a small amount of players and a focus on arcade gameplay. Unlike the first game, the walls can now be used for run-up passes and receptions, or bonuses by aiming for posters and hotspots. There are twelve arenas to compete in (2 unlockable) and the players are licensed from the 2004 NFL rosters. Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends. Progress is based on milestones where you sharpen specific skills to reach the top or beat sufficient teams. When five days are left, the team enters a final tournament. Another one is the new Own the City mode, where the player create a new character and has to win all street games in the city. New players need to be recruited from pick-up games. The final team to beat consists of rapper Xzibit and a team of NFL stars. Characters created in this mode can be imported into the NFL Challenge, but also in Madden NFL 06. The PSP version is a faithful port, with some of the cut scenes removed, and 3 new street modes added for Wi-Fi multiplayer: Street Slalom (an obstacle course), Style Point Challenge, and Style Standoff, a end zone dance contest, similar to Space Channel 5, next to the regular multiplayer modes. Up to four players can play on a single PSP in the Party Play game modes such as the 2 Minute Challenge and Jump Ball Challenge.</story>

    <story>New rules and updated rosters and season schedules feature in this update of the longrunning NHL series, as do many new features. Deking is now performed using the left analog stick, with swift signature moves of star players that confuse opponents and reward skill. The same stick is used to increase the accuracy when shooting. While preparing for a shot, a bull&apos;s-eye appears in the enemy goal and you can quickly move the target to the corners for precision. To add to the individual qualities, statistics such as speed and size are now reflected during gameplay in the players&apos; momentum and turning radius. To get past opponents quickly, you can generate momentum for quick speed boosts. With the introduction of R.P.M. (Realistic Puck Momentum) dynamics, there is more randomness with the puck, as a shot off the mask can now stun goalies. Another small addition is the deformation of the ice during the match. In the player creation mode, where you can now apply bruises, broken noses, black eyes and scars to your players, the thumbstick is used for face sculpting - changing the different features. All the regular game modes are present, of which the Dynasty Mode from the previous version is the most complete, with scouting and full management options, inside and outside the arena. Contrary to the last game, you can now intervene during simulated AI games and win the match for your team. The PC, PS2 and Xbox version support online multiplayer games, and as a special bonus, the original NHL 94 game, one of the first in the series, has been included with the PS2 edition.</story>

The control for NHL 2004 has been refined, allowing for more precise movement than in the previous games. Precise passes, shots, and accurate skating are accomplished by simply tapping the button. NHL 2004 features a new fighting engine, allowing for more accurate and realistic fights. The right analog stick controls Bruise Control, which lets you perform different moves by tilting the stick in different directions. Before you get into fights, you&apos;ll need to agitate a player, and this is where his Agitation Meter comes in. Losing the game, being checked, making sloppy passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight at the slightest poke check. NHL 2004 contains the EA Sports Bio, which is a feature found on all console versions of EA Sports game. Playing more EA Sports titles, playing them for a long time, and winning special accomplishments (such as your first shutout in NHL 2004 or your first number one finish in NASCAR Thunder 2004) will earn you a higher Gamer Level, and will reward you with bonuses, such as cheat codes and new stadiums. This feature isn&apos;t found on the PC version. In addition to the standard roster of NHL teams, there are thirty nine international teams for you to choose from, such as Germany&apos;s DEL or Sweden&apos;s Elitserien, plus the usual U.S.A., Canada, and other regulars. The PlayStation version of NHL 2004 supports online play.</story>

    <story>This game uses the same three-on-three style that debuted in Hitz 2002. The 2003 installment has larger rinks, bigger crowds, a referee, and animated coaches. All 30 NHL teams are represented with motion-capture animation, and you can build your own players with the Create-Player option. The game&apos;s Season mode now allows for trades, stat tracking, and player awards. Up to four players can play each other in exhibition mode. Season mode puts you into a standard NHL schedule, but you can change to a shorter season if you want. There is also a small numer of hockey-related minigames, such as keep-away. Franchise mode is where you pick and name your team, name your players, and play against other teams to earn experience points. Those points can be used to upgrade your players in categories such as toughness, speed, passing, and agility. After beating all the lesser teams in a tier, you can move on to battle a boss team for that region. Beating that team nets you some new equipment for your players, which also improves their stats.</story>

    <story>NHL Hitz Pro is Midway&apos;s 2003/2004 entry into the licensed hockey market. For the 2004 sports season, Midway introduced a directive to move their sports titles away from over-the-top arcade-style gameplay, and introduce a more sim-like approach to sports. For NHL Hitz Pro, this meant moving away from 3-on-3 hockey to 5-on-5 hockey gameplay to make the game more authentic for the demands of the sim hockey player. While NHL Hitz Pro still maintains many of the arcade-style elements that were a signature feature of the Hitz series such as checks over the boards and hits through glass, the gameplay has been tuned to provide an experience that is accurate to the sport of hockey. That being said, the player has extensive options for tuning the gameplay for either a fast-paced arcade experience, or a slower, more sim-like style of play. As with competing titles, Hitz Pro supports a franchise mode, season and exhibition gameplay and a game tutorial/practice mode. The title also sports a pickup hockey mode with several environments that are reminiscent of playing hockey in outdoor venues.</story>

    <story>Odama is a quirky pinball title set in ancient Japan. You are in control of a giant steel ball, called the Odama, which you use to crush the enemy army (and hopefully not your own soldiers) so that you have an easier time leading the Ninten Bell to its destination. The game also takes of advantage of the GCN microphone (included with most versions of the game), which you use to command your troops. You must use the commands and pinball skills to successfully lead the Ninten Bell to its destination before sunset in each mission. Using the L+R buttons to control the flippers, the X button to activate the microphone, and the control stick to tilt the battlefield, the controls in Odama are quite simple for today&apos;s standards. In each mission, you, representing the Yamanouchi clan, try to bring the clan&apos;s powerful treasure, the Ninten Bell, as well as the Odama, closer to the Karasuma Keep, headed by the man who betrayed the founder of the Yamanouchi clan. It is there you will exact revenge for his betrayal. Notably, the game features a narrator that talks about the story in Japanese, but there are English subtitles. The basic goal of each mission is to guide the bell from the bottom to the top of the screen, mowing down the members of the opposing army with the Odama, as well as killing them with your own soldiers. It is important that they are killed because, if they reach your side of the screen, they will make the flippers inactive for a relatively long period of time. When all Odamas are lost or the sun sets, you fail the mission. In addition, you learn commands for your soldiers as you progress through the game. Using these commands, you&apos;ll be able to more effectively control your soldiers in many ways. For example, by saying, press forward, your troops will use all of their strength to try and plow through enemy soldiers. These commands are not only very useful, but in many cases, are vital to your success. However, use of certain commands and reckless use of the Odama drains your Morale Bar. When this bar is low, your troops will stop responding to your commands, which can and will be disastrous to your mission. There are also items that the Odama can pick up along the way to aid you. Most notably is one that allows the Odama to convert all members of the opposing army over to yours when it rolls them over. In merging all of these elements, Odama is a very fast, difficult, and frenzied title. Although it is a pinball game at its core, the voice commands, power-ups, and storyline throw it into a league of its own.</story>

    <story>One Piece: Grand Battle is based on the Japanese anime of the same name and is actually the fourth game in the Grand Battle series. This installment features cel shaded graphics, 14 characters in total – 5 playable and 9 that you have to unlock – and has 5 modes for you to play and 2 others where you can view unlocked art of the characters. The Grand Battle mode is where you can fight against human players or CPU players and has most of the characters unlocked from the beginning. Story Mode is where you’ll spend most of your time since this is where you can unlock the rest of your characters and other staff like screenshots of the anime. Mini Games, as the name implies is a mode for playing mini games. Usopp Pirates challenge you to a series of 3 mini games. You begin by selecting three players for your team and each time you win a game you can select a member of the team that lost. Of course the opposite can also happen if you lose a game. Grand Tourney is a multiplayer battle tournament where you can set up to 16 human or CPU players to compete. I believe Training mode is pretty much self explanatory. And there are also 2 other modes – Treasure and One Piece Art. Basically this is where you can find all the staff you have unlocked like character endings, costume art and staff like that. Characters have basically the same button presses to perform attacks. Other than that each one has a support character that he can call to aid in the battle and 2 different unique attacks that can be used if certain conditions are met. There is also another unique attack for each character, with a long animated sequence that if you use when low on energy the enemy can be defeated with only one blow.</story>

Players can choose for the six following characters: Pac-Man (from Pac-Man), Ms. Pac-Man (from Ms. Pac-Man), Heihachi Mishima (from Tekken), Tiger Jackson (from Tekken), Astaroth (from Soul Calibur), and Reiko (from Ridge Racer). Gameplay is similar to Nintendo&apos;s Mario Party, in which each player competes in a set of mini-games to advance around the board of three various worlds (Medieval, Space and Tropical). Players set the length of the game (short, medium, long), and play in rounds. Each round begins with a mini-game which determines how far a player can move on the board. Each tile on the board enables players to move forward or go backward, lose, gain, or steal tokens, play a single or two-player mini-game, spend earned tokens, or a raffle game to earn redemption tickets. With Store tiles, players can spend tokens to move forward, move other players backward, buy raffle tickets, or gamble for more tokens. Once a player reaches the end of the board, players receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can be used to buy each mini-game separately for tournament play outside the game. Once all the mini-games have been purchased, players can add up all of their tickets to total up their overall high score.</story>

    <story>Pac Man is back this time under the direction of famous Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto (The man behind Zelda, Mario etc.) In this game one person plays as the famous Pac Man while the other players take the role of the ghosts desperately trying to stop the yellow menace from eating his way to a predetermined score. Now the twist is Pac Man sees the game from the classic Pac Man view on the Game Boy Advance while to ghosts each have a limited view of the area in 3D on the television screen. Teamwork becomes vital as they try to hunt down Pac Man, the ghost who eats Pac Man then gets the Game Boy Advance and tries his luck as the hunted. If Four players are not available computers will act as any ghost not directly controlled by a player. Computer ghost can not hurt Pac Man unless they have been touched by a human controlled ghost. Which ever human player touches them first will get control of the game boy if the computer catches Pac Man.</story>

    <story>Long ago, an evil stronger then anything before or after it, was trapped underneath a tree, which grew the five golden fruits. Years later the band of ghosts, who continue to roam Pac-World, have stolen the fruits from the tree. Unknown to them, they have also unleashed the evil that lurked beneath the tree on a helpless Pac-World. Only one Pac can return the five golden fruits to the tree and stop both the ghosts and the new evil from destroying Pac-World, and that&apos;s Pac-Man. Using his famous munching skills, Pac-Man must explore 20 monster, pit and trap filled levels. But of course, the Pac-Pills can be found across each map to aid Pac-Man in his quest.

The game is packed with not only the traditional Dots to consume and enemies to avoid, but also with power-ups and temporary advantages which players should use strategically to win the race and beat opponents. One example is a power slide to turn corners at full speed. Of course, enemies can also be bitten after eating a Power Pellet.</story>

This is where the title the thousand-year door comes from. It&apos;s not known what could be behind this door, but everyone has different theories. Princess Peach finds a map and mails the map and a letter stating that Mario must come. So Mario comes to place called Rogueport where Peach was last seen. There he meets a female goomba named Goombella. Mario shows the map to Goombella. Goombella then takes Mario to her archeology professor. The professor decides to take Mario to the thousand-year door. When Mario stands in front of the door, the map begins to show the locations of stars which open the door. The adventure begins from this point. Mario can jump, run, hammer, talk to people, etc.. Mario finds many partners on his quest. Battles play out on a stage in front of an audience. In battle, Mario must keep his fans happy by executing action commands (hitting buttons at the right time during his attacks). Occasionally, in battle, the crowd will throw things at Mario. The player can attack the crowd at this time.</story>

Called C.A.R.D. technology, any Hunter can carry a simple deck of cards that represent the various weapons available. This new discovery leads to the colonization of Ragol 2 and the birth of a new faction (calling themselves the Arkz) who oppose the government&apos;s actions. You can choose either side, the Arkz or Heroes, which both determines the abilities and cards available to you and the strategy decisions you must make in battle. The Heroes are the stronger of the two at first, with various weapons available to them, while the Arkz can summon creatures to their aid. Gameplay is similar to Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh, using the power and abilities of each card in turn to defeat the enemy.

    <story>Piglet is Christopher Robin&apos;s shy and squeamish friend in the children&apos;s Winnie the Pooh stories. Also loosely based on Piglet&apos;s Big Movie, this version of Piglet&apos;s Big Game has a different story and objectives than the PC/Mac version released separately. Each character is voiced by the original actors from the movie. This is a single player adventure game with action elements. In the Hundred-Acre-Wood, Pooh, Eeyore, Roo, Owl, Rabbit and Tigger are going about their normal activities when Piglet sees a scary Granosorus, which disappears before anyone else can see it. When Piglet tries to warn his friends, they don&apos;t believe him. Christopher Robin tells Piglet to overcome his fears, but Piglet thinks that he will never be big and brave enough. As his friends start to fall asleep, Piglet leaves the woods and finds a magical telescope which allows him to jump into the dreams his friends are having during their naps. In each of the 6 dream levels, Piglet must help his friends with problems and puzzles. For example, help Pooh find honey or Tigger find his stripes. Each dreamworld is also dangerous with menacing Heffalumps and Woozles, among other scary monsters. Piglet must defeat these monsters with a tactic he knows well - making scary faces. Some monsters aren&apos;t frightened enough, though, so use cookies (hidden in the scenery) to buy some scarier ones at the Brave Face Factory. Find and use Christopher Robin&apos;s balloon which gives Piglet a morale boost and a burst of speed. Depending upon the scenario, three characters can be controlled: Piglet, Tigger and Winnie the Pooh. After the 6 nightmare levels are solved, Piglet will face the real Granosorus from the beginning of the game and become a hero by rescuing his friends.</story>

There are several different varieties of Pikmin, each a different color and with varying abilities (red Pikmin are immune to fire, blue Pikmin can swim, yellow Pikmin can be thrown far, purple Pikmin are stronger, and white Pikmin are small and fast).

    <story>The story of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time starts with the Prince and his father, the King of Persia, besieging the Maharajah&apos;s castle to plunder the treasures hidden inside. In order to impress his father, the Prince sneaks inside to recover the magical Dagger of Time. He quickly learns that this dagger has the ability to control time. The malevolent Vizier has other plans for the dagger, however, and tricks the Prince into unlocking a mysterious secret of the Dagger that causes the King and many of his subjects to be turned into sand zombies. Now, the Prince must figure out what has happened and try to set things right again. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action adventure game that updates many of the gameplay concepts from the original two games and brings them into a fully 3-dimensional world. The Prince will engage in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more in his quest. The Prince also carries the Dagger of Time, which allows him to unleash several magical powers. The most important of these powers is the ability to reverse time. This ability allows the player to reverse their actions when they lead the Prince to his death.</story>

    <story>After many dangerous adventures, the Prince finally makes his way home to Babylon, bringing with him his new bride Kaileena, the Empress of Time. Their hopes for a peaceful and happy future together are dashed, however, when they arrive in Persia to find the land ravaged by war. Kaileena is promptly captured and murdered by the evil Vizier, and her death unleashes the Sands of Time, from which the Vizier derives terrifying new powers. Once again the Prince of Persia must stand to fight, but this time he will be stronger than ever, thanks to his new alter ego the Dark Prince, borne of the Prince&apos;s contact with the Sands. As he fights to reclaim his kingdom from the hands of a madman, he must also battle with his own inner demons as the Dark Prince threatens to consume him entirely. The game is very similar (in terms of fight and puzzle sequences) to the previous installments of UbiSoft&apos;s Prince of Persia trilogy: The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. There are some major innovations like the character of Dark Prince, who possess the main protagonist from time to time and offers him new combos and moves. There is also new ability, called Speed Kill, which is very effective against all opponents in the game (victims are attacked from behind and murdered in brutally fashion). In Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones player will explore not only the streets of Babylon, but also a ruined palace of his father, temple and the famous Hanging Gardens.</story>

    <story>Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is the direct sequel to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The game comes with a new, darker look for the Prince and his surroundings. The fights are more brutal and take a larger part in the game, as the Prince now has enhanced fighting moves including new attack moves via walls and poles. Even though the fights make up a large part of the game, the puzzle sections are still present and more complicated than before. A new move in the puzzle sections of the game is the curtain slide, which allows you to slide down to the ground slowly. There are still plenty of options for time manipulation and the storyline also lets you travel back and forth in time, visiting the same locations in an alternate time period.</story>

    <story>Scum Labs is testing a new drink called &apos;Scum Soda&apos;. However, all thirty test subjects that drank it have transformed into angry, hulking monsters! Most of the monsters have been contained in cryo-tubes and hidden within various cities. However, some monsters, such as George, Lizzie and Ralph, are still free! It&apos;s up to you to tear down cities and find the hidden monsters. Rampage: Total Destruction is an update to the arcade game Rampage. In it, you play as one of thirty furious monsters as you make your way through cities, destroying buildings and eating people for health. Destroying buildings builds up your Rampage Meter - when this is full, you&apos;ll become super-powered for a while, and be able to destroy things much more quickly. Each level also has a bonus challenge - such as &apos;Eat ten mimes&apos; or &apos;Destroy five trams&apos;. If you complete this challenge, your monster will receive a permanent upgrade, such as a roar attack, or a charge punch. At the tenth level of each city, players face off against a boss character, Dr. Vector - if you destroy his dangerous machines as well as levelling the city, you&apos;ll receive a bonus. A new feature of Rampage: Total Destruction is the ability to climb on the front of buildings. Instead of just climbing the sides and standing on the top of buildings, players can now smash the buildings from the front as well. However, there is an added danger to this - people now hurl objects like televisions out their windows in an attempt to try and stop you. The game also includes two previous games from the series as a bonus - the original Rampage, and Rampage World Tour. These games are emulations of the arcade versions of the game.</story>

    <story>Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world into a deadly possibility. By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It&apos;s up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox. Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman&apos;s main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the &amp;quot;shoot&amp;quot; button. The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment. Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level. Rayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman&apos;s health bar. There are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games. The Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.</story>

Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire&apos;s ordeals. Code: Veronica continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, Code: Veronica is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds, using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles, showing protagonist, monsters and rooms from different spooky viewpoints. Most of the weapons from the earlier games make return appearances: knife, handguns, shotgun, grenade launcher and crossbow are all featured. There are also new weapons including a sniper rifle, an AK-47 and several guns only found in pairs, which can be used to target two enemies at the same time. Several weapons upgrades can also be found. Similar to the earlier games, the player will not only control Claire, but also two other characters: Claire&apos;s fellow prisoner Steve, and her brother Chris.</story>

    <story>Special forces S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team&apos;s helicopter malfunctioned and crashed during their mission, disappearing into the Arklay Mountains. This and what happens to them is told in the story of Resident Evil Zero. Now, S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is sent on a mission to investigate a series of murders around Raccoon Forest. Spotting the Bravo team&apos;s helicopter, or what&apos;s left of it, they land nearby and investigate the surrounding area. Unaware of what they might expect, one member is attacked and devoured by zombified dobermans. The rest of the team, with a little bit of luck, find shelter in a nearby mansion, not knowing it was probably better to stay out. You play the entire game with one of the two selectable characters, Chris Redfield, or Jill Valentine. The starting point is the lobby of the mansion the three surviving S.T.A.R.S. members just stepped in. After a short while, the team decides to split and search for any possible survivors or anything useful that may help them break out of this dreadful place. To their amazement, they encountered an enemy they never were trained to confront, zombies. There is only one mission to be considered now: survival. The game is largely a remake of the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation, with some additions. While the floorplan of the returning locations is almost entirely unchanged, several new areas have been added in, extending your stay in the mansion. A new enemy, Lisa, has been added to the game, making your trips outside of the mansion much more dangerous. Finally killing a zombie is now no longer good enough to put them to rest. They must be destroyed totally with fire or else they will rise again; faster, deadlier, and madder than before.</story>

    <story>Even though Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were able to destroy the Umbrella corporation&apos;s undead monsters in the original Resident Evil, Umbrella&apos;s experiments with the T-virus continued unhindered. Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris, and Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop on his first day of the job, arrive in the sleepy midwestern town of Raccoon City only to find the city in flaming ruins due to the inhabitants having been transformed into mindless flesh-eating freaks. Although Claire and Leon team up, they are soon separated and trapped inside the city by a car crash. Seeking refuge within the Raccoon City police station, each character must find a way to escape from the nightmare while solving the mystery of what happened to Raccoon City. Besides the zombie population (which is much more diverse than the original, including teenage girl zombies, maniac cop zombies, and even melting naked zombies), Claire and Leon will also have to deal with a variety of freakish mutants including giant poisonous spiders, walking venus-fly-traps, and speedy wall-crawling Lickers. Each character will also be pursued by one seemingly unstoppable foe: a horrific and constantly evolving man-monster known as the G-Type (Leon&apos;s Scenario) , or a taciturn but inhumanly powerful Umbrella agent who is nonetheless saddled with the rather quaint name of Mr. X (Claire&apos;s Scenario). Like the previous game in the series, Resident Evil 2 is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Just like the original Resident Evil, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters. Each character goes through the same initial scenario, but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way. Leon will team up with a mysterious woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. Unlike the original Resident Evil, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn&apos;t choose, with new locations, maps, enemies, a longer and more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren&apos;t given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.</story>

    <story>So Evil they even gave it a subtitle! The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill master of unlocking Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you&apos;ll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group&apos;s last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill. A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we&apos;ve come to know and... well, know from Umbrella&apos;s ultimate bio-weapons. Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill&apos;s ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse. The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation. The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill&apos;s possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.</story>

    <story>Picking up six years after Resident Evil 2, the fourth game in the series follows former cop (now US agent) Leon S. Kennedy to Europe on a top secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president&apos;s daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president&apos;s daughter. Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new behind the back movement camera angle and an over the shoulder aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous merchant to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG. The game also includes a mode called Separate Ways (which is not included on the original GameCube release and was added to later platforms only) similar to Resident Evil 2&apos;s game A/B system, where the player must play the game through the eyes of Ada Wong. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as character such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself.</story>

You take on the role as one of two characters; Rebecca Chambers, the Bravo team medic that was encountered in the first game, and Billy Coen, an ex-con being transported. The game begins with a video of Bravo team flying overhead, en route to investigate a series of murders. Something happens, and the helicopter crashes. Everyone survives, but when they all start searching, they encounter an overturned military transport truck, with nothing but corpses inside. Rebecca Chambers, the youngest member of S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team, goes to investigate the Umbrella Company Luxury Train, which has mysteriously stalled in the middle of the woods. You now take control of Rebecca, and your journey begins. RE:0 features an all-new storyline, which takes place before the events of the first game. You will learn some background information, as well as a wealth of new information. The game also introduces what it calls a &amp;quot;partner zapping&amp;quot; system, which allows you to switch between Rebecca and Billy at any time. This feature must be used at times, as the game requires both characters to work together to solve some puzzles. New to the game are a bunch of terrifying enemies, like the mutant centipede, new areas to explore, and the ability to drop items on the ground instead of having to find an item box.</story>

    <story>Robocop places you in the titanium-coated-with-kevlar boots of Alex Murphy, killed in the line of duty and resurrected as the cyborg officer Robocop. The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug Brain Drain, and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP&apos;s role in all this is almost certain, but unclear. Robocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons. Objectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy&apos;s pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop&apos;s ethics and prime directives.</story>

The player takes the role of Jack Archer, an ace Veritech pilot in the SDF. His missions range from hunting down and destroying Zentraedi Lieutenants in destroyed cities to defending shuttles traveling through deep space wreckage fields. Characters from the show, voiced by the same actors who did the voices in the Robotech cartoon, will make cameo appearances throughout the game. As the game progresses Jack will gain access to new Veritech models, which have different stats but mostly the same abilities. In Fighter mode the Veritech can fire a rapid fire Gunpod bullets or homing missiles as well as drop a decoy pod that will attract enemy missiles. Guardian mode is slower than Fighter mode and loses the ability to drop decoy pods, but can aim Gunpod bullets, gains more powerful missiles, and can pick up mission critical items. Battloid mode can not fly or fire missiles, but can rapidly aim the Gunpod and automatically shoot down enemy missiles. Battloid can also go into sniper mode and hit enemies at a distance with a very powerful charged Gunpod shot. Each mode can be switched between instantly and whenever desired. Medals are awarded for achieving milestones in the game, such as shooting down enemy units or winning boss battles, and these can unlock new Veritech models, paint jobs, and arenas for two-player mode.</story>

Leon is transported to weird dimension during his experiments where the evil Looger and his cohorts steal the portal travel technology and uses it to break into our world to perfect the technology. Once here, they are discovered by Bobby who is captured and questioned about Leon’s work. Bobby manages to escape and is teleported to their world where the story takes place. Scaler is an action platform game in which you control Bobby Jenkins who turns to Scaler in the “bizarre dimension” and tries to stop the evil Looger and his cronies. Along your adventure you will come across friends and foes like Leon who gives you advice and guidance and “Captain Bootcamp” who is Looger’s right hand lackey. Travel through 15 colorful levels riding vines and crawling walls as you hunt and defeat Looger and his team. Scaler has lots of abilities like climbing walls to reach new areas and riding vines to charge up your electric bomb attack. Use camouflage to sneak by deadly traps and confuse your enemies. Attack with your tongue or use your claw attack, which you can upgrade during the game. Use the Electric Bomb attack several enemies at once. Scaler can transform into some of the enemies he defeats after defeating enough of them and use the special abilities of that creature. Break open cocoons and shells to collect Klokkies and Crystal Gems which in turn can be used to get new abilities and upgrade existing ones. If you collect 100 Crystal Gems in the game you will get an alternate ending. Collect Lizard Eggs to unlock more levels and to keep Looger form mutating them into monsters. The intuitive menu system lets you set options like camera view (first or third) and rotation (normal or inverted), audio and vibration. The pause menu lets you save your game, see your objectives and the ones you have finished, check your status screen (number of collectables you have, energy points earned, number of transformable creatures you have defeated, transformations you have mastered and abilities you have learned), display current level map and see a world map and a picture gallery. As you collect more Crystal Gems more pictures will become available.</story>

    <story>Fred brings the rest of Mystery, Inc. along to meet his cousin, Jed, who works at the Monstrous Fright &amp; Magic. MFM is a special effects company that creates monster costumes with a special formula they invented called, “Mubber”, that makes the costumes seems so real that the wearer literally becomes the actual monster. When they arrive, they found the location in shambles. Winslow Stanton, the creator of Mubber and owner of MFM, told them someone has stolen the Mubber formula and by using it with their animatrons, destroyed the building and disappeared. He believes it is Jed’s doing because he, too, disappeared. Looks like it’s up to Scooby and the gang to find Jed, destroy the costumed monsters and unmask the truth behind this great mystery! In Scooby-Doo! Unmasked, you will guide Scooby to help Mystery, Inc. uncover clues, fight monsters and occasionally save your friends from danger. You will be visiting many several worlds including a China Town and a museum. You will encounter various monsters like the Chinese Zombie and the Black Knight and the only way to get past them is by attacking them with your spin, slide, roll and smash attacks! Also, by collecting mubbers, you can create special costumes that will give you special powers. For example, with the Kung Fu Costume, you will be able to move around with greater agility and force. Be sure to watch your health level which is indicated by the number of Scooby Medals you have. If you reach zero, you will restart at the last save point but you can restore your health by collecting enough Scooby snacks that can be found throughout the game. Also, by collecting food items you can get Shaggy to cook you a special meal that will increase the total number of medals you have. In each world, when you’ve collected enough clues, Velma will ask you a few questions in order to figure out who is behind everything, and you must select the clues that you feel will answer these questions. When that’s completed, you will have to fight a boss before Velma will reveal who the identity of the villain. Scooby-Doo! Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu. You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points. You can replay any level as many times as you want so you can collect any missing items you still lack. In the extra menu, you will find Bonus Arts that features various conceptual art pieces used in the making of the game.</story>

In the beginning of the story, a giant castle appeared from above the city of Tokyo sometime during 2006. At 40 km, the ship-shaped castle was known as Nejireta castle. The battle between mankind and the gods is about to begin.Each character has a primary weapon, used by tapping or holding one firing button; holding the button for more than a few seconds, however, will switch to the character&apos;s secondary Shikigami weapon. This tends to be more powerful, but limited in range or utility, and also slows character movement. Each character&apos;s weapons are different, sometimes dramatically, in terms of pattern and power; in addition, each Shikigami weapon is available in one of two modes, chosen at the start of each new game.

    <story>Shrek SuperSlam is an intense brawling game that challenges the wacky characters from the Shrek universe to beat each other up and slam them across a variety of arenas. All the regular Shrek crew is included, such as Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, and Puss n&apos; Boots, along with some newcomers such as Cap&apos;n Hook, the Black Knight, and Quasimodo the Hunchback. Each character has their own special moves that capture the humor of the franchise (such as Shrek&apos;s Green Storm gas bombs), and the environments are colorful, filled with odd weapons, and highly destructible. Players have the option of following a story mode (where Donkey tells his half-breed Donkey kids a strange bedtime story), or just participating in straight-up brawls or minigame-like challenges. Multiplayer, of course, is a big focus on the game, and it allows up to 4 players to slam each other all day long.</story>

    <story>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run can be best described as Grand Theft Auto in Springfield. The player takes on the role of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa or Apu and try to uncover a mystery surrounding mechanical bees that are taking over Springfield, mysterious vans, and cola that can control the minds of those who drink it. Like GTA, the game follows a linear-based path through fifty plus missions. The player will have to chase cars and find out where they&apos;re headed, grab all the spilling cola cans before people can drink them, and chasing down villains before they get away. Throughout the course of the game, the player can unlock tons of rewards by completing missions in a set amount of time or performing outstanding stunts. All voiceovers are performed by those who act in the show, including Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa). The game supports multiplayer action for up to four players.</story>

    <story>Skies of Arcadia: Legends is a re-release of Skies of Arcadia, a well-known RPG for the Dreamcast. Two young pirates, Vyse and Aika, encounter on their journey a mysterious young girl named Fina. They decide to accompany her on her quest to gather six moon crystals. But it appears that Fina was not the only one looking for those crystals. The evil Valuan empire, lead by an ambitious warlock Galcian and his admirals, will do anything to stop Fina and her brave friends... The gameplay is largely based on world-map traveling (always in an airship), visiting various countries, and fighting in two modes: traditional party-based combat, and ship battles, where you control an entire ship and assign commands for four turns. What&apos;s new in this GameCube re-release? Graphics have been improved (especially character graphics), there are new sub-quests, and new characters with background stories which tell us more about the past of the game&apos;s heroes.</story>

    <story>Spider-Man, the classic comic book co-created by Stan Lee, is now a major motion picture. This conversion of the movie to the video game world takes the major storyline, characters and artwork of the Spider-Man movie and adds a lengthy backstory and new characters. The Green Goblin is the main villian here, and as Peter Parker you must defy gravity using your spider crawl, web-slinging and spider-sense abilities to track down Spidey&apos;s nemesis through the skyscapers of New York City. The major inclusion for this title over the previous Spider-Man series (on Playstation also by Activision) is aerial combat. Attack the enemy mid-air while web-slinging, rise and decend while swinging and banking around buildings create a greater emphasis on Spidey&apos;s greatest asset, the spider web.</story>

    <story>Based off the sequel to the popular 2002 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 2 once again places the player in the Web-Swinger&apos;s tights as he goes up against Dr. Octopus in this 3D adventure game. Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended (a la Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), allowing Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City, and doing everyday tasks from stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers, to delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle. However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</story>

    <story>In Spirits and Spells the player takes the role of the two kids Alicia and Greg who visit a spooky old house with their friends. Unfortunately the Bogeyman steals the souls of their friends and turns them into stone - of course the two heroes have to get them back. So they visit the Land of Dead and have to survive a cemetery, a haunted house and the lab of a mad scientist. The player can switch instantly (but limited because it costs crystals which can be found in the levels) between the two characters which is often needed to progress in the game: both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Alicia is disguised as a witch, is invulnerable to ice and can shrink herself. Greg on the other hand is the master of fire, is disguised as imp and has a super jump. Both have the same basic fighting abilities: hitting an enemy or jumping on their head kills them - but the same goes for the two kids which die with the first hit. Besides the fighting the game consists of platforming and simple puzzles. The game is in 3D but there is one linear path to follow (with a few junctions).</story>

There are a variety of events to compete in, from your usual all-on-all race through courses, scattered with obstacles and huge jumps to perform wacky tricks, plus there&apos;s a half pipe to bust tricks, and there&apos;s plenty of challenging tricks to master, and items to grind to gain bonuses. Plus, you can ride the entire mountain whenever you like, either to practice moves or learn all the bumps and corners for the big races. With challenges and races comes rewards, and along with trophies and medals to fill up your gallery you can also win cash prizes to purchase new items, improving your board or improving your image. The more you race the more experience your chosen character receives, leveling up your abilities and improving your technique, plus even more wild tricks to perform.</story>

With improved controls making Monster Jumps (Uber Tricks) easier to perform, everyone can look like a professional without learning button combos. As before, if you perform the same trick over and over, you won&apos;t get the points to take your skier/snowboarder from a novice to what they have a labeled black-diamond-dominating rockstar.

    <story>SSX Tricky is EA&apos;s follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC&apos;s It&apos;s Tricky to play. Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include behind-the-scenes footage and a making of segment.</story>

    <story>Star Fox Adventures is a sequel to the Star Fox series, following Star Fox on the SNES and Star Fox 64 on the Nintendo 64. Fox McCloud returns and is given a different mission than he is normally used to. At the far edge of the Lylat system, an evil army, led by General Scales, is destroying the world of Dinosaur Planet, rendering all its inhabitants helpless. It is now up to Fox McCloud and his team to save the planet and destroy the evil army. SFA breaks away from the previous games, for the game is a third person action/adventure game in the vein of Tomb Raider. You control Fox McCloud as he adventures through Dinosaur Planet, but at the beginning, you control Krystal, who Fox must later rescue. There are missions where you use your trusty Arwing craft, but the majority of the game takes place on foot. Helping you throughout your adventure are your trusty sidekicks; Peppy, Slippy, and ROB the Robot, who guide and give you mission briefings. To aid Fox throughout the game, a variety of weapons and magical items are available from blasters to grenades to magic staffs. You may also purchase items with &amp;quot;scarabs&amp;quot;, the game&apos;s currency. Throughout the game you may partake in various mini-games, which are found at different stores.</story>

Bounty Hunter also has the unique bounty hunting system, where each mission has a specific number of bounties hiding out in the level.

The 3rd person action title also includes full motion cut-scenes designed by Industrial Light and Magic and Skywalker Sound, plus a few hidden extras and Easter eggs.

The Clone Wars picks up with Mace Windu escorting the Jedi ambush to the Geonosis arena, which leads to the Battle of Geonosis and the start of the Clone Wars. After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var. After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var. They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon. Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy! The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat. Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles. You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon. Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.</story>

    <story>Starsky &amp; Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio &apos;Huggy Bear&apos; Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble. Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky &amp; Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through. The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal&apos;s car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers. Dave Starsky is the guy behind the steering wheel and Ken &apos;Hutch&apos; Hutchinson shoots out of the windows of the car. On PS2 and XBox a second player can take care of the shooting, using either a light gun or a standard controller. During single player, the aiming is automatic for shooting.</story>

    <story>The Sum of all Fears is a first person shooter game reminiscent of the Rogue Spear series. It&apos;s from the same development team and the look and feel is alike, although it&apos;s not as tactical as Rogue Spear. The game&apos;s story is build around the Tom Clancy book with the same title. You take control of a team of elite fighters trained for hostage rescue and anti-terror operations. Each and every team member is the best of the best. The first mission is to recapture a TV station seized by terrorists who broadcast their demands into the world. They have hostages, too, so you need to ensure that no-one gets hurt. But that&apos;s only the beginning of a global campaign against terrorism taking in 11 missions. A training mode and multiple difficulty levels are included. Unlike Rogue Spear, you can&apos;t choose team members or equipment, it&apos;s all pre-defined, from a range of over 15 guns plus grenades . You can&apos;t make your own mission plans either, so it comes down to controlling a team member, shooting every terrorist you see and performing various tasks (disarming security systems etc.). Unlike other shooter games, you can&apos;t survive many bullets, two wounds is usually enough to kill you. However, you then can switch to another team member.</story>

    <story>In the previous game, Summoner, Joseph became the god Urath, reborn by uniting the eight rings of summoning. Joseph’s culture hated the goddess Laharah and called her the “goddess of death.” This sequel takes place twenty years later in the realms of Halassar, Galdyr and Munari City which are across the world. You play Maia, who is the incarnate of the goddess Laharah and the powerful Queen of the realm of Halassar. Unlike Joseph’s kinship, Maia’s people worship Laharah as a benevolent creator. Maia was born with the mark of prophecy, her fate being written in the Book of Prophecy. From the beginning, she has welcomed her destiny and knows that she must fulfill the prophecy. What is unknown to her is the path she must follow to do so. Instead of summoning creatures to fight side-by-side with Maia, she actually becomes the demon when it is summoned. Three characters can be part of Maia’s party at one time and AI scripts can be assigned to each. Different characters are introduced as the story progresses and Maia’s skills improve. You can also choose to adventure in “solo-mode”, leaving your party members behind to go on alone. If you played the first game, you will notice immediately that Summoner 2 has a different combat system. Each button press results in the swing of your weapon so that you have more control over the action during battles. Unlike the first game, Summoner 2 was not released for Windows.</story>

    <story>Our four heroes from Super Monkey Ball - Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon - were enjoying a typical day, when they saw a flying machine crash down on a nearby island. Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island. And to top it all off, the prince and princess of the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren&apos;t found and returned, there&apos;s sure to be trouble! Can our heroes restore order to Monearth? Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on it. Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up. Certain parts of the island are locked by &apos;Puzzle Gates&apos; - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages which can be accessed in front of the gate. Each pad transports you to a different Puzzle Realm. The Puzzle Realm stages are the more familiar gameplay of Super Monkey Ball - simple looking stages where players must carefully (but quickly) roll their monkey to the finish line within the time limit. Bananas can also be collected throughout the game - these are used as currency, and can be used to unlock new playable characters and puzzle stages. They can also be given to particular unhappy citizens. The monkeys will also learn magical chants as they progress through the game - these allow you to climb walls, set your monkey&apos;s ball on fire, use a boxing glove to attack, and more. Also included in Super Monkey Ball Adventure are the famous Party Games - favorites like Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey fight return. There&apos;s also three new games: &apos;Monkey Cannon&apos; - fire monkeys at enemy towers to steal their bricks for your own tower. &apos;Monkey Bounce&apos; - bounce on a trampoline-like platform with your opponents, and try to claim as many squares as possible. &apos;Monkey Tag&apos; - roll around a globe and try to collect as many balloons as possible.</story>

The game is a Nintendo fighting game with different rules to it. Instead of knocking your opponent&apos;s health down, you knock him or her out of the battle field. You choose from the wealth of Nintendo characters like Mario, Bowser, Yoshi, different Pokémon, and even Link and then either fight through the single-player portion, featuring modes like Classic, Adventure, and Event Mode or battle it out with your friends in a four-player frenzy. More characters and stages are unlocked as hidden objectives are met, and coins rewarded for playing in all modes can be spent on a capsule toy machine. The toys in the machine represent games from Nintendo&apos;s entire video game history, and each can be viewed in 3D with a brief description. Also, with the simplified fighting controls, it&apos;s pretty easy for even your non-gaming friends to just pick-up and play. Playable characters come from the following games: 1.

The story is about how the people in Tak&apos;s village have set up a course of events for people to compete in. The game is a mixture of platforming and adventure. Tak and Lok have entered the event in hopes of winning. Introduced to this game is the ability to swap between characters with the touch of a butto or in 2 player mode you can play together in split screen. The characters have to reach various checkpoints to extend the level. All the levels take place in the various jungle settings of Tak&apos;s Village. The events consist of swimming, racing, climbing ropes, and other endurance challenges. Tak is the magic user while Lok is the brawn. During the game, the two characters provide comical banter with each other. Tak can use a chicken suit to fly and a lobster suit to swim underwater. The cutscenes are in real time. Taloc, the bad guy from the previous games, is nowhere to be found as the game now focuses on the Juju challenge and not on trying to defeat the bad guy. Patrick Warburton voices Lok.</story>

Tak and Jibolba, Tak&apos;s mentor, travel to visit Jibolba&apos;s brother, JB, who is an expert in dreams. Tak 2 is fairly different from Tak and the Power of Juju. While it is still a 3D platform game, it is more focused on puzzles and combat as opposed to collecting items. In earlier stages, Tak must use animals to his advantage as he makes his way through levels - for example, a bear can be used as a trampoline, Tak can ride warthogs after being sprayed by skunks to mask his scent, and more. Jibolba is along for the ride, but has transformed into a flea for easy transport. As a result, you can throw him at enemies to bite them and make them sleepy. Later on, Tak gains the power to transform into various animals himself. As a frog he can swim without being eaten by crocodiles, he can soar on air currents as a flying squirrel, and can break through barriers by charging through as a warthog. When Tak gains the titular Staff of Dreams as he progresses through the game, he can also create more powerful attacks using his magic, or juju.</story>

    <story>Tales of Symphonia is an RPG that starts off from the peaceful village of Iselia. Where Lloyd Irving is a student under the tutelage of Professor Raine Sage, who specializes in magic and archaeology. His school friend Colette Brunel has been rumored to be the daughter of an angel. She was born with a sacred stone in her hand, because of this she is the Chosen of Sylvarant. The Chosen must complete the world regeneration, a quest to unlock magic seals and enter the otherworldly Tower of Salvation, to make the slowly dying world a true paradise. This will mean the end of the Desians, a race of half elves, who now dominate the land through work camps, fear, and force. The characters develop not only through cut-scenes, many of which feature voice acting, but through what the game calls “skits”. These skits however, do not feature voice acting like the in-game cut-scenes. A warning is displayed on the bottom left hand side of the screen when a skit becomes available, it can then be activated by pressing Z. The Skit generally features two or more of the characters interacting. They will react to what is said and depending on the characters and the situation the results can be anywhere from comic to tragic. This system really allows one to understand the feelings each character. Special features of the game includes: Ex-Spheres, Strategy and Cooking. Ex-Spheres are special objects which enhances a character&apos;s abilities or may even grant new ones. These abilities can affect battle or have an effect outside of battle. Each Ex-Sphere will have a level of 1-4 each with more powerful abilities, up to four Ex-Spheres can be attached to any 1 character. Strategy can be applied to CPU controlled players, for example making spell-casters attack a specific enemy or ordering them to stay behind the front-lines. An alternate way to heal characters is to cook. This is based on the specific character&apos;s skill to cook and the ingredients used. Most of the game is spent, like most RPGs, in towns, dungeons, towers, sprawling world maps, and of course combat. Battles in Tales of Symphonia is fought in real-time. Only four members of your party can participate, each with very unique fighting styles. As the game progresses, you are not restricted to only using Lloyd, all major characters are playable which allows you to switch your gaming style. Basic physical attacks are carried out with the A button and pushing the control stick in various directions. The B button is used for special physical attacks and casting spells. Often these special attacks can be linked from a basic physical attack to Special Attacks in progressing levels of 1-3. During a battle you run in a straight line and are able to jump over enemies. In Multiplayer up to 3 more players may partake in battles with you.</story>

Living in the sewers, they creep out when nobody is looking to fight for truth, justice and another slice of pizza. Fighting against the public face of inventor Baxter Stockman and the more shadowy figure of Shredder and his Foot Clan, these Ninja Turtles will get the chance to make their opponents eat shell! The game is a 3D beat-em-up with multiple players. The game sprites all resemble the cartoony look of the TV show and each turtle features unique moves, sound bytes and fighting style all his own. Ninja Turtle moves include a weaker/quicker attack, a stronger/slower attack, Ninja Shuriken and a Jump-Kick.</story>

    <story>Tiger Woods is back for another round of golf in the 2004 edition of the best selling pro golf series. The biggest addition to this version is EA&apos;s Game Face, which lets you customize everything and anything. You have the basics, such as hair, skin, facial hair and other general appearances, but Game Face allows you to customize every other aspect, from teeth shape, logos, tattoos, headbands, hats, and more. You may also change individual body mass, muscle tone, mid-section, arms and legs. You also have the option of choosing specific swing style animations, post-putt and celebration animations, and pissed off animations for when you score a triple bogey. One of the new modes is World Tour, which puts you through a standard 52-week PGA tour to earn money, sponorships, and better gear. You can play for up to twenty seasons. The other new game mode is Battle Golf, where you can win an opponent&apos;s clubs if you beat them. All the other standard game modes are here, from Skill Challenge and Speed Golf to a Skins Match or Practice. A new feature is the game&apos;s ability to read your console&apos;s internal clock, and provide you with game modes. If it&apos;s near the end of October and your clock is properly set, you may be invited to a Halloween event where you can win items specific to that event. All top PGA players are included for you to play as (or against), including Vijay Singh and Justin Leonard. Newcomers to the sport have also been added, such as John Daly. Most of the courses from 2003 have made it, with seven new courses, both real and fantasy. One of the new courses is Bethpage Black, an extremely difficult course located in Washington. Like all other 2004 EA Sports console games, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004 has the EA Sports Bio, which tracks your accomplishments and games over all EA Sports titles. The more EA Sports games you play, and the longer you play them, will increase your EA Gamer Level and unlock additional rewards, such as a new driver in Tiger Woods or historic teams in NHL 2004. This feature isn&apos;t on the PC version. Gamers who buy the PlayStation 2 version will be able to play online through EA&apos;s matchmaking service. You cannot play online with the Xbox or GameCube versions. If you buy the GameCube version, you can use the GameBoy Advance to hook up to the GameCube to unlock special rewards not available through normal play.</story>

    <story>The Timesplitters series returns with a hair-raising flight across time to discover the origin of the Timesplitters in an effort to turn the tides of the war that is ripping apart mankind. The final game in the Timesplitters trilogy, Timesplitters: Future Perfect picks up right where Timespliters 2 left off: in the cockpit of Cortez&apos;s escape ship. Cortez soon begins a race through time in order to find out the origins of the Timesplitters. As Cortez investigates strange happenings at a Scottish castle, he soon begins unraveling the mystery of the Timesplitters. Cortez crosses paths with the creepy, the weird, the downright funny, and even multiple versions of himself as he blazes across time leaving a ruined space-time continuum in his wake. Cortez soon finds out that he may have more to do with the creation of the Timesplitters than he thinks! Battle across 13 story missions spread across 6 time periods, either alone or co-operatively with a friend. Be prepared to meet some old friends from the series, and some new enemies. Take on computer controlled opponents in one of the many game modes on any of the 15 arcade maps (or make own), or compete for awards in dozens of arcade league matches and wacky challenges. Choose from between 150 characters and challenge friends to a head-to-head battle, either with up to 4 player split screen or online and LAN play on the PS2 and XBox.</story>

    <story>TimeSplitters 2, the sequel to Free Radical Design&apos;s PlayStation 2 launch title, once again sends players hurtling through time, as they battle the malevolent TimeSplitters in ten unique time periods, from the Wild West to a futuristic space station, and everything in between. The game&apos;s story finds Cortez, the series&apos; hero, on a quest to discover the origins of the TimeSplitters, an enigmatic group that travels through time causing trouble for the good people of Earth. Using the paradoxes of time travel to his advantage, the hero can regularly join up with past and future versions of himself, to fight the enemy as a team. A wide selection of historical, modern, and futuristic weapons is available, and environments feature destructible elements. Depending on the difficulty level chosen, players will find themselves with rudimentary objectives to complete or, on the harder settings, new areas and substantially more involved objectives to fulfill. Two players can also play the Story mode cooperatively and simultaneously. Like its predecessor, TimeSplitters 2 features a Challenge mode, which presents the player with a selection of time- and skill-based events. Completing these within the predetermined constraints awards the player with bronze, silver, or gold medals, which in turn aid in unlocking additional game options, levels, and playable characters (of which there are more than 120). The Arcade mode offers League, Custom, and Network sub-modes. League events feature pre-configured maps, game types, and objectives for the player to compete in, while the other Arcade modes make up the bulk of the multiplayer portion of the title. In the Custom mode, up to four players and numerous AI bots can compete in 16 different customizable disciplines including Deathmatch, Regeneration, Virus, Thief, Shrink, Monkey Assistant, and Flame Tag -- each offering an altered form of gameplay. Thief, for example, tasks players with collecting tokens left behind by fallen combatants. Here, the tokens determine the winner, not the number of kills.</story>

    <story>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee is a 3D fighting game based on the 2003 animated series. The combat system is similar to the earlier games based on that series, but unlike them, it is a competitive vs. fighting game. It is not a traditional one-on-one fighter, but an arena-based, four-player game - somewhat along the lines of Power Stone. There are two game modes. There is a single-player adventure mode in which you must guide one of ten characters (including six unlockables) through a series of 100 bouts that have you either beating up enemies, or, in a few cases, dodging bombs for a set amount of time. Completion of these portions unlocks the additional characters, bonus characters and stages for melee mode. Melee mode is the multiplayer portion. It has ten basic and twelve unlockable characters, and nine basic and fifteen unlockable stages. There are four game types which mirror popular types from first-person shooters. There is a deathmatchesque knock-out mode, where the goal is to score the most KOs. (Players respawn after being KOed.) There is also a Last Man Standing mode, where the goal is to be the only player left when the others are KOed, a King of the Hill, where you must stand on a glowing patch of ground and defend it from other players, and a Keep away mode, where you must hold a treasure chest and avoid other players who are trying to beat you up and take it.</story>

    <story>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York. A mysterious figure calling himself the Nightwatcher has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets! TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle. Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights. Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York. Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff. Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you&apos;ll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on. Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away. If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack. Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his &apos;rage&apos; builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged. The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses. The basic goal for each level is to get to the end. At the end of each level, you&apos;re graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected. In levels where you work with your brothers, you&apos;ll also be graded on how well you worked together. Succeed in a these attributes, and you&apos;ll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables. If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you&apos;ll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins. Finally, once you&apos;ve played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.</story>

    <story>Lockdown is the third Rainbow Six game to appear on the consoles, this time with Red Storm Entertainment fully behind the wheel. Once again, you play as Domingo &apos;Ding&apos; Chavez, leading a small commando team on black-ops missions. This time, however, the developer strays from the realistic squad-based action in favor of more arcadish gameplay. The main single player campaign is based around a dangerous virus and hostages. In certain missions, you play as sniper Dieter Weber, picking off terrorists from higher ground and providing cover while the team infiltrates the building. The differences between the console versions are the number of missions and the availability of certain gadgets. There is an offline two-player, split-screen cooperative mode available (up to 4 over Xbox live) and full online multiplayer up to 16 players featuring traditional deathmatch, objective-based games and CTF modes, on Xbox and PS2. While the PS2 version includes a Rivalry mode, Xbox online multiplayer has an RPG element: the P.E.C. mode (Persistent Elite Creation). Before playing, you choose an avatar and a class with specific abilities (commando, engineer, spec op and medic). While playing, you earn credits and experience, which can be traded in for new weapons, items or amour. Gear regularly needs to be repaired, shown by the durability level, and experience can be used to assign skills points to abilities, individualizing your character.</story>

The difference between this one and other shooting games is that you get shot once or twice and you&apos;re dead. Meaning mission is over. No extra lives, no respawn point.

    <story>Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan&apos;s constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all. In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score. The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a &amp;quot;tunnel&amp;quot; like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they&apos;d like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location. Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales. The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.</story>

Times are changing, America&apos;s enemies are looking at new options, finding ways to make themselves more deadly. In order to star one step ahead of its target, Third Echelon is also changing and while Sam Fisher&apos;s foes are evolving and his allies are in flux, Fisher&apos;s own life will undergo some dramatic and permanent changes. And once that happens nothing will ever be the same. With his life turned upside down, Fisher is on a new mission unlike any he has ever been sent on before. Where he used to penetrate defenses and gather information from the outside, now he is on the inside, working with those he has sworn to destroy and finding enemies among his allies. He is risking everything for the sake of the greater good, even if it costs him his identity or his life. Play the game in a stealth manner or in a gun blazing way and your experience will be different every time you play. Try to sneak around the enemies and kill, interrogate or neutralize them without anyone else notice. There are 3 different endings depending on your choices in the game. Different settings will be visited during the game such as a prison, a boat in Cozumel, visit Africa, and many more. You will get many different weapons and gadgets to help you through your journey. Use gadgets to close the lights, use gadget to electrify enemies in water pond, and scan the surroundings using your many visions (electric, night vision, heat vision) to identify potential gameplay objects around the worlds. This version is quite different from the Xbox 360/Windows release. They share the same engine (although it is not multi-threaded), but this release adds an additional single-player mission with alternate ending, a new Spies vs. Spies online mode, 14 co-op missions playable offline (also online for the Xbox version), LAN, and 8 minutes of additional cinematics. There are also some changes in the storyline. The Wii/GameCube versions only have co-op multiplayer. The Spies vs. Spies multiplayer offers different game modes: 1.

    <story>In Pandora Tomorrow, you reprise your role as Sam Fisher, along with old friends Irving Lambert and Anna Grimsdottir. A terrorist has a disease which he plans to spread through the United States. He makes daily phone calls to an undisclosed location every day, delaying the release of the disease by one more day. As Fisher, you must find out who the terrorist is, where he is, who he is working for, and above all, stop him. In order to do this, you are taken all around the world, from Paris to Indonesia to the holy land Jerusalem. Sam comes equipped with his standard pistol and SC-20K. The SC has been improved, with an added scope with two levels of zoom. You have access to all the equipment from the first game, including Sticky Shockers, Diversion Cameras, Frag and Smoke Grenades. Sam has also learned some new moves. He has the ability to perform a SWAT turn, which allows him to pass from one side of an open door to the other without being spotted. He may perform a half-split jump, enabling him to lean against one side of a wall to give him boost to jump higher. He can also whistle, to attract the attention of any nearby enemies. Pandora Tomorrow also has a full fledged multiplayer game, playable on Xbox Live. The multiplayer ties in to the single player campaign, and it pits the Shadownet team (spies) against the Argus team (mercs). The game supports four players. Members of Shadownet must infiltrate various complexes to retrieve canisters of a deadly liquid, but they must watch out for cameras, motion sensors and trip lasers, all of which alert the mercs to their position. The spy cannot kill with weapons, but he can stun the mercs for several seconds in order to sneak up and kill from behind. On the other side, the mercs must make their way to each canister, guarding it from the Shadownet team. Whenever an alarm is tripped, the merc is instantly alerted to where the spy is. To help fight the Shadownets, the mercs have a built-in motion sensor view, which picks up any moving objects, as well as an electromagnetic view, which picks up on spy gadgets. The mercs come equipped with a rifle, and must defend the viral canisters at all costs. Multiplayer comes with a good variety of maps, ranging from a warehouse and a factory to a cinema and three towering skyscrapers. More maps will be available in the future via Xbox Live.</story>

    <story>In Splinter Cell, you take on the role of Sam Fisher, an operative for the secret organization Third Echelon. SC is a third-person stealth based game, similar to Metal Gear Solid. Third Echelon is a secret organization, a part of the U.S. government. The organization deals with very sensitive missions, and you play as Sam, Third Echelon&apos;s splinter cell. Your missions are so discreet, that if you are captured, the government will deny any such existence of that organization. Since it&apos;s a stealth based game, you have a variety of moves at your disposal. You can walk, run, crouch, jump, rappel, shimmy, cross horizontal wires, zip using a zip cord, and do a split jump. To defeat your enemies, you have a variety of means. You can use your weapons, but the noise might alert a guard. You can stun them, kill them, subdue them, jump down from the ceiling and knock them unconcious. Some enemies are needed to activate a door or passcode, so you can take an enemy hostage by holding a gun to his head, you can interrogate them, or you can use them as human shields. Some of the more innovative features of the game is the ability to peak through a door before going through. You can open it up a bit to peak through, or you can use your optic cable camera (a snake camera) to peer through the underside of the door, checking to make sure it&apos;s clear. Being a stealth based game, your arsenal is small. You have an automatic rifle that can be fitted with a silencer and other modifications, and you also have a trusty pistol. Splinter Cell also has downloadable content, so you can download new items in the future, specifically new levels and missions.</story>

    <story>You are a new skater in the city of L.A.. The main drive of the game is that your hanging around with a skating group and its leader, who also happens to be a skating legend, at their skate park in Beverly Hills called Skate Ranch. Throughout the game you must help your friends by getting skate pieces for Skate Ranch. The game marks the third reinvention of the series, with Pro Skater being the first, and Underground being the second. It comes with brand new features like the ability to change your personal appearance in game, as well as the ability to get off of the skateboard and use a BMX. For the first time all of levels are strung together into one big environment, which gets rid of loading times and menu selection. Old features were also kept like Create-a-park, which dates back to the Pro Skater series. Missions are still acquired by going up to random people or friends and accepting the mission they want you to run. The game also includes a multiplayer mode and co-op for up to 2 players for added replay value.</story>

    <story>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics. The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV&apos;s Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course). The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair. And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</story>

    <story>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision&apos;s ever popular franchise. The main feature of this game is it&apos;s redesigned career mode. When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits. When you&apos;re ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX. Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that. There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo. Miss a trick, and goal fails. Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard. All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas. The levels are been expanded and are huge. Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz. For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill. New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo. THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live. The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one. The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray&apos;s Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</story>

    <story>The fifth game in the series, Tony Hawk&apos;s Underground is the first game to have a true career mode. You begin the game as a local skater whom nobody knows. Your board is wearing thin, and your tired of being a nobody. As your out skating, you see a flyer for a pro who&apos;s coming to your city to demo. You go to the skate demo and watch. Afterwards, you try to impress the pro, and he gives you advice on how to go about becoming a star. With your friend, Eric, you&apos;re now on your way to becoming a legend. THUG takes you to various cities to perform different goals. You begin in New Jersey, which acts as a sort of training stage, where goals are simple. Eventually, you&apos;ll visit Manhattan, Vancouver, Moscow, Tampa, San Diego and Hawaii. Most cities are split into different chapters, with each chapter opening new goals. THUG introduces a new system; walking. You can get off your skateboard to run or walk around the level. If there&apos;s a high tower you want to jump off of, get off your board, climb to the tower (by climbing a ladder or shuffling across a wire), get back on your board, and jump down. One of the new tricks associated with this is the Acid Drop, which can launch you off an opposing pipe, allowing you to pull off 1080&apos;s and up. Also new to THUG is the ability to drive certain vehicles, like a gardener&apos;s truck, a sports car, or a leaf blower. These are used for goals, but can be unlocked to drive whenever and wherever. Next to the standard Create-a-Park and Create-a-Skater, you can now create your own decks and your own tricks. The biggest feature is Create-a-Goal. You can create custom goals for one of the levels (or your own), and choose what pedestrian will give it to you, his/her dialogue, and what they&apos;ll say when you win. The PlayStation 2 version supports online play.</story>

    <story>Tony Hawk&apos;s Underground 2 is the sixth game in the Tony Hawk series. As an aspiring pro skater, you&apos;re invited to join Tony Hawk in an around-the-world underground skating competition known as the World Destruction Tour. It&apos;s Team Hawk against Team Bam in a no-holds-barred contest to gain the most points by performing insane stunts and raising havoc in cities all over the world. THUG 2&apos;s story mode basically follows the same formula as THUG, in which you have to complete a number of goals before you can move on to the next city. Re-introduced into the series is the Classic Mode wherein you have 2 minutes to complete as many goals as possible on any of THUG 2&apos;s levels and 6 remade classic levels. THUG 2 has all-new unlockable characters, vehicles, levels. All the Create-A-Modes from THUG are present, with the addition of the new Create-A-Graphic mode where you can make your own graffiti design with layers of text and predefined graphics, then use it to tag up during gameplay. THUG 2 supports online play (Playstation 2 only) and 2-player split-screen modes in a variety of new and classic multiplayer games.</story>

Next to the basic action missions there is some focus on stealth and escorting too. Some sections require a key to be found in order to progress. While fighting, there is a focus on head shots, as enemies can take a lot of bullets in other body parts before going down. There are eight missions in total. There are different types of weapons including a blade, machine guns and sniper rifles, but only a small amount of clips can be carried. Enemies hardly ever leave anything behind, so ammo crates need to be hunted down.</story>

Due to your extreme methods of policing and your ability to cause massive amounts of property damaged, you are suspended, only to be recruited by the EOD (Elite Operations Division), where your reckless attitude is a plus. 240 square miles of Los Angeles has been accurately rendered for you to cause havoc in. As a cop, you must behave when doing your duty. The game has a good cop/bad cop system, that gives you points based on what you do. Beat up an innocent pedestrian or run over a criminal that&apos;s surrendered and your rating will go down. Eventually, you can lose stats you&apos;ve built up. Arrest a surrendering criminal or frisk an innocent that&apos;s acting suspicious, and your rating will go up, enabling you to upgrade certain aspects. There are two main modes of getting around; on foot or in car. You can hijack (or, in police terms, commedate) various cars. Sports cars, sedans, etc. are yours for the taking. Each has various handling and stats. Since you&apos;re a well trained cop, you&apos;re capable of firing your weapon while driving. In an open top vehicle, you can aim anywhere. The other method is walking. While walking, you may encounter the odd street crime or suspicious looking pedestrian, which will let you get good or bad points, depending. True Crime features a branching storyline with three different endings, depending on how good or bad you are. In missions where you&apos;re required to do something, failing does not mean repeating the mission. If you fail to tail someone to a hideout, you&apos;ll have a harder time finding that hideout in a later mission, whereas if you capture someone, your next mission will be easier. Aside from gunplay, you&apos;re well trained in martial arts. You can pull off various punch and kicks, as well as combos. You can also grapple and possibly throw someone, ala a wrestling move.</story>

    <story>TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is a 3D Platformer with an Australian theme. The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY&apos;s quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at. While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.). There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.</story>

It&apos;s up to Ty to reunite his team members, as well as stop the Quinkan from unleashing the mysterious Quinking, an evil being of supreme power. Night of the Quinkan is the third game in the Ty series. As Ty, players can bite at foes, or use his boomerangs for consecutive ranged attacks. Boomerangs can be customized in an assortment of ways: either by changing the chassis (each chassis has its own special abilities); or by equipping special Bunyip Stones to the boomerang&apos;s chassis. Some stones can be combined with others, allowing players to customize their attacks to their liking. Some stones are rewards for completing tasks; others, as well as boomerang chassis, can be purchased from the Rang Shop in exchange for Opals, the game&apos;s currency. Ty 3 again rolls out the robotic mechs - choose from the Shadow or Extreme Bunyip (your standard mech), the Crabmersible (a submarine shaped like a crab, oddly enough), or the Gunyip (a speedy airplane with an assortment of bombs and guns). Ty can even take part in cart races against other characters for powerups and even more opals.</story>

    <story>After many years under Eidos/Silicon Dreams ownership and development, EA releases the official Champions League game for the 2004/2005 season. The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it&apos;s gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes), advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized targeting and push and shove featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future&apos;s FIFA Manager. The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players. The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the The Season mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final. This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, home and away (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.</story>

    <story>Ultimate Muscle: Legends vs. New Generation is a wrestling game based on the Kinnikuman anime series. The mechanics of the game are clearly arcade in its realization, as they intend to emulate the spectacularity of the anime. This is specially experienced through the special moves, attacks that can be executed when a specific bar hits the top, which in many cases allow you to have your rival projected to the air and still be able to apply him a lock before he hits the ground. Regarding playable fighters, this game combines 20 characters from both the oldest and newer seasons of the series, among them: Kid Muscle, Terry Kenyon, Wally Tusket, Checkmate, Dik Dik Van Dik, Kevin Mask, Jeager, King Muscle, Sunshine, Ramenman, Buffaloman, Terryman, Brocken Jr, etc; plus 10 more, who are &amp;quot;guests&amp;quot; unrelated to the anime series. Other notable aspect of the game is the power-ups: items thrown by your team partner or the manager himself, that among many things can increase your energy or special bars, but also injure your opponents.</story>

    <story>When 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten by a genetically altered spider he became faster, stronger, more agile and gained the spider-like ability to cling to walls. Add web shooters and a costume and Peter becomes Spider-Man. Eddie Brock, Jr. is Peter’s childhood friend. In search of his scientist father’s legacy, Eddie came in contact with a symbiotic suit which transformed him into the monstrous Venom. Ultimate Spider-Man follows both their Brian Michael Bendis-scripted adventures, as Spidey attempts to prevent Venom from killing innocents while Venom seeks to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D.’s machinations. The Ultimate version of the Spider-Man mythos revamps the franchise, bringing in edgier (and often younger) versions of famous superheroes and supervillains. The Human Torch, Wolverine, Electro, and Green Goblin are some of the Ultimate characters who make appearances. Ultimate Spider-Man features a fully rendered, cel-shaded Manhattan open to exploration. With few exceptions, Spider-Man and Venom can explore Manhattan and Queens, climbing, jumping, and web swinging away. Story missions show up as hot spots on the map as do other in-game objectives. When the player is done patrolling (or destroying) the city, they can hit these hot spots to advance the story. Between story missions, Spider-Man and Venom can follow race paths, go on combat tours, discover and collect hidden icons, and help (or hurt) the citizens of New York.</story>

Blue and Silvia, along with many others as well as a group of villains fighting each other in a series of battles in multiple environments, such as a construction site, a warehouse and a wrestling ring to name a few. The story has Captain Blue getting ready to shoot a new movie, but has trouble deciding who will be the lead character, so he sets up a tournament of the heroes to determine it. The player takes control of one of the three heroes, battling a set of enemies, each stage having their own set objectives to complete in order to advance. There is also a party mode that can support up to four-different players in an all out brawl. Players can collect VFX Orbs throughout the fight, collecting enough will allow the player to use a VFX power on the opponent(s). The PSP port is virtually the same same, but with added content exclusive to it, a single player Trial Mode, where the player competes in a series of mini-games, the ability to play as Dante from the Devil May Cry series and a game sharing feature that lets players play wirelessly using Ad-Hoc and play certain stages using only one disc.</story>

Customization is limited, but players can change the color of their racer, optimize the engine for either acceleration or speed, and optimize handling to be either tight or loose. However, settings have little effect on the racer&apos;s actual performance. There are eight different courses, however, there are a total of 19 racing tracks laid out across these courses, plus one stunt track for each course. Also, there are five different weathers, consisting of Sunny, Partially Sunny, Light Rain, Rain, and Stormy. These weathers can have dramatic effects on tracks, making a track raced in Sunny weather totally different when raced in Stormy weather conditions.

Pooh will also have to talk to other characters to complete his tasks. For example, in Piglet&apos;s Birthday, you will have to find Kenga and borrow her broom for Piglet.

About all the features of its original 2D ancestors are also present, including random wind and a fully destructible landscape. Not all the weapons that were previously available have made the cut into the 3 dimensional realm, however Worms 3D comes too with a selective set of new weaponry such as the Lottery Strike or the Gas Grenade which should allow you to find a few dozen of new ways to kill your fellow worms online.</story>

The main goal of the game is still the same, to burst the bubbles, however this time instead of featuring little and cute dinosaurs, Worms Blast introduces battle-hardened worms or explosive sheep angry for points, battling up on boats. Fortunately, Worms Blast is not just a mere copycat of Puzzle Bobble with cell-shaded graphics. Team 17 have made numerous changes to the gameplay, which make playing the game quite a different experience. Along others, these change include the ability to actually move your character or to shoot on the other player, different kinds of weapons and a load of varied gameplay modes.

You can also create your own wrestlers and put them in the story mode. The graphics and the fighting system have been improved. Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan join the roster as Legends. The game has some strategy elements which is unusual the wrestling game genre. The gameplay is revolved around stamina rather than just a general energy level. If all stamina is gone, the player won&apos;t be able to control the wrestler. In addition, players can perform up to four unique submission moves. The game is also very bloody, ranging from a small cut on the forehead, to a face full of blood and blood on the chest. Blood also drips onto the mat and stays there. A new type of match called The Last Man Standing is included in this game. This is similar to being knocked out but being counted out while stunned. The Create-A-Wrestler feature has returned for this game and is used for story mode.</story>

    <story>XIII is a cel-shaded first-person shooter based on the popular Belgian cult comic created by Jean Van Hamme and illustrated by William Vance. The game is loosely based on the first five comics. The main theme of the game is based on Robert Ludlum&apos;s book &apos;The Bourne Identity&apos; and features a man who is suffering from amnesia and quite possibly involved in the recent assassination of the President of the United States. You must be damn important, because everyone is trying to kill you. As you progress, you learn more about your secret agent past and your curious name, XIII. You unravel clues behind a conspiracy of epic proportions in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions such as head shots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, XIII has all the typical FPS elements: both stealth and action, more than 15 weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and a whole load of baddies in levels all over the world. During the game, you can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lockpicking and dual weapons handling.</story>

    <story>Every 1000 years, a tournament takes place on Earth to decide the most powerful Mamodo. This time, Zatch Bell is determined to win. The only problem? He can&apos;t fight alone. Assisting him is the human Kiyo, who, by reading spells from a book, can activate Zatch&apos;s powers. In this 3D fighting game, you will control Kiyo, or one of 19 other characters, each with a associated Mamodo. You can either attack your opponent directly, or have your Mamodo attack with a spell. (Four attack spells, one defensive spell, and one super spell.) You can even switch control to your Mamodo directly, though this leaves you defenseless. Mamodo Fury features a surprisingly long story mode for a fighting game, stage select, 1 and 2 player vs mode, arcade mode, and several types of minigames, for 1 to 4 players.</story>

    <story>Based on the toy franchise and later the anime series, Zoids: Battle Legends casts the player as one of 17 soldiers with different abilities, controlling one of the giant robots modelled after animals and the dinosaurs. There are 4 main modes: Mission, Zoids Battle, VS and Zoids Fist. In the mission mode the player chooses a side (empire or republic) and fights other giant Zoid robots in different stages, connected by cut-scenes pushing the narrative forward. As an empire soldier, you start as Kouki, a young officer hunting the republicans. On the republican side of things, the game starts with Shomo is search of the Blue Unicorn Team that has gone missing. Most of the modes are fairly identical, but Zoids Fist is played in confined spaces. There are different characters and robots available while playing, and the Zoids can lock on targets to fire, move around and use boost for quick manoeuvres. Close combat is also possible, in wrestling-style fashion. Every Zoid has different upgrade slots for armor, weapons and shields. The colour can also be defined. The environment is destructible and can be used to your advantage for instance with sniping positions on top of buildings.</story>

    <story>Zoids: Full Metal Crash is a 3D fighting game for the Nintendo Gamecube that was developed by Tomy Corporation and exclusively released in Japan during 2005. The game is pretty standard as far as fighting games go, with each Zoid having its own move set depending on certain buttons, as well as special moves that can be used throughout battle. The game features two main modes; a story mode, which has different outcomes depending on your answers, and Zi Fighters mode, which has randomized opponents. It has a degree of customization for all Zoids, including switching weapons that are never customized in other medias (such as having Jager boosters on a Command Wolf AC, or giving a Liger Zero just the Schneider blades). Unfortunately, there are very few Zoids in the game to be had, with half of them only being variations of the less than 15 available from the game. </story>

The game features characters taken from the series as well as introduces a few new ones. Additionally, every Zoid features a special attack, called an EX Attack, that can be used once the Zoid&apos;s hit points drop below 1/3. Many of the EX attacks are special attacks featured in the anime, such as the Blade Liger&apos;s Hi-Blade attack, the Geno Saurer&apos;s Charged Particle Cannon, or the Liger Zero&apos;s Strike Laser Claw. </story>

    <story>ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points. The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player&apos;s opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</story>

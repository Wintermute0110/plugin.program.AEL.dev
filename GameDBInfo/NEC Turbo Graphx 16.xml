    <story>Aero Blasters is a fast side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a small craft through different levels with many enemies. Every level ends with a boss and some section speed up the gameplay, offering fast obstacle courses both horizontally and vertically scrolling. Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any points as long as there are lives and credits left. The game can be played with two players cooperatively.</story>

    <story>In 1992, Hudson Soft expanded upon the Bonk&apos;s Adventure franchise they had built by creating Air Zonk, a 2D side-scrolling cute &apos;em up shooter set in a cyberpunk-esque future. While Air Zonk differed from its successor in terms of gameplay, the cartoonish style of the Bonk series could still be seen all throughout the game, especially in the graphics, the characters, &amp; of course, Zonk himself. Air Zonk may appear to feature a candy cartoon coating on the outside, but it&apos;s still a traditional shoot-&apos;em-up at heart. You still have a selection of your basic weapon power-ups (8 in total here), but spread guns &amp; powerful bursts are now represented by killer decks of cards &amp; giant metal mandibles. Large, imposing endbosses are still the norm, but here your foes range from giant heaps of living garbage to killer football players. And outer space? Who needs to blow up things there when you have other venues (5 in total) such as a gigantic stadium to do it in? In addition to all of this, Air Zonk gives you a feature that allows you to choose from one of 10 friends at the beginning of each level who will fight by your side once you pick up a certain power-up. These friends range from giant scud missiles to living dump trucks to floating cow-things, among others. Pick up another power-up, &amp; Zonk &amp; his friend combine to create a powerful hybrid form, featuring some of the strangest attacks you may ever see in a video game. So will Zonk be able to defeat King Drool, rescue the moon from his clutches, &amp; save the world? As usual, the answer is up to you...</story>

    <story>Battle Royale is a wrestling game that presents last-man-standing type battles between up two five wrestlers. The game features three difficulty settings, five wrestlers to choose from, and two game modes. For single players only is the tournament mode, featuring 15 possible consecutive battles, beginning with one-on-ones and continuing up to a full five-man match. In the second mode, the number of competitors can be freely set for a single match. There is a catch in how a player chooses their wrestler, though: before the match, the fighters&apos; managers duke it out on their way to select their favorite fighter - temporarily knocking out the opposition is encouraged. The matches take place in a side view of the ring. The A and B buttons are used for a variety of kicks and punches and the Select button can be used for an extra powerful attack. The goal is to toss the opponents out of the ring and remain the last man standing. The single match mode can be played by up to five human players.</story>

    <story>Black Bomberman has cut power to the galaxy&apos;s own power station, which resulted in disputes between seven planets, and it is up to White Bomberman to restore power to the station and bring peace to the planets again. The objective is the same as in Dyna Blaster: use bombs to destroy all enemies in a level. Once you have destroyed them all, find the exit hidden in a block so you can be transported to the next level. A block will also flash yellow to let you know that a power-up can be obtained there. Power-ups include more bombs, manual detonation, extra lives, and extended flames. Occasionally, you also get the ability to walk through bombs or walls, or to kick bombs. If you manage to reveal the exit before all enemies are destroyed, it remains in an inactive state, meaning that you cannot be transported to the next level until you blow up all the enemies and therefore making it active. If you accidentally blow up the exit, whether it is active or not, or if time runs out, you will unleash a few enemies that you also need to destroy. After every eighth level, there is a boss that you need to destroy to proceed to the next planet. Besides this Normal mode, there are two other modes: Battle and Versus. In Battle, you can play against four human- or computer-controlled players in one of seven stages, each with different features like warp holes, conveyor belts, revolving doors, and much more. In Versus, you play head-to-head against a friend using the TurboExpress for non-stop action. Regardless of these two modes, you can still obtain power-ups to give out some punishment against your fellow players, and the maximum number of wins can be set before play.</story>

Players can both control the legendary boxers or measure up against them in the ring. The game includes single player exhibition and career modes, a two-player versus mode and an auto-play mode which sees AI boxers taking each other on for demonstration. Career mode starts in 1968 and lasts up to fifteen years, with one fight per year, taking into account the actual historical standings of the featured boxers. In career mode, all fights last 12 rounds, while in the other modes the number of rounds can be set between 3 and 12. Fights are shown from the side of the ring. Controls allow for five different punches: Button II launches a jab, while button I in combination with a direction button enables left and right hooks, a body blow and an uppercut. Pressing Run blocks high, Run + Down blocks low. Clinching is possible when in close proximity and it is also possible to taunt the opponent with a showboating move. Strength and stamina meters show the condition of the boxer: the opponent landing a blow lowers strength, throwing punches lowers stamina. When strength is depleted, the boxer is knocked down and must button-mash to get back up, the difficulty of which increases with each knockdown. Rounds last 3 minutes. Between rounds, the corner screen appears for 30 seconds, showing judges&apos; scores, statistics about punches landed, successful blocks and knockdowns made and a visualization of the damage to the boxers&apos; faces. In the 30 seconds, it is possible to either regain strength or stamina or to increase the power of certain punches. Progress in career mode is stored via password or backup memory on a TurboGrafx-CD or with a TurboBooster-Plus.</story>

Gameplay is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.</story>

This athlete can be saved to disk and further improved during the course of time. For exhibition matches, the opponent can be built the same way. The game includes various hit types, depending on the player&apos;s position and timing. The direction of the ball can also be influenced when performing a shot. There are four different surfaces, influencing the gameplay, and three difficulty levels.</story>

Fortunately, the A.N.G.E.L. is helped on its way by a number of power-ups - for instance, Healing Power completely repairs the sub and Speed Power speeds it up. Up to three modes of attack can be used to combat the mutant fish - the starting Pulse Shot, the destructive Swirl Cutter, and the Bubble Beam. But the A.N.G.E.L. is not indestructible. Four colors on the A.N.G.E.L.&apos;s eye indicate the amount of damage the sub has sustained, and when it&apos;s had enough and explodes, that&apos;s the end of the A.N.G.E.L. and the end of the game.</story>

    <story>Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20 dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players start exploring the dungeon from different points. The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be defeated in order to proceed. The combat is turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly, and the enemies will attack even if the player does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button; there are no other combat options. The player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to restore the player character&apos;s HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic. There is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text intros to the different dungeons, along the lines of the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a warrior into the dungeon or comparable mission objectives.</story>

    <story>Dragon&apos;s Curse aka: Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&apos;s Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain his original human form, he has to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land. Unlike its predecessor, this side-scrolling platform game is not divided in sequences of levels. The protagonist is allowed to go anywhere, as long as he has the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give him a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls. These abilities also allow the player access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes. The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen it is possible to equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, the player collects keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and places need to be re-visited sometimes to access new areas. Equipment and items can be bought in towns. A password is given at the beginning of each town to continue from there.</story>

He has conquered this land and plunged it into an age of terror and despair, plagued with violence. It is up to you to stand against him and return your world to its former glory. Dungeon Explorer plays like Gauntlet: you choose one of several different characters to play as (Fighter, Thief, Warlock, Witch, Bard, Bishop, Elf and Knome) and set out on your adventure alone or with up to four other players. Battles are real-time and of the shooter variety, ie, rather than swing a sword, you fire knives (or spells depending on your class). Enemies respawn out of holes in the ground which must be eradicated to keep them from pouring forth in waves. There are a number of items to be found and used throughout the game including potions of white and black magic, healing drinks and the like, but unlike Gauntlet there is no food to worry about.</story>

    <story>Spectrum HoloByte&apos;s series of hardcore flight simulations makes its only appearance on a console with Falcon for TurboGrafx. Owing to the limited control options, the game is more action and less simulation, but still opts for a certain amount of realism. Players control an F-16 Falcon in combat against a terrorist group planning to construct a nuclear bomb. Before the main campaign, several training scenarios allow the practice of bombing ground targets, intercepting bombers, engaging in dogfights and facing flak guns or SAM sites. The same kinds of scenarios are faced in the campaign. Before taking off, players can outfit their plane with the correct weapons for the mission at hand, including various realistic models of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and bombs as well as ECM pods and extra fuel tanks. Takeoffs and landings are taken care of automatically. Gameplay is seen through a cockpit perspective patterned after a real F-16, with the environment and air and ground targets rendered as flat-shaded polygons. The directional pad is used to steer the plane, Select to change weapons and Button II to fire. Button I is a multi-purpose button that changes the functions of the other buttons, allowing the pilot to set the throttle, bank, shift the radar lock, and fire countermeasures. Realistic features during flight include red and blackouts, and of course, stalls and crashes. The game features a high score table and saves mission progress via passwords (or to battery-backed RAM with a Turbo Booster Plus). A unique feature is a head-to-head mode supported on TurboExpress handhelds via Turbo Link cable.</story>

Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players. Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin. This is essentially a racing RPG. You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion. To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car.

Galaga &apos;90 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds nicer graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements. Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature dancing enemies. The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. You can begin with 1 ship with 2 in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve). Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Some enemies explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that wiggle their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical eggs and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</story>

    <story>Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game. The year is 2089 and the setting is Earth’s moon, which yields many important resources. While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile). As commander of the Allied forces, it is the player’s responsibility to lead what’s left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth. There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through. In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp. There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions. Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.</story>

The unusual thing about the racing system is that the action always follows the leader.

Everyone who was invited to the wedding begins to celebrate when, suddenly, the evil Baron Bronsky appears and snatches Tina away, while his henchmen take the six children away. To reach his castle and rescue Tina, Master Higgins must first rescue the six children, each of whom is hidden on a separate island. New Adventure Island is a one-player action game that consists of seven areas, with four rounds each. In order to get through the areas, you must use your hatchet to destroy wildlife such as frogs, spiders, birds, snails, insects, and other pests, and watch out for hazards such as rocks, fire, water, and pits. As you progress further, your vitality will get low, so fruit must be collected in order to restore it. Along the way, you can smash open eggs that will award you with better weapons that include boomerangs, arrows, and magical fire. Some of the eggs will also reveal a fairy, which will protect you from getting hit. If you are unlucky enough to find an eggplant hidden in one of these eggs, your vitality will drain away very fast, and you need to get fruit every five seconds in order to survive. When you get to the end of an area, you will have to defeat one of the henchmen and rescue a child from one of the four castles. An update of the original NES game.</story>

    <story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot &apos;em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called The Force, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger&apos;s artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot&apos;em&apos;ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type&apos;s contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

Raiden (called Raiden Trad on the Genesis and SNES) is an over-head vertical-scrolling shooter, based on an arcade game of the same title. It features two forms of weapon upgrades and two types of missiles (normal or homing). You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</story>

Both cyborgs have traded their energy blades for ranged attacks, which change the pacing of the game a bit but nevertheless remains an action-oriented side-scrolling platformer in which your objective is to clear the stage of all enemies and bosses, while picking up any power-ups that can aid you in your quest. The game makes a linear progression from stage to stage, losing the world map from the original as well as the upgrade buying between levels (since Doc the inventor of both cyborgs and provider of upgrades has been abducted by the aliens), although new shooter stages have been included to spice things up.</story>

Single players also have to switch between the two athletes. However, each athlete has a n energy value which decreases over the course of a match. By using a water bottle the energy gets filled up again, but there is only a limited amount available.

    <story>Takin&apos; it to the Hoop is a basketball game with comic graphics. The player either participates in a league, play-offs or a single match and chooses one of eight American teams with twelve athletes. The team&apos;s performance during a match does not only depend on the player&apos;s ability but also on the athlethe&apos;s statistics (e.g. agility or dribbling) and their energy. Energy decreases during the course of a match and describes how much power an athlete has left. There are also three different defense tactics (one-on-one defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions. During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block the ball when the correct timing is met.</story>

    <story>Timeball is a puzzle game with similarities to sliding block puzzles. Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank. The goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.</story>

The other one shows the condition of the protective shields which are decreased by enemy hits. If it runs out, the robot loses a limb and associated systems, e.g. if the head is gone, the radar which shows the direction of incoming attacks goes with it. If all limbs are lost, the game is over. Defeating enemies rewards points which can be used to upgrade the robot&apos;s abilities between levels.</story>

    <story>Victory Run is an arcade racer based on the Paris-Dakar rally. The gameplay is similar to OutRun, with your car appearing near the bottom of the screen, and a course made of scaling sprites laid out ahead. At the start of the race, you choose how many spare engines, tires, brakes, and so on to take with you on the rally. As you finish each segment, you have to decide to use those parts so that you can repair your car so you can complete the race.</story>

    <story>World Class Baseball is a baseball game. The player controls the pitcher and fielders (through an automatic system that, following baseball games&apos; tradition, gives to him control on the one of the players who is closest to the ball); not the batter. One or two little windows display the runner&apos;s status during the face-off between the batter and the pitcher; once the ball is hit the view changes to a bird&apos;s eye one, showing a good portion of the game field where the action is taking place, together with a permanent small field&apos;s image at the right bottom of the screen displaying the position of every player on the whole field). This game comprises an arcade mode (namely «Pennant mode») in which the player is tasked with straightly defeating one by one all opponent teams; a two-player mode (Versus mode) where two players just play versus each other in a single game, the «Open mode» to challenge the computer in a single match and a computer-only mode (Watch mode), seeing a challenge between two teams both controlled by the CPU. The Edit mode allows the player to change the starting lineup and starting rotation for the team. The teams are bracketed in two groups: South Division (consisting of teams from Bangkok, Beijing, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Sidney); North Division (counting teams based in Chicago, Los Angeles, London, New York, Tokyo, Toronto). No official licensed baseball teams are there. </story>

    <story>World Court Tennis is a tennis game with a twist. The action itself features no big surprises: the players control their characters over the scrolling tennis field and try to counter balls from their opponents. It is possible to perform typical tennis actions like cross, smash or lob and the hit performance depends on the timing. However, the unique feature of this game is a story mode which takes various elements from Japanese role-playing games. The story involves an evil king who banned all tennis matches outside of membership courts. The player goes out to overthrow the king so tennis can be brought back to everyone. So the player explores a top-down world map reminiscent of Dragon Warrior, explores the surrounding and fights enemies. Those fights are either random encounters or scripted boss battles and play out as regular tennis matches. The overall goal is to find all membership courts and defeat the inhabitants. Because of this, the game does not end when defeated; the player gets dragged to the king and has to pay a penalty fee. Money is the only resource and is earned by defeating enemies. It is used to buy updated equipment: shoes improve speed, rackets improve power and shirts help to evade random encounters. The game is no RPG, however, because there is no actual character development.</story>

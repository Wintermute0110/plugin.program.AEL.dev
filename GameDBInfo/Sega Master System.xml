    <story>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility. By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding. There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible. Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</story>

    <story>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time. The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</story>

The player controls Aladdin, making his way through a variety of locations, including the streets of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan&apos;s palace and more. Gameplay takes several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.</story>

    <story>A new arcade has hit town, and Alex and his friends decide to check it out. Sadly, they have no idea where it is, so it&apos;s up to Alex to find the eight map pieces cleverly hidden inside the castle. Getting all the pieces is only the start, he must then fight his way through a forest filled with ninja assassins, enter town to do required tasks, obtain a travel pass, then get through a second forest filled with other nasties. The question is: will Alex make his way to the arcades before 17:00? Alex Kidd: High-Tech World allows you to resume a saved game. All you have to do is enter a password, and the game will be resumed right where you left off. The game is time-based, and events can only happen at certain times. For instance, certain characters will appear when thirty minutes of each hour is up. During the game, you can access a status screen, which helps you keep track of the time, what floor you&apos;re on, and how many map pieces you collected so far. There are six floors inside the castle, including the attic. On some floors, there are phones which you can use to either to ask a character for help, or order a pizza. There are also alternate solutions to some puzzles in the game. The demo at the start of the game may give away one of the map pieces.</story>

Once again you play Alex, whose mission is to run through each location, knocking down enemies, and obtain the six miracle balls. These balls are hidden inside the strangest places like golden eggs, the Fantazy Zone ship out of action, clamshells, Christmas presents, pumpkins, and desk bells. Alex must then venture in outer space to defeat the evil Ziggurat. Locations include Toy World, Machine World, the World of Make Believe, Water World, and Monster World. You will even tour through the giant&apos;s body. Once you obtained the six miracle balls, you have to run through all the locations again, but these repeated locations introduce new enemies. With all the locations, you&apos;re under a time limit, and as usual, if the time expires, you lose a life. Alex starts the game with nothing, but during the game, he can collect power-ups that give him extra time, and allow him to shoot enemies or jump higher.</story>

    <story>Many centuries ago, on the planet Aries, there lived a boy called Alex Kidd. For seven years, he lived on Mt. Eternal studying Shellcore, an ancient art that makes one strong enough to break rocks into pieces. As he was leaving the mountain one day to travel to his spiritual homeland, a dying man told him that the peaceful city of Radactian was in grave danger. Before taking his last breath, the man gave Alex a piece of a map and a medallion made of Sun Stone. There are eleven locations in which Alex must explore, each of them has its own unique dangers. In each location, Alex can collect bags of coins, which can be used to buy items at the shop and are used to help Alex get through each location (eg: motorcycle, peticopter, power bracelet, etc.) There are also traps that Alex must avoid like the ghost that chases him. He can also collect the Telepathy Ball that will help him read people&apos;s minds. Later, Alex learns that in order to save Radactian from destruction, he must first defeat Janken the Great, Emperor of the planet Janbarik (he got his name from his expertise at the game of Janken -- or what people call scissors, paper, stone in the Western World. Janken has sent his henceman all over Radactian to prepare the game for Alex as he passes by them. In order to get past them, Alex must win three times at Janken. If he loses, he is turned to stone and vanished from Radactian forever. Later on in the game, Alex must play with the same henceman, but only this time, when Alex wins, they decide to play dirty. Alex uses his fists to wipe out some of Janken&apos;s enemies such as birds, sea horses, bats, monkeys, frogs, and a few others. If his quest to save Radactian from the evil hands of Janken becomes difficult, he can instead use the power bracelet to perform the Shocking Waves of Destruction, an ancient trick in the art of Shellcore. Before Alex comes face-to-face with Janken, he should rescue his brother, Egle, from imprisonment, and get the letter and two medallions.</story>

He must go through each level defeating ninjas and other wildlife. In the last levels, he must defeat bosses including Kabuto, Heli, Robster, and Hanzo. To survive some levels, you must learn the secret jumping technique, described on page eight of the game&apos;s instruction manual. You start the game with three lives and are presented with an energy bar with three units, but you&apos;ll lose one if an enemy touches you. Furthermore, If you lose all three energy units, you lose a life, and if you lose all three lives, the game is over. Additional energy units can be obtained by collecting hearts that can be found by breaking treasure chests. The maximum units you can get is six. From there, the heart is replaced by a mini-Alex. Collect this and you&apos;ve earned yourself an extra life. You&apos;ll get hearts if you have less than six units. You can also get weapons like spears and power swords by breaking these treasure cheats. However, if you&apos;re lucky, you can obtain a Tornado icon, letting you transform into a tornado while mini-Tornados whirl around the screen, seeking enemies. This allows you to either go left or right so your enemies get sucked in and are knocked out.</story>

    <story>The aliens are invading Earth, and it&apos;s up to the Alien Busters to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks. When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you&apos;ll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO. When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you&apos;re dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character&apos;s special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can&apos;t use it. At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</story>

In the levels that follow the shooting range, you must kill robots that appear and attack you. If you are hit by these robots, some of your energy will be lost. Occasionally, shooting the power-ups that appear will result in more weapon power or more life. At the end of each level, you need to defeat a boss in order to proceed to the next level. The game ends when you lose all of your energy. You have unlimited continues, however. Assault City comes in two flavors: the control pad version, as well as a Light Phaser version.</story>

    <story>The Romans, who fail to conquer one final Gaul village, kidnap Getafix, the druid brewing the magic potion that gives all the inhabitants supernatural strength. Vitalstatistix, the village chief, orders Asterix and Obelix to find him, keep him out of Caesar&apos;s hands and bring him back at any cost. In seven rounds, you can play either with Asterix or Obelix, and in the bonus stages (accessible when you collect fifty bones in a single round), you control the little Dogmatix. The heroes can jump, punch, swim, throw obstacles, grab vines or ropes and they have distinct moves. Obelix moves slower, but is able to manipulate objects, while Asterix has much more speed. Both characters can be played alternately according to the level. In the two-player mode, you each choose a character and clear areas in turns. Aside from the traditional moves, there are special potions that melt ice, create makeshift bridges or blow up blocks. The game contains many familiar characters and scenery from the comic books.</story>

In this side-scrolling action game, the player can choose to play either Astérix or Obelix at the start of each one of the six levels. Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Astérix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Astérix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Obélix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them). Astérix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.</story>

    <story>Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but depicted using sprites rather than polygons. There are three main modes: 1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race followed by three laps. 2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist. There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too many objects or other cars frequently. 3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or wet, only on some circuits). While each mode presents it&apos;s own variations, the core of each race is the same: Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.</story>

The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie&apos;s most memorable scenes: 1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge. 2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty&apos;s girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence. 3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff&apos;s lackeys. 4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking. 5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</story>

Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they&apos;re soon deep in trouble when they face Mad Dog Tannen&apos;s gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences: 1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley&apos;s lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective. 2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets. 3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It&apos;s an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back. 4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</story>

When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won&apos;t score any points, but if you&apos;re too late, he&apos;ll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you&apos;re lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying I haven&apos;t got anything. That&apos;s when they will be replaced by bandits. Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there&apos;s more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you&apos;ll get three bags of gold coins. There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you&apos;re on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.</story>

    <story>The captain of the home town basketball team is leading his team to win the All-American Championships. But then the captain had a strange dream, nightmare in fact, where he was playing basketball against all these strange creatures in exotic locations. Basketball Nightmare is a basketball game where the player plays basketball against strange humanoid creatures on the court where the creature lives. The player must play and defeat each creature before moving onto a new place with a new harder opponent. The player starts of playing against Wolfs in the Forest and then, upon defeating that opponent, moves on to play Frogs at the Pond, One Eyed Aliens at the Waterfall, Vampires in the Skeleton Cave, Geishas in the Bamboo Forest, before finally playing against Samurais at the Shrine. If the player loses a match then that match can be replayed until won. The player at the start of each match gets to pick how long the match duration is out of the options of 15, 30, or 45 minutes (not in real time) before being placed on the court. When on the court the player always plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass. When defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the opponent to challenge for the ball. There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court. Also there are two more modes called CPU vs CPU, where the player can get the CPU to play itself and Versus Play to play against a friend. In both modes the player or players pick one of the 8 nations that are USA, CBA, CHN, JPN, URS, DDR, CAN, and FRN all with a character representing a player of that nation. All the rules are the same as single player mode.</story>

    <story>From Sega 8-bit specialists Aspect comes one of many adaptations of Tim Burton&apos;s 1992 superhero sequel Batman Returns. Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the Game Gear version, the Master System version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics. Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck&apos;s department store, the sewers, and the Penguin&apos;s lair. For the first four levels, a route can be selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game. Enemies standing in Batman&apos;s way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at them. At the beginning, the weapon&apos;s range is very limited, but it can be expanded by collecting powerups. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls. Unlike in the Game Gear version, there is no health bar: a single hit will kill Batman. To compensate, the game contains a generous amount of extra lives.</story>

The status display on the screen shows Harker&apos;s health bar, countdown timer to complete the level and currently held weapon. Throughout the levels question mark boxes (similar to the Mario games) can be found, attacking these will reveal power ups which include health restoration, timer increase and new weapons. Among these new weapons are axes, daggers and a shotgun. Question mark boxes can also be used as platforms to reach other areas and enemies. Each stage is divided into two sections: the Daytime and the Nighttime. These are entirely different levels comparable to stage 1-a and 1-b. Harker must jump to various platforms and obstacles and defeat minor enemies throughout the levels. The end of a Nighttime level is usually guarded by a boss creature who must be defeated to progress.</story>

    <story>Bubble Bobble is the story of two humans, Bub and Bob who wander into the mysterious cave of monsters and magically turn into dinosaurs. The only way to transform back is to reach the end of the cave... Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they&apos;ll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</story>

    <story>In Captain Silver, you play the role of Jim, a brave young lad with a taste of adventure. You embark on a journey to find Captain Silver&apos;s secret treasure hoard, which is rumored to be hidden on an island in the Eastern Seas. There are six scenes in the game. During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands. In each of these six scenes, Jim must use his sword to kill cats, rats, bats, witches, skeletons, and other creatures that are waiting for him. When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word CAPTAIN SILVER. If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life. Jim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the clock power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the boot power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the coffee? power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one. There is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.</story>

    <story>Sega&apos;s 8-bit systems received their own version of the Genesis&apos; popular Disney platformer. Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and slightly different gameplay mechanics. To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow in order to confront and defeat the witch. Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and throwing them at the enemies. Mickey&apos;s ability to pick up things and carry them around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or coins to collect for points.</story>

Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married. Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck&apos;s abilities and kidnaps him. Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad! The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</story>

    <story>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up &apos;combos&apos; - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines. As well as the normal game mode, there is also a &apos;flash&apos; mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</story>

    <story>It is the year 2242. You are Paladin, the galaxy&apos;s toughest bounty hunter. Cyborgs are about to take complete control of the universe under the direction of Vipron, their evil leader. You are sent to the cyborg fortress to get rid of all the chief cyborgs in each of the seven areas. The game screen is divided into three sections. This includes a first-person view of the map, in which you can see objects that are coming your way. There are two types of objects: red objects indicate the lower cyborgs, while white ones indicate the chief cyborgs. Next to it is a map of the area, your life and psycho power count. Below these is the action screen. In each of these seven areas, there are several floors which can be reached via the elevator. At the beginning of the game, your only weapons are your fists, but weapons can be collected throughout each area, which include psycho punch, ray gun, light gun, and bombs. Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can also be collected. If you use the psycho punch or psycho gun, your psycho power gets depleted, and when it is empty, you must stock up on some more. You can also get shields that will protect you from laser beams, and jet engines so that you can fly over hazards. In some areas, you defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which you can use to access other areas of the fortress. Some chief cyborgs are easy to kill, while some are hard. You will just have to work out which weapon works best with them. The game ends when you lose all your life. You are not alone in this mission. You also have Adina, your contact back at headquarters. Follow her instructions carefully and you may survive. Cyborg Hunter is based on the Japanese-only Borgman.</story>

    <story>The Looney Tunes platformer Daffy Duck in Hollywood received a unique version for Sega&apos;s 8-bit systems. While similar in story, concept and themes to the Mega Drive version, the 8-bit version has unique level designs and also several differences in gameplay. Players control Daffy Duck, who is hired to reacquire Yosemite Sam&apos;s Golden Cartoon Movie Awards, stolen by the nefarious Doctor Duck Brain. Daffy has to make his way through six different worlds of three levels each. Each world is based on a movie genre including western, horror, adventure, sci-fi and more. At the beginning of the game, the six levels of the first two worlds can be selected in any order. Completing all six unlocks the levels of the next two worlds. Each level consists of several sections. The entry to the next section only opens once Daffy has dispatched a number of enemies in the current section. To to so, Daffy is armed with a bubble gun. Shooting bubbles at enemies makes most of them float away, some however are invulnerable and must be avoided. Daffy can upgrade his gun via bubble power-ups, making it shoot faster, in different patterns or with more power. Also available are magic wand power-ups which summon a fairy duck mother, preventing Daffy from losing a life by absorbing the next hit - otherwise, each hit is instantly fatal. Golden clipboards give continues while dollar signs, gold coins and diamonds can be collected for points. Not every level contains one of the Movie Awards, and collecting them isn&apos;t even necessary to finish the game. Yosemite Sam won&apos;t be pleased however if not all are recovered.</story>

    <story>Long ago, in the distant land of Moralos, in a time when vast jungles still covered the Earth, an evil presence emerged from its tomb beneath the ground. His name was Gilbas, and he was about to destroy the inhabitants of the land. Aganan, a great warrior, was summoned to save the troubled land and put an end to Gilbas by sealing him in the tome from where it came. Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan, was called. His quest is to locate the three sacred objects that Aganan used to defeat Gilbas: The Orb of Light, The Amulet of Light, and The Knife of Light. There are about four rounds to complete, and has Danan going through exotic locations defeating enemies such as valkyries, ogres, bees, spiders, and several others. At the end of each round, you come face to face with a boss, which takes quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are likely to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to the story is then revealed. Assisting you with your journey are three animals: an eagle, a monkey, and some other animal that I am unfamiliar with. To get these animals to help you, however, you will need to collect three of their tokens that are found in yellow chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for example, can get a hold of you and fly you to safety if more than one type of enemy surrounds you. Anyway, you can get these animals to help you at any place, at any time, as long as you have three of its tokens. Yellow chests can also reveal extra strength, extra time, or extra health. The game ends when you run out of time, or when you lose your health, and there are no second chances, unless you manage to find some elixirs, which are rare.</story>

This is a platform shooter/beat-&apos;em-up game. Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him. Since he can&apos;t approach enemies who attack from the depth of the screen, he can dispose of them using his machine gun. When the enemy is too close, Dick will punch him instead of shooting.</story>

    <story>Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.</story>

    <story>Side-scrolling beat &apos;em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples. Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca&apos;s clutches.</story>

You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.

    <story>Sega decided to make their last game in the Fantasy Zone series different. You see, the gameplay now involves you going around mazes, collecting all the dots while avoiding enemies. You are awarded points for each dot collected, but they vary depending on their size. For example, small dots award ten points each, while you get 200 points for each larger dot you collect. Once you have collected all the dots in the maze, the enemies will turn into coins, which you must quickly get in a strict time limit and you move on to the next maze. Just before this, though, you get a statistics screen that shows the amount of time that you spent in the maze. Points are also awarded, but sadly, if you spent over sixty seconds in a maze, you won&apos;t get any. Every world you travel to consist of three mazes, and after you complete all three, a bonus round appears where the object is to collect all coins before time expires. While you are collecting the dots in the normal mazes, you must touch the enemy&apos;s energy, a flashing red spot within each maze to avoid 2nd-generation enemies from entering the mazes. Some power-ups can be collected, which consist of weapons and speed boosters (big wings), which can be collected by landing on the circle which it is in. However, you need money in form of the amount outlined just before each maze. If you land on a circle while you are short of cash, a &apos;NO SELLING&apos; sign will appear above it, and you have to collect some more dots and try again. Also you can die by touching an enemy. When you die, a coin will take you place, and when you get resurrected, you can grab the coin. The game can be played with two players, but the same rule applies in a 2-player game.</story>

    <story>Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa is the sequel to Fantasy Zone, in which you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row. More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a &apos;stop&apos; sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).</story>

    <story>The Flash is a side-scrolling platformer starring the eponymous D.C. comics hero. The game is divided into six rounds, each round has two stages and a boss fight. Within each stage, Flash must get to the exit before the time limit runs out, though the exit must first be unlocked by activating a switch. Apart from a speedy protagonist, the game has some similarities to Sonic the Hedgehog, as the levels have a similarly complex structure with different passages and many optional areas. While Flash moves very fast in general, he can also move with even higher SuperSpeed, but only as long as the necessary SuperSpeed energy is not drained. The energy is also used for performing vibrating attacks and can be recharged by at Star Food vendors scattered in the levels. Vibrating attacks can be used to destroy blocks (which contain either traps or power-ups) and to get rid of bad guys. For the latter, Flash also has a spin attack. He can use it only while moving, but no energy is required.</story>

Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling with his friend and neighbor Barney. Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping. And if that&apos;s not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over. The Flintstones game is divided in four parts. Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room. To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again. Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center. Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling alley! Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks! And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance. Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney. At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player. Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game takes ten turns. while a match takes three games. Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site. On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared! Don&apos;t let Wilma find that out! Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.

It confiscates a horde of planes and warships, and as a UN loyalist, it is your job to shoot them down. Solving starvation and disease can wait, apparently. The game is split into 8 stages, which are split into sub-stages over land and sea, each of which has a strict time limit, and a target number of planes to shoot down. They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.</story>

To fight them, you have a vulcan as well as an undepletable stock of missiles. Once you have fought your way across the planet, you enter a tunnel system in the inner confines of the planet. As the tunnel turns, you are given directions as to which way you must manoeuvre, but the narrow tunnel gives you little space to take evasive action.

Thor the Warrior, has a bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts. Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route. Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.

    <story>The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman&apos;s KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James &apos;Buster&apos; Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different. Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury&apos;s points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected. Each match the player&apos;s boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.</story>

You&apos;ll have to ward off or destroy everything that gets in your way -- no matter how grotesque it appears. Furthermore, you&apos;ll have to keep punching your way through the mansion until you find the secret key. You then have to use it to open one of the five coffins, defeat Dracula, capture the jewel he drops, and make your way out of the mansion. You play the role of Mick, and everything is going to stop you from completing these tasks and making you way out of the mansion. You just have to punch, or jump on, your enemies to defeat them. And arrows will be flying from either direction and will attempt to hit you on the head, and you must either duck or jump on them for extra points. You can jump or touch lights to freeze everything on screen for a few seconds. Rather than punching, you can collect a sword on the lower level by jumping on it as it flies past you. The sword is useful when you fight Dracula or getting rid of Fire Blowers. You start the game with three lives, and receive an additional life every 50,000 and 150,000 points. You also have an energy meter. You lose energy when you touch one of the monsters. When you run out of energy, you lose a life. You gain energy by collecting treasures scattered throughout the mansion, and it is restored when you kill a Dracula.</story>

    <story>Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will bust any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated proton packs and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer. Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for ghost alarms as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away. As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</story>

    <story>Golden Axe Warrior is a spin-off of the Golden Axe games, a series of side-scrolling Beat&apos;Em Ups from Sega. In ancient times a horde of giants rebelled against the elders and a brutal war ensued. Things looked grave until finally a hero, carrying the Golden Axe, appeared and drove back the giants. Since then, the kingdom of Firewood has been ruled by a family that had mastered the power of the nine crystals to ward off all evil from Firewood. Everyone lived in peace until one of Firewood&apos;s ministers betrayed his king and sold the nine crystals to Death Adder, one of the evil giants. Death Adder has hidden the nine crystals in nine dungeons, has unleashed hordes of monsters and is threatening to take over the world. Will there be another hero who can find the Golden Axe and defeat Death Adder? Gameplay in Golden Axe Warrior is very similar to The Legend Of Zelda, meaning you will spend most of your time exploring the large overworld fighting against lots of enemies and looking for the dungeons in which the crystals are hidden. Inside the dungeons you have to fight more enemies, find treasures and keys, solve simple puzzles and defeat the dungeon&apos;s boss to get one of the crystals. In order to survive against the large number of enemies, you will be able to find many different weapons and three different spells.</story>

    <story>Golfamania is a golfing simulation game where players play on an 18 hole golf course with all the rules and scoring like in the real game. Within the game there are 4 different modes to play on that includes Practice, Match Play, Stroke Play, and Pro Tournament. In Practice a single player can play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player mode against human or computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1 computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different areas that are power, accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is where the player plays against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the objective to score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf). Based on performance the player can earn experience points (XP) that they can use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for future tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like ‘longest drive’ and ‘hole in one’ awards that can earn bonus XP. Regardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player selects a character (the selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the character by naming and picking their style. In all modes but Practice the player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17 different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter). When playing the player is presented with a top down view where the player lines up the shot and the location on the golf ball they want to hit (for spin). Then the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are presented with a power bar that has a marker that going is up and down along it. The player must stop the marker on the red area in the centre of the power bar to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed the ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good hit). The amount of red that is on the power bar depends on the golf club used. To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered in exchange for a lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful for putter shots). The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.</story>

    <story>GP Rider is an arcade like motorcycle racing game that players can race in all the tracks of all the 15 tracks of the 1989 Motorcycle Grand Prix. There is also an extra Arcade track for the player to race on. There are 3 modes of play that are Arcade, Tournament, and Grand Prix. In Arcade the player races on only 1 track that is named Arcade. In Tournament players get to choose any number of tracks to race, from 0 (which defaults to the Arcade track) to all 15 available tracks. Grand Prix is where the player races in all 15 tracks in order of the 1989 season. All races regardless of the mode played in the same way. The game is played on a split screen even if only one player is playing. A CPU character named Wayne controls the bike on the top screen if there is no other player playing. Wayne races like a real player would, having both good and bad races and occasionally making mistakes. The race is made up of a Qualify to determine gird position and then the Race where the player races 15 other races (including Wayne) over a predefined number of laps depending on track length. The track can raced in ether the wet or the dry (only dry in Arcade mode) and the weather can change from the Qualify to the Race. The races take place on flat roads with straights and curves simulating the layout of the real track. On the bike there is a fuel gage that simply counts down the seconds left of fuel and is automatically refilled at the completion of each lap. If the player doesn’t complete the lap before time runs out then the player will “Out of Fuel” and end the race in the placed down with other non-finishers. At the end of each race (accept in Arcade mode) the player will get points depending on there position before going onto the next race. The player sets up the bike with some basic set ups that are all available from the start. In Arcade mode the player has the options of an Automatic or Manual gearbox with either High Gearing (better top speed) or Low Gearing (better acceleration). In Tournament and Grand Prix modes the options are extended to Engine type of Lean, Medium, and Thirsty which progressively adds speed while cutting the time available per lap. There is gearing that works the same as Arcade mode, and a tyre type of wet and dry depending on the weather.</story>

The player is cast as James Douglas to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. The boxers are shown from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury&apos;s points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected. Each match the player&apos;s boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics.

    <story>Joe Montana (Joe Cool) was an American National Football League player playing for the San Francisco 49ers as a quarterback. He was voted by the Associated Press as the most valuable player two years running (1989-90). In Joe Montana Football the player can play a game of American Football with Joe Montana giving the player basic tips on the next best move. The player can play against a friend or play the computer with 3 difficulty levels (beginner, normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the real rules and scoring. The teams are made up of 28 American city names with no team names (or player names) mentioned. Once the coin is flipped and the kick-off the game begins. The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen where the player can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done in full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours). More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it will default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected receiver. Two player mode works the same as single player but with a player instead of the computer.</story>

    <story>This 8-bit adaptation of Disney&apos;s 1967 animated film Jungle Book is slightly different from the other versions. Although most of the main elements remain the same, the most noticeable differences are in level design and some missing items. The player controls Mowgli in his journey to the human village. Mowgli will swing on and climb vines, run and jump while facing enemies such as coconut-throwing monkeys, snakes and vampire bats. To fight them, Mowgli can throw bananas in eight directions. He&apos;ll also find upgrades and weapons such as boomerangs inside banana bunches. There are some boss fights with main characters of the movie, such as the snake Kaa. The objective of each of the 10 time-limited levels (or scenes) is to collect gems scattered around them. Collecting certain amounts of gems grant access to bonus levels. The player starts the game with 4 lives and 1 continue.</story>

    <story>One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega&apos;s 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels. In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows. After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight. The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.</story>

If Hayato comes in contact with a monster, he will lose some life. At the end of each level, you will have to fight a warlock or one of their henchmen. More often than not, there is a hut with a sealed door, but the door is not unlocked unless a warlock or henceman is defeated. You gain a new special power whenever you recover a scroll from them. These special powers range from high jumping to the ability to whirl your sword around like a windmill.</story>

His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba&apos;s father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return. The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &amp;quot;roar meter&amp;quot; to charge. As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you&apos;re skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</story>

To pass the three tests, Landau must find the Tree of Marill, subdue the Goblin of Balala Valley, and destroy the Statue Of Evil. Landau is controlled in a 3rd-person side-scrolling view. He can explore the world map (which can be seen by pressing the pause button) freely in a non linear way, but some portions of the map will be available only after defeating certain enemies or getting certain items. The Kingdom of Baljinya has towns and villages where Landau can stop to rest (restoring his health) and gather information from the people. There are also castles which can only be entered after completing certain tasks. Between those villages, towns and castles lie different kinds of terrains, like flatlands, dark forests, mountains and swamps. Those terrains are plagued by different kinds of monsters, some specific of each terrain. There are two weapons which can be used by Landau: a sword and a bow. The sword can be used by pressing the button 2 while standing, kneeling or jumping. The bow can be used by pressing the button 1 only when standing or kneeling. Landau cannot walk and attack at the same time. Along his way he&apos;ll find new and stronger swords and bows. Landau has only one life, but the game offers a continue feature which can be used up to 10 times.</story>

Mr. Big has kidnapped the children and has nasty things in store for them, like drugging them and making them slaves. It&apos;s up to Michael to use his powers and save his little friends. Michael Jackson (MJ) can jump, throw magical stars, and dance to counter his opponents as he looks for the hidden children. Stages come in shape of some of MJ&apos;s videos like streets and graveyards.</story>

    <story>If you&apos;re bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on. These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework. Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life. The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.</story>

You start your quest by yourself, but you must find three other companions who will join you to defeat Terarin. You also must venture through five lands. You will find villages, towns and castles in your travels in these lands. In each, you will find or be able to buy weapons and armor (both for you and your companions), medicine and...clues. You will also find caves, dungeons, and monuments that are scattered. Some you may enter unhindered. Others will be locked...until you find the right person or learn the right spell. Also within each land, you will encounter monsters such as evil merchants, Weasly wimps, Unmutaks, Great Lions, Gelfises, Zirods, and many more. Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters. However, not all inhabitants are monsters. You will also meet merchants and travelers who might tell you where to go and what to do.</story>

    <story>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung&apos;s mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself. Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a Fatality on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale. Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game&apos;s fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</story>

    <story>In 1982, a sequel to the incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man. This sequel continued on the eat the dots/avoid the ghosts gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh. Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics. One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&apos;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again. Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of Junior.</story>

    <story>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. If Tiki doesn&apos;t rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</story>

    <story>The Master System version of Ninja Gaiden is not a port of the well-known NES game, but an entirely new game (this includes both a different story and different levels) developed by SIMS under license from Tecmo. The story is also about the original protagonist, the Dragon ninja Ryu Hayabusa, who returns to his clan&apos;s village only to find it utterly destroyed and the inhabitants murdered. A single survivor tells Ryu in his last seconds that the Sacred Scroll of Bushido was stolen. With the power of the scroll its owner is mighty enough the gain control of the whole world. Thus Ryu swears to recapture the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan. The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat&apos;em up title and incorporates most of the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword. Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected. However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and forth between two close walls to get higher and higher. The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which continues the story about Ryu&apos;s quest for the Bushido scroll and his revenge.</story>

Gyokuro, an evil emperor, gained power and his oppressive rule caused great hardship to the people, and the princess who opposed him was confined to a dungeon somewhere in the Ohkami castle. Gyokuro has the Ohkami ninja under control at his command. Utilizing various ninjitsu techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people who are his enemies. You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the princess. However, he can&apos;t rescue the princess unless he finds the five scrolls in the thirteen areas of Ohkami. On his quest, he must defeat various ninjas such as Kuno-ichi and Ninniku, as well as fire-blowing ninjas, slashing ninjas, and footloose ninjas. You&apos;ll explore grassy fields, shrines, river banks, towns, and the castle itself. Some of the steps have varied gameplay. For example, you must avoid boulders in Step 2, must use logs in order to cross a river in Step 5, avoid being trampled on by horses in Step 7, and scale a cliff in Step 9.</story>

Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It&apos;s possible to watch the other semi-final. Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds. The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it&apos;s own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).</story>

Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to pick them up. Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You&apos;ll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it&apos;s not beneficial.

    <story>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It&apos;s an ordinary evening, and Bruno&apos;s dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno&apos;s vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father&apos;s pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it&apos;s up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids&apos; eyes - and rescue his dad! The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno&apos;s primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno&apos;s special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno&apos;s score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.</story>

    <story>The third game in the OutRun series, which revolutionised the third-person perspective style of racing games. The levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike in the predecessors, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the roads are dogged with other cars to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music.</story>

    <story>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</story>

The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy &apos;links&apos; course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green. When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</story>

    <story>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest. To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god. Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same. When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy&apos;s people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won&apos;t stop until they&apos;re all dead... or he is. But you don&apos;t have to let your people have all the fun; the god&apos;s have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers. Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn&apos;t build on high-ground. And when you win, you&apos;ll have 500 more worlds to conquer. A god&apos;s play is just never done.</story>

Once you have defeated each enemy target, the mission is completed, and, upon completing some of them, your rank increases. Before defeating each target, however, you also need to destroy enemy jets, choppers, and submarines who will launch missiles or rockets at you. If you are hit by any of these, damage is inflicted to the submarine, but you can shoot down any of the missiles or rockets. You will need to keep an eye on the built-in radar and sonar to find out where enemies will hit next. Your fuel is limited, and can be increased by destroying certain enemies. The game ends when your submarine is destroyed or you run out of fuel.</story>

Blast the enemy in the air and and on the ground and save the planet from the creeping green menace. There are six rounds to complete (three in the mobile version). In each round, numbers (from 1 to 8) can be found on the ground either enclosed by a ring, or in the air carried by a ship. Getting these numbers will upgrade your firepower. Get more of the same number for a maximum upgrade. Unfortunately, whatever the type of firepower you get, you will have a limited supply of ammo, so you need to stock up on the same type of firepower if you get too low. At the end of each round, there is an end-of-round boss which involves shooting parts of its base in order to destroy it. Intermediate bosses can be found in the last three rounds (console version only).</story>

    <story>Psycho Fox is a platform game where you play a fox and you must get through seven worlds, consisting of three areas each. At the end of each world, there are one of seven bosses waiting to destroy you, but some of the later bosses are exactly the same as the earlier ones. The title is a bit misleading because you can also play as three other characters including Hippo, Leopard, and Monkey Boy. Each character has their own disadvantages. For example, Hippo is much slower than the other three. However, all the characters share one thing in common: they can use their fists and punch enemies as they approach them. They can also jump on them and keep knocking them in the ground until they disappear off the face of the earth. If they don&apos;t make them disappear, they will pop back out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each area, including spikes, cannonballs, esculators, fireballs, and steam. You start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life. Lose any of your lives, and the game is over. If the game is over, you can continue where you left off. There are several items to find, and these can help you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these eggs, either the switch item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you&apos;re lucky enough, a white bag is also revealed, but more often than not, one of your enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal a bird which you can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it hinders your progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can also be used as a backup, meaning that you can have enemies touching you, but it is the bird that is killed, not you. There is little chance that you&apos;ll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go up into a secret area, which can often be found if you jump on springs that are scattered throughout the level. These white bags are useless, until you get to the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you&apos;ve collected throughout each area. When you complete Psycho Fox, you are treated to a funny ending.</story>

    <story>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot &apos;em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay. You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire. The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called The Force, which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements). The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger&apos;s artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot&apos;em&apos;ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type&apos;s contemporary rival, Gradius.</story>

    <story>A vertical-scrolling shooter in the tradition of Commando, Ikari Warriors, and Guerrilla War. Rambo and his buddy Zane (who didn&apos;t appear in the movie) are charged with blasting their way through various levels and rescuing the hostages. Of course, it won&apos;t be easy -- soldiers, tanks, and other enemies will do everything they can to stop you from saving the day. Unlike Ocean&apos;s later First Blood License, a single hit kills you, and your weapon is a gun rather than knives. The game is in fact a re-branding of Ashura (known as Secret Commando in Europe), which explains why there is a second character on offer.</story>

    <story>Play as Rambo in this light phaser friendly game. Battle your way through Afghanistan in a solo rescue mission. You are fighting alone for two reasons. One being the C.I.A. doesn&apos;t want to stir up a war, two being your Rambo! Your mission is to rescue your comrade Colonel Trautman from the Soviets. He was taken in as prisoner while he was delivering weapons to the Mujahedin freedom fighters. He is being held captive in a prison camp. For weapons you have an AK-47 and grenades. You can pick up grenades by blasting open containers such as pots and crates. Use your fire-power to destroy all enemies and you will continue to the next stage. The first stage is a Soviet army base packed with plenty soldiers. The next stage is a village where the soviets are hiding. Then the rest of the levels are Mountain, Prison Camp, Soviet camp (escape during night), Cave attack, then the final stage where you fight the Mil Hind Helicopter.</story>

There are four modes in the game: Exhibition, Tournament, Watch Mode, and finally a Home Run Contest. In the Watch Mode the computer just plays against itself, and in Tournament Mode you compete against the computer. The other two modes can be played against computer or a human opponent as well. You can choose Major League Baseball teams in all of those modes. During the game, the player controls the pitcher and the batter from a third-person view; the view changes to top-down after a strike by a batter, so that the player can view a large part of the field. Events such as injuries or cheerleader performances are graphically shown in the game.</story>

    <story>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows. By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you&apos;re knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race. Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</story>

    <story>Play as Rocky Balboa, the Italian Stallion in this action packed boxing game. This game reflects the Rocky series quite well. Only in this game you go one guy to the next. From Apollo the remaining champion, to Lang an aggressive contender, to Drago the Soviet boxer who trains constantly. Before you have a fight just like in the Rocky movies you have to train. Practice your timing and punching strength with some sandbag punching before fighting Apollo. Warm up punching a punching ball to become more faster and smarter to get ready for Lang. Then you will do some punching mitts training before fighting Drago where you watch the mitts and punch at the as they move. All of these trainings have qualifications such as punches per second, qualify and your combinations get better for the following fight. During a fight you only have one meter under your name, that is the power meter. Your opponent has one likewise. Watching your power bar can tell you a lot about which way the fight is headed, either it&apos;s full and you can take more punches and punch more powerfully or it&apos;s low and you&apos;re in trouble. Watching the opponents power bar will tell you when to take him down or when to block. Between rounds you get a chance to freshen up and get some last minute coaching. During the one minute interval, your power will go up only half of what has been drained. If you do happen to take a fall the controls are similar to Nintendos Punch out, basically you just press the 1 and 2 buttons as fast as possible. Hopefully Rocky stands up and is ready for more.</story>

Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.</story>

He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man&apos;s body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard. Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the very challenging and the impossible. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</story>

    <story>Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield. On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough proof of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won&apos;t be easy since the Space Mutants are using human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs. The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar. Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.</story>

    <story>This game is actually a compilation of smaller games belonging to different genres. Krusty the clown appears in the beginning of the game and presents a menu with five games to play (one of which is not available from the start): A jump-and-run game, where Bart must find an exit on a ship, while enemies fire at him and try to prevent him from reaching the exit; a card game, where you have five tries to find hidden cards on a board; a simple jigsaw puzzle; a series of trivia questions concerning the Simpsons; and finally, a platform-skateboard game (available only after you have completed the ship level). Needless to say all games are connected to the famous TV series The Simpsons.</story>

    <story>SEGA&apos;s mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut in a famous Genesis title, but Sega&apos;s 8-bit systems got their own version of the platformer, featuring the same story and gameplay style, but different levels. To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new. Enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic&apos;s spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik&apos;s hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.</story>

    <story>Coming back from the vacation Sonic took after foiling the plans of Dr Robotnik, he finds that Tails and all his other animal friends are missing. Sonic finds a letter waiting for him, that reads: Dear Sonic, Robotnik is back, and he&apos;s captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds. Robotnik made me write this. He says he&apos;s waiting for you, and he&apos;s created six really nasty robots in order to &apos;get rid of you once and for all.&apos; I don&apos;t know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful! Sincerely, Tails. That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again. The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn&apos;t accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.</story>

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM. On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare creatures descend upon their ships and bases. In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</story>

    <story>Space Harrier 3-D is more like Space Harrier 1 1/2. While it&apos;s not a direct sequel to Space Harrier, it was designed to take advantage of the 3-D glasses available at the time. This game is considerably darker than the original and the sequel in both look and feel. Even the digitized voices are deeper in tone, creating a sense of urgency about it. Things are obviously not right in Space Harrier&apos;s world. But if you&apos;re familiar with the original, the premise is the same; blow everything up and fight the boss at the end.</story>

    <story>Three girls have been reported missing including the mayor&apos;s daughter, and Chase Special Investigations has asked you to track down five vehicles, mentioned in the mission briefing, who are believed to be involved in the kidnapping. Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles. The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it. Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn&apos;t waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.</story>

    <story>Brutal Deluxe doesn&apos;t live up to their name - in fact they&apos;re the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 &apos;legs&apos; with the aggregate score deciding who progresses. You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents. The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are &apos;portals&apos; which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going. You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important. A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team&apos;s power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.</story>

    <story>Kujakuo is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the late eighties and drawn by Makoto Ogino. It is a tale of the occult, centred around the buddhist monk Kujaku. In this game, Kujaku is sent out by his master, Ajari, to find out what has happened at the nearby temple of Hieizan. Upon arriving, after having fought his way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain. One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his last breath, he utters the word Izumo. Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin. Kujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game, Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts, you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic Spacehead. The adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point out specific objects for your verbs. In the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though. This game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.</story>

Spidey can duck jump, climb walls, punch, shoot webs to swing (by pressing punch and jump together) and perform a jump kick (by pressing the punch button twice). Collecting web cartridges allows Spidey to shoot limited web projectiles. Although hard to die, Spidey has only one life, there are no items to recharge life (but killing some guys will do so) and only one continue.</story>

    <story>Streets of Rage, Sega&apos;s answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a Mr. X where crime is rampant, which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the syndicate by themselves. Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter. Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature death drops where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level. Several items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).</story>

    <story>After Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, the city became a peaceful place to live, and each one of them followed their own paths. One year later, after their reunion, Adam&apos;s brother Sammy returned from school to find their apartment in a mess, and Adam nowhere to be seen, and after calling his two friends, one of them notices a photo of Adam chained to a wall, next to someone they knew very well - Mr. X, who returned to turn the peaceful city once again into a war zone. Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel&apos;s good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good... Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways. There are changes in both graphics (characters now are bigger, more detailed and with more animation frames, and scenarios are less grainy) and gameplay (the rocket move was replaced by a special move that doubles in offense and defense along several new moves), along other new features such as life bars (and names) for all enemies and the radically different new characters.</story>

He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held. The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.</story>

The world&apos;s most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them. Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game&apos;s frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</story>

    <story>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected. T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill. Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</story>

The next level can also be reached to by chasing Jerry to the end of the round where he will be cornered. There are also damage points that are taken away from Tom as he is hit by the number of dangerous environments around him. Too many hits will also result in a game over. It is just another hard days work for Tom the cat!</story>

    <story>Back in the solar year 2000 there was a nuclear war, and people are finally now emerging from underground to build a new society. But something is still wrong. DALAUS, a leftover computer from the old world is creating its own empire, and it is up to you to stop it. To complete this mission you will pilot a CA-214 (the TransBot), a new experimental astro-plane. TransBot is a side scrolling shooter for one or two players. There are a wide variety of enemies you will need to get past to be victorious throughout the many locations. The CA-214 can have different types of weapons to help out. You start out with a basic, default gun, but after collection a ? symbol you can choose a new weapon to use. There are six choices which will scroll past at the top of the screen, and your TransBot will be powered with whatever selection you make. Powered up weapons will only last for a limited amount of time before the TransBot reverts back to the basic weapon.</story>

    <story>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd&apos;s classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six &apos;Wedges&apos; you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports. Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select &apos;yes&apos; or &apos;no&apos; to tell it whether you got it right. The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</story>

    <story>The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the eight virtues and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you&apos;d help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the right thing to do. The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn&apos;t nailed down even if it didn&apos;t belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you&apos;d never finish the game. This VERY different approach to the game&apos;s ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final Holy Grail type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.</story>

    <story>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it&apos;s own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting. The gameplay can be tweaked for the players&apos; preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection. Graphically, the game is similar to EA&apos;s Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker&apos; 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</story>

The odd-numbered stages require you to shoot gunslingers that hang out at saloons, hotels, and towns. When a gunslinger threatens you with a gun, you have only seconds to shoot him before you lose some life. If this happens, you can increase your life meter if you shoot barrels that are scattered across town, and then detonating the bomb that is revealed, wiping out gunslingers in sight. You must be careful not to shoot innocent civilians or gunslingers who surrender, or you also lose life. At the end of these rounds, the leader will come out of a building and will move side-to-side, occasionally shooting you if he has the chance. In the even-numbered stages (except stage six), you are required to ride across a desert, shooting gunslingers that ride past you. You can increase life by shooting the only gunslinger not on a horse and then detonating the bomb that is revealed. At the end of these levels, you will be faced with a challenging stage, where the object is to shoot as many targets as you can before time runs out.</story>

Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego&apos;s plans. Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player&apos;s knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen&apos;s gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.</story>

That&apos;s why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom&apos;s only line of defense against these menaces. There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can&apos;t be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don&apos;t collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you&apos;ll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you&apos;ll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts. There are also warp-gates, but you don&apos;t find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you&apos;ll get further in the round.</story>

    <story>Wonder Boy III: The Dragon&apos;s Trap is a direct sequel to Wonder Boy in Monster Land. When Tom-Tom defeats the MEKA dragon, the wounded beast casts a spell on him, turning him into a Lizard-Man. To regain your original human form, you have to find the Salamander Cross, hidden by the Vampire Dragon in Monster Land. In this side-scrolling platform game, you can still buy equipment and items, but unlike its predecessor, it is not divided in sequences of levels. You are allowed to go anywhere, as long as you have the right shape or equipment. During his quest, Tom-Tom has to defeat various dragon bosses. Each win will give you a new shape with new abilities such as flying, swimming, walking on ceilings or clinging to walls, which also give you to access new parts of the world. The possible shapes are Lizard-Man, Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Lion-Man and Hawk-Man and the main abilities are defined by attacking power, defense points and charm points (needed for equipment by collecting charm stones). Also, certain blocks can only be destroyed by specific weapons or are only accessible to certain shapes. The basic actions consist of attacking and jumping, and in the status screen you can equip swords, shields and armour. Special attacks include fire balls, tornadoes, arrows, boomerangs and thunder strikes. Along the way, you collect keys (only one at all times) and gold left behind by defeated creatures, and you often have to revisit places to access new areas. A password is given at the beginning of each town to continue from there.</story>

The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together. Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land&apos;s last hope. There are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the city of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he&apos;ll also lose health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore the lost health.</story>

    <story>For the third World Cup in succession, US Gold had the license to produce the official game. They entrusted Tiertex with the task, who produced a top-down game recreating the full tournament. As well as the 24 teams who qualified for the tournament, other significant footballing nations like England, France and Denmark could be drafted in. The presentation of the menus is largely icon-based, with the official mascot featuring prominently. Tackling is difficult and passing is easy, making for a flowing end-to-end style of play.</story>

    <story>Xenon 2: Megablast is vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin&apos;s Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels. The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key. A typical Bitmap Brothers smash, the game is also famous for its soundtrack by British electronica group Bomb The Bass.</story>

    <story>You are Adol (Aron in Sega Master System version) Christian, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day you encounter a fortuneteller who sends you on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long you learn that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in Sega Master System version, Malificus in PC version). It is your task to defeat the villain and to discover the secret of Ys! Ys is an action RPG with original combat: instead of pressing the attack button, you simply run into the enemies you encounter. You do more damage if you run into them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in Adol&apos;s death if the monster is stronger than him. You gain gold and experience points for defeating your foes; once you have gained enough experience, you level up and become stronger. You can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.</story>

    <story>This is a 3-D update to the arcade classic. Like most shooters, the backdrop is set in space. The first part of the battle is spent shooting down opposing fighters, snagging more powerful weapons, speed power-ups and fuel. Not only do you have to worry about the enemy, your fuel is working against you as well. The second part of the battle is to grab fuel and take out ground forces through a 3-D corridor and dodging walls. The final part of the battle is the end boss.</story>

Baron Ricks has...There are eight rounds in the game, and the gameplay is split into two parts. In the odd-numbered rounds, you ride a bike known as the Tri Formation which has the Zillion laser beam attached to it. As well as shooting Norsa warriors, you must jump over gaps and the pulsating areas of the floor. If your character comes in contact with their shots, or rides over the pulsating areas of the floor, your life meter will decrease. If that meter is empty, you lose a life. Power-ups can be obtained that will give you the Armorator or extra life. In Rounds 5 and 7, you are required to use the Armorator to survive the round. You can also change between Apple and Champ during these rounds, but only once each.And on the even-numbered rounds, you run-and-shoot your way to a boss. Beware of the Norsa Warriors and other enemies. The same rules apply to those of the odd-numbered rounds, where being shot at or fall in a gap will result in you losing a life. </story>
